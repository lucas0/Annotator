<hr/><h3>A LITTLE KNOWN FACT OF TEXAS HISTORY</h3>
<font size="+1">
Not very many of you folks out there know all about
Texas history.  Here's some of the more "colorful"
moments in the archives of this great
state, and some of her true characters.<br/><br/>

Laura Bush, an amateur genealogical researcher,
discovered that her husband's great-great uncle,
Chadsworth Bush, a fellow lacking in
character, was hanged for horse stealing and train
robbery in Texas in 1889.<br/><br/>

The only known photograph of Chadsworth Bush
shows him standing on the gallows.<br/>
On the back of the picture is this inscription:
"Chadsworth Bush; horse thief,
sent to Texas Prison 1885,
escaped 1887, robbed the Texas Flyer six times.<br/>
Caught by Pinkerton detectives, convicted and
hanged in 1889."<br/><br/>

After letting George W Bush and his staff of
professional image onsultants peruse the findings,
they decided to crop Chadsworth's picture, scan it
in as an enlarged image, and edit it with image
processing software so that the biographical sketch
was sent to the Associated Press as follows:<br/>
"Chadsworth Bush was a famous rancher
in early Texas history.  His business empire
grew to include acquisition of valuable
equestrian assets and intimate dealings
with the Texas railroad...<br/>
Beginning in 1883, he devoted several years
to service at a government facility, finally
taking leave to resume his dealings with the railroad.<br/><br/>

"In 1887, he was a key player in a vital investigation
run by the renowned Pinkerton Detective Agency.<br/>
In 1889, Chadsworth Bush passed away
during an important civic function
held in his honor when the platform upon
which he was standing collapsed."<br/><br/>

And thus passed the very first "hanging Chad."
