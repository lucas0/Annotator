allowed only to the extent of the aggregate amount with respect to
which the taxpayer is at risk (within the meaning of subsection (b))

         in such property).
    No property shall be taken into account as security if such prop-
    erty is directly or indirectly financed by indebtedness which is
    secured by property described in paragraph (1).
       "(3) CERTAIN BORROWED AMOUNTS EXCLUDED.—For purposes of

note.              P L A N S . — T h e Congress, in a series of laws (the Regional Rail Reorga-
45 u s e 701       nization Act of 1973, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of
note.              1974, the T r a d e Act of 1974, and the T a x Reduction Act of 1975) and
29 u s e 1001      this Act has made clear its interest in encouraging employee stock own-
note,              ership plans as a bold and innovative method of strengthening the free
19 u s e 2101.     private enterprise system which will solve the dual problems of secur-
26 u s e 1 note.   jj^^ capital funds for necessary capital growth and of bringing about
                   stock ownership by all corporate employees. The Congress is deeply
                   concerned t h a t the objectives sought by this series of laws will be made
                   unattainable by regulations and rulings which treat employee stock
                   ownership plans as conventional retirement plans, which reduce the
                   freedom of the employee trusts and employers to take the necessary
                   steps to implement the plans, and which otherwise block the establish-
                   ment and success of these plans. Because of the special purposes for
                   which employee stock ownership plans are established, it is consistent
                   with the intent of Congress to permit these plans (whether structured
                   as pension, stock bonus, or profit-sharing plans) to distribute income
                   on employer securities currently.
