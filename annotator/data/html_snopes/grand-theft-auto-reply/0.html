<h1 class="head1">Press Release </h1>
<p class="wide">4 December 2002 </p>
<h2 class="head2">Return to Sender</h2>
<h2 class="head3">Blue-chip Group tif. advises caution over Auto Reply
		Office Security </h2>
<div style="width:80%">
<p align="LEFT">UK office workers are today being advised to use caution
		  when writing 'away from office' auto reply email messages because of a new
		  email security risk first discovered at a meeting of industry group The
		  Corporate IT Forum - tif.</p>
<p align="LEFT">tif., a blue-chip membership association representing 120
		  of Britain's largest organisations with over 3.6 million employees worldwide
		  and 1.3 million desktop computers is issuing the warning after it emerged that
		  criminals are able to discover the personal details, and in some cases the home
		  addresses, of staff through cross-referencing the information contained in
		  'away from office' email messages. </p>
<p align="LEFT">The advisory is being issued by tif. in an effort to make
		  Britain's office workers more aware of the potential risk and to give them a
		  few simple guidelines to follow to ensure the practice does not escalate any
		  further.</p>
<p align="LEFT">The 'away from office' function, a part of everyday life
		  for many office workers, can be set to send automatic replies from an e-mail
		  account saying that a person is, for example, away on holiday between certain
		  dates. The function is especially popular among businesses that need to inform
		  clients and customers of absences and ensure that enquiries are re-directed to
		  another member of staff. </p>
<p align="LEFT">The new practice involves criminals buying lists of
		  so-called 'spam' email addresses, now readily available over the internet, and
		  sending mass mailings with the intention of gaining 'away from office' replies
		  with details of holiday absences. Using online directories such as www.192.com
		  or www.bt.com, would-be burglars can cross-reference the information contained
		  within the automatic email replies, such as name, telephone number and business
		  address, to find out the personal details and even the home address of the
		  sender.</p>
<p align="LEFT">tif., whose membership includes 47% of the FTSE 100 and
		  collectively spends £20 billion each year on IT, also warns that people
		  with unusual names, and especially those living in smaller towns, are
		  particularly vulnerable to this new practice as uncommon names can be tracked
		  down more easily. Furthermore, tif. members urged company bosses to think twice
		  before revealing their status in an 'away from office' email signature. Job
		  titles can give a would-be burglar a good idea of a possible haul and a
		  managing director being away from home or out of the country can make a
		  tempting target.</p>
<p align="LEFT">Chief executive of tif, David Roberts comments: "You
		  wouldn't go on holiday with a note pinned to your door saying who you were, how
		  long you were away for and when you were coming back so why would you put this
		  in an email? Email is the most popular form of office communication but many
		  people forget that the information contained in these messages can get into the
		  wrong hands. There's no reason why this threat should become common practice
		  but employees and businesses should act now to stop it - there are a few simple
		  precautions we should all take to help nip this in the bud." </p>
<p align="LEFT">tif. has issued a series of simple recommendations for
		  office workers to follow and for businesses to incorporate into their email
		  policies.</p>
<h2 align="LEFT" class="head2">tif. Recommends</h2>
<p align="LEFT">Advice comes on behalf of tif.'s Information Security
		  Group.</p>
<p align="LEFT" class="wide">Do's</p>
<ul>
<li> Keep messages as bland as possible. Say that you are currently
			 'unable to deal with this query' or that you are 'out of the office on
			 business'.</li>
<li> Redirect enquiries to a colleague's business telephone number so
			 someone else can assess the enquiry and verbally inform the caller of a period
			 of absence.</li>
<li> If you have an important sounding job title, think very carefully
			 about whether you want to reveal your job title to a wide audience. </li>
<li> Be very careful with giving away alternative contact details, only
			 include them if the person concerned has agreed.</li>
<li> Always prepare for your absence and pre-warn key contacts
			 personally of your holiday.</li>
</ul>
<p align="LEFT" class="wide">Don'ts</p>
<ul>
<li> Never say that you are away on holiday, out of the country, or
			 that you are away from the office between certain dates. </li>
<li> Never put alternative personal contact details on an 'away from
			 office' message.</li>
<li> Never put home address details, home phone numbers or personal
			 mobile phone numbers on messages.</li>
<li> Never put a colleague's personal contact details on a message.
			 </li>
<li> Never set 'away' messages on home or personal email accounts.</li>
</ul>
