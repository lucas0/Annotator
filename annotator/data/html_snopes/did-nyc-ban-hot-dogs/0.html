</p><p align="center"><b><i>Laws and actions  will drive a nearly 30% additional reduction in greenhouse emissions by 2030  and spur tens of thousands of good jobs</i></b></p>
<p><b>NEW  YORK—</b>Mayor  de Blasio today announced New York City's Green New Deal, a bold and audacious  plan to attack global warming on all fronts. It is comprised of $14 billion in  new and committed investments, legislation and concrete action at the City  level that will ensure a nearly 30 percent additional reduction in emissions by  2030. The laws and investments of New York City's Green New Deal will directly  confront income inequality, generating tens of thousands of good-paying jobs  retrofitting buildings and expanding renewable energy.</p>
<p>You  can read the full report <a href="https://onenyc.cityofnewyork.us/">here</a>.</p>
<p>"Every  day we wait is a day our planet gets closer to the point of no-return. New York  City's Green New Deal meets that reality head on," said <b>Mayor Bill de Blasio</b>.  "We are confronting the same interests that created the climate crisis and  deepened inequality. There's no time to waste. We're taking action now, before  it's too late."</p>
<p>New  York City is not only taking steps to adhere to the Paris Climate pact, it is  frontloading the most significant greenhouse gas reductions for the coming  decade, before it's too late. The City is going after the largest source of  emissions in New York by mandating that all large existing buildings cut their  emissions - a global first. In addition, the Administration will convert  government operations to 100 percent clean electricity, implement a plan to ban  inefficient all-glass buildings that waste energy and reduce vehicle emissions.</p>
<p>The  Green New Deal policies are laid out in "OneNYC 2050: Building a Strong and  Fair City," a new, comprehensive plan to prepare our city for the future and  leading the way for the nation on how to address the existential threats posed  by climate change, economic insecurity, inequity, and rising global  intolerance.</p>
<p>Combined  with the de Blasio administrations previous actions, the actions announced  today will lead to a nearly 30 percent reduction in emissions citywide. In  combination with actions taken prior to this administration, New York City on  track to achieve a 40 percent reduction in emissions from a 2005 baseline by  2030 -- the breaking point to turn back the most devastating and irreversible  consequences of climate change.</p>
<p>The  announcements today will reduce our emissions by the following percentages from  a 2005 baseline:</p>
<p><b>10%:</b> Mandating that all large, existing  buildings implement retrofits to be more efficient and lower emissions – a  global first.<br/> <b>6%:</b> OneNYC initiatives to further reduce  emissions including more renewable energy, expanded energy efficiency in  buildings and reduced reliance on fossil fuel vehicles.<br/> <b>5%:</b> Pursuing a deal to power 100% of City  operations with clean electricity sources like Canadian hydropower.<br/> <b>2%:</b> Cleaning up vehicle fleet and  implementing congestion pricing.</p>
<p>The  above actions will account for a <b>23 percent</b> reduction in emissions.  Previous actions taken by the de Blasio administration, such as phasing out  dirtier heating oil, have already resulted in a <b>5 percent</b> reduction. The  total reduction secured through actions of the de Blasio administration will  reach <b>28 percent</b>. When added to reductions made under the prior  administration, New York City will reach a total emissions reduction of <b>40  percent</b> by 2030 and putting ourselves on track for full carbon neutrality  by 2050.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">New  York City's Green New Deal</span></p>
<ul type="disc">
<li><b>Committing to carbon neutrality by 2050, and 100% clean       electricity.</b> The City will pursue steep cuts in greenhouse gas emissions from buildings       and source 100% clean electricity, while creating green jobs and holding       polluters responsible for climate-related costs.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<ul type="disc">
<li><b>Requiring buildings cut their emissions – a global       first.</b> With the passage of the building mandates law, New York City is the first       city in the world to require all large existing buildings of 25,000 square       feet or more, of which there are 50,000 citywide, to make efficiency       upgrades that lower their energy usage and emissions – or face steep       penalties.</li>
</ul>
<ul type="disc">
<li><b>Banning new inefficient glass-walled buildings.</b> The City will no longer allow       all-glass facades in new construction unless they meet strict performance       guidelines, making inefficient glass-heavy building designs a thing of the       past.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<ul type="disc">
<li><b>Hydro-powered City government.</b> The City, working with       partners, will pursue 100 percent carbon-free electricity supply for City       government operations with the building of a new connection linking New       York City to zero-emission Canadian hydropower. Negotiations will begin       right away, with the goal of striking a deal by the end of 2020 and       powering city operations entirely with renewable sources of electricity       within five years. This action is the equivalent of converting the entire       state of Vermont to clean energy. </li>
</ul>
<ul type="disc">
<li><b>Mandatory organics recycling.</b> The City will make organics       collection mandatory citywide, expanding the country's largest organics       management program, including curbside pickup, drop-off sites, and support       for community composting opportunities.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<ul type="disc">
<li><b>Reducing waste and carbon-intensive consumption.</b> The City will end unnecessary       purchases of single-use plastic foodware, phase out the purchase of       processed meat, reduce the purchase of beef by 50 percent and commit to a       carbon neutral City fleet by 2040</li>
</ul>
<ul type="disc">
<li><b>Aligning with U.N.'s Sustainable Development Goals.</b> With OneNYC, New York City was       the first city to map our local strategy to the SDGs and to submit a       Voluntary Local Review to the United Nations. The Voluntary Local Review       monitors New York's advancement toward the goals, identifies areas where       we can learn from others, and addresses remaining challenges. By       demonstrating directly in our strategy how OneNYC aligns with the SDGs, we       strengthen our efforts to build a strong and fair city and deepen the city       diplomacy that makes New York City a leader on the world stage.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Preparing  for the Effects of Climate Change</span></p>
<ul type="disc">
<li><b>Comprehensive resilience planning.</b> The City is executing our $20       billion resiliency plan to address the growing threats of coastal storms,       sea-level rise, extreme heat, and increased precipitation with projects       and programs across the city. These investments will save lives and       people's homes as New York prepares for the effects of climate change that       are already locked-in.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Solving  our Transportation Challenges</span></p>
<ul type="disc">
<li><b>Help New Yorkers get moving.</b> The City will support the       implementation of congestion pricing to reduce traffic in Manhattan and       help fix our broken subway system, while also improving bus speeds 25       percent by the end of 2020. We will speed up our buses through expanded       and improved bus lanes, stronger bus lane enforcement, and signal       improvements that prioritize buses as they travel through city streets.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<ul type="disc">
<li><b>Reclaim city streets.</b> The City will meet the needs of the public by ensuring       better buses to increase efficiency in all five boroughs; increasing       off-hour deliveries to help ease congestion; and creating People Priority       Zones that restrict vehicular access, create public spaces, improve       safety, reduce congestions, and improve air quality. We will start with a       zone in Lower Manhattan to test a potential expansion citywide. </li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Ensuring  Social Equity and Jobs</span></p>
<ul type="disc">
<li><b>Promoting New Yorkers' health.</b> The City will guarantee health       care for every New Yorker, to create the most comprehensive, universal       coverage in the nation for uninsured New Yorkers, regardless of ability to       pay or immigration status. The City will focus on ending the opioid       epidemic and deploy engagement teams alongside first responders to support       people with mental health and substance misuse needs.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<ul type="disc">
<li><b>Building a fairer city for all.</b> The City will explore       expanding the IDNYC municipal ID card to enable banking access for the       more than 1 million underbanked New Yorkers; and will continue protecting       tenants from displacement and supporting working New Yorkers by       aggressively enforcing fair wage and work regulations.</li>
</ul>
<p>Since  the launch of the original OneNYC strategy in 2015, New York City has been a  global leader in progressive policies that serve all New Yorkers and secure a  sustainable future. Amid this progress, our city and its residents continue to  face numerous challenges today. These include pervasive social and economic  inequities; at-risk infrastructure; and an exposed and endangered waterfront  threatened by a climate change emergency. OneNYC is our blueprint to meet these  challenges head-on.</p>
<p>OneNYC  lays out our aspirations for the City we want to build by 2050. It contains  eight goals that respond to core challenges facing New York City today; 30  initiatives the City and our partners need to undertake to meet those goals by  2050; and more than 80 specific new metrics and targets to guide City leaders  and hold us accountable.</p>
<p>The  OneNYC strategy was developed following months of engagement with a diverse  cross-section of 16,000 New Yorkers from across the city. The City convened a  39-member Advisory Board of community leaders, advocates, elected officials,  and policy experts, as well as 26 regional leaders to discuss shared challenges  and opportunities to collaboratively address shared regional needs. In the  coming months, the de Blasio administration will continue the conversation with  residents, civic leaders, and elected officials to refine initiatives and  encourage civic engagement.</p>
<p>"Here  in New York City, we recognize our climate crisis for what it is - an emergency  - and also that what matters most is not words, but action," said <b>Daniel  Zarrilli, NYC's Chief Climate Policy Advisor and OneNYC Director</b>. "With  today's release of OneNYC 2050, we are demonstrating to the world what a green  new deal looks like in practice. Taking on the fossil fuel industry, getting  our emissions to net zero, building greater resiliency citywide, and creating  an inclusive economy - these may not be easy, but they are necessary if we are  to secure a livable future for the next generation. And by taking action now,  we are building a strong and fair city for all New Yorkers."</p>
<p>"If  someone tells you the Green New Deal won't work, tell them to come to New York  City," said <b>Mark Chambers, Director of the Mayor's Office of Sustainability</b>.  "There are no sidelines in the fights against global warming and inequality –  either we act or we forfeit our future."</p>
<p>"Our  investments in resiliency are focused on ensuring New York City is prepared to  withstand and emerge stronger from the impacts of climate change," said <b>Jainey  Bavishi, Director of the Mayor's Office of Resiliency</b>. "Climate change  presents an unprecedented threat, but with the Green New Deal we have the  opportunity to address inequality, create thousands of new jobs, and build a  stronger and more resilient city for generations of New Yorkers to come."</p>
<p>"From  harnessing the power of our upstate water supply to phasing out the use of  dirty heating oil in the five boroughs, New York City is leading the way in  fighting climate change," said <b>DEP Commissioner Vincent Sapienza</b>.   "Moving forward we will continue to transition our wastewater treatment  facilities to resource recovery operations where we can harvest additional  clean energy to help reduce our carbon footprint."</p>
<p>"The  updated OneNYC plan sets the stage for a New York that is well prepared to  address the realities of climate change and income inequality. It does so while  recognizing the need to invest in and improve our mobility and quality of life  infrastructure- both critical to the retention and growth of a workforce that  serves as the underpinning for a resilient and growing economy," <b>Larisa  Ortiz, Principal, Larisa Ortiz Associates and New York City Planning  Commissioner</b>, <b>OneNYC Advisory Board Member.</b></p>
<p>"Mayor  Bill de Blasio's OneNYC 2050 is a breakthrough of historic proportions. The  Mayor's goals for sustainable development ensure that NYC will be in the global  forefront of the 21st century. One NYC 2050 gets it just right, putting vibrant  democracy, an inclusive economy, excellence in education, health lives and a  sustainable environment into a holistic plan, one that will benefit all New  Yorkers and the world. With this launch, NYC will now move into high gear of  leading the nation's Green New Deal," said <b>Jeffrey D. Sachs, University  Professor at Columbia University and Co-Chair of the OneNYC Advisory Board</b>.</p>
<p>"The  work we do to ensure that our City's parks and open spaces are equitable,  sustainable and resilient is critical in advancing the goals of OneNYC. From  neighborhood playgrounds and parks to our urban forests and natural areas, we  strive to contribute to the health and wellbeing of New Yorkers, today and for  decades to come, "said <b>NYC Parks Deputy Commissioner, Chief Operating  Officer Mark Focht</b>.</p>
<p>"New  York City takes a bold step on this Earth Day as we incorporate a commitment to  global engagement into our local strategy of OneNYC," said <b>Penny  Abeywardena, Commissioner of the Mayor's Office for International Affairs</b>.  "As host city to the United Nations, New York City shares innovations with the  world through our Global Vision|Urban Action program and the Voluntary Local  Review tool to drive solutions to the most pressing challenges concentrated in  cities including climate change, migration and inequality. The new OneNYC plan  shows how our local efforts align with and advance the UN's Sustainable  Development Goals, because the future of the world depends on city leadership  today."</p>
<p>"New  York City is a leader in fighting climate change, and the Department of  Sanitation is proud to be part of this effort," said <b>Acting Sanitation Commissioner  Steven Costas</b>. "Organic waste makes up more than one third of everything  New Yorkers throw away, and when it breaks down it emits harmful methane gas.  To address this issue, we will expand our organics management program, already  the largest in the nation, to create citywide, mandatory organics recycling. We  look forward to working with City Council and other stakeholders to take  action, and we will continue to work toward our goal of sending zero waste to  landfills."</p>
<p>"The  City of New York is leading the way in addressing the climate crisis," said <b>Lisette  Camilo, Commissioner of the NYC Department of Citywide Administrative Services</b>.  "We are leading by example through better government operations. The City is  improving energy efficiency in its government buildings, replacing gas-powered  fleet vehicles with electric vehicles, and considering environmental impacts  when we purchase the goods and services we use. This Earth Week we should all  redouble our efforts to build a more sustainable future for New York City."</p>
<p>"Earth  Day is about coming together as a planet and committing to protect our  environment, which is why I am so proud this City Council last week took the  ambitious step of passing the Climate Mobilization Act, one of the most  aggressive legislative mandates any city has ever taken to combat global  warming. The package requires that medium and large buildings dramatically cut  their greenhouse gas emissions, among other measures. The Council has a long,  proud history leading the fight against climate change, including requiring  that the OneNYC sustainability report be submitted every four years, electric  vehicle charging stations in parking lots and garages, and establishing the  organic waste curbside collection program. I am pleased to see that, following  last week's passage of the Climate Mobilization Act, the Administration is  expanding these measures to further reduce the effects of climate change in the  city. I look forward to working with the Mayor to implement these measures,"  said <b>Council Speaker Corey Johnson.</b></p>
<p>"As  an original cosponsor of the Green New Deal, I'm fighting for reductions in  carbon emissions at the Federal level, but the Trump Administration and our  colleagues across the aisle remain tethered to oil company interests and  outdated energy policies that are killing our planet. The House Foreign Affairs  Committee, which I now Chair, is pushing legislation to fight climate change,  including H.R. 9, the Climate Action Now Act. But we cannot be sure the GOP  controlled Senate will act on this critical issue. Therefore, it's more  important than ever for state and local municipalities to take the lead in  reducing harmful greenhouse gases. I applaud Mayor de Blasio, the City Council  and City officials for once again making NYC a climate leader by committing to  a 40 percent reduction in emissions by 2030. And I will continue to push for  similar or greater emissions reductions at a national level," said <b>Representative  Eliot Engel</b>.</p>
<p>"As the federal government fails to acknowledge the  urgency of the climate crisis, New York City is leading the way by taking bold  and decisive action for a clean energy future. An investment in our environment  means not only cutting emissions and expanding renewable energy, but also  creating good jobs and improving the quality of life of all New Yorkers as we  move toward a greener, healthier city. I commend Mayor de Blasio for his  leadership and commitment to resiliency and sustainability," said <b>Representative  Jose Serrano</b>.</p>
<p>"New  York can be a leader for the rest of the nation in combatting the growing  threat of climate change. Addressing this pressing danger will require working  federally, locally and internationally. I'm hopeful that by adopting a Green  New Deal, New York City can help lead the way for other cities, states and  localities in reducing carbon emissions and building a more sustainable economy  that creates jobs and opportunity, while preserving our planet for future  generations," said <b>Representative Nydia M. Velázquez</b>.</p>
<p>"Climate  change is one of the most dangerous threats we currently face, and we need to  get serious about combatting it now. I'm proud that New York City is taking  this threat head on, and I will continue working down in Washington to ensure  the rest of the country follows New York's lead," said <b>Representative  Carolyn Maloney</b>.</p>
<p>"Investing in the protection of our environment means  investing in the future of the next generation of New Yorkers. The OneNYC plan  not only serves to shrink New York City's carbon footprint – it strives to  reduce income inequality by providing thousands of job opportunities for city  residents. I applaud Mayor de Blasio's leadership and look forward to working  together to build a healthy, sustainable New York," said <b>Senator Alessandra  Biaggi</b>.</p>
<p>"People  around the world are already experiencing the devastating effects of climate  change, but the worst is yet to come. With the federal government refusing to  take serious action, cities like New York are rising up to the challenge of  addressing the most pressing issue of our time," said <b>Assembly Member Dan  Quart.</b> "OneNYC is exactly the kind of bold action we need."</p>
<p>"Once  again, New York City is taking the lead," said <b>Assembly Member Richard N.  Gottfried</b>.  "We'll show America how to take strong action to protect  our planet from the catastrophic effects of global warming."</p>
<p>"I'm truly excited about the progress of the program OneNYC.  New York City has been leading the way in the climate change initiative and  the  OneNYC program helps us continue that development by cutting  emissions from New York's largest source of emissions and creating 27,000  well-paying jobs to implement the retrofits. I commend Mayor Bill de Blasio for  the OneNYC program and the chance to help ensure a 40 percent reduction in  emissions by 2030," said <b>Assembly Member Latrice Walker</b>.</p>
<p>"Climate  change is an existential threat, and I thank Mayor de Blasio for accelerating  plans to reduce waste and carbon-intensive consumption," said <b>Manhattan  Borough President Gale A. Brewer. </b>"The Manhattan Solid Waste Advisory  Board, of which I appoint members to, is looking forward to working with the  administration to reach these important goals."</p>
<p>"I'm  in for a Green New Deal. From grassroots advocates, who have been sounding the  environmental alarm for decades, to my fellow local elected colleagues, our  shared mission is to make aggressive moves that combat the climate change  crisis threatening the very existence of our planet. It's about readopting the  goals of the Paris Agreement to reach 100 percent clean, renewable energy —  including deeper exploration of generating solar, wind, and geothermal power in  this region — as much as it is about accepting the personal challenge to reduce  our carbon footprint in what have been more unsung ways. I am particularly  thrilled that this City has taken up our mantle to reduce our overconsumption  of meat through the phasing out of processed meat purchasing and the reduction  of beef purchasing; make no mistake, addressing the carbon-intensive activity  of meat production is a sustainable solution for the health of our bodies and  our planet alike. This is a good next step, but is far from the full scope of  what we must commit to as a society to reverse this ocean liner of bad  decisions. We must be far more assertive in our investment to go green, from  public transportation to building design. Nearly 50 years after the first Earth  Day celebration, the clock is ticking on our ability to secure a sustainable  future for our children and grandchildren," said <b>Brooklyn Borough President  Eric Adams.</b></p>
<p>"So  often it has been that when we build, we kill. I'm excited that we in city  government have found direction to correct a vision of the past and move  forward with a vision of sustainability and set benchmarks to save our planet.  I applaud the Mayor and anyone in government who stood talk to make these  regulatory changes," said <b>Council Member Andy King.</b></p>
<p>"Intro.  1253, our Clean Tower Plan, will be the largest carbon emissions reduction ever  mandated by any city, anywhere," said <b>Council Member Costa  Constantinides, Chair of the Committee on Environmental Protection</b>.  "This bill represents two years of hard work to ensure affordability and  sustainability weren't pitted against each other. Thanks to the partnership  between the City Council, led by Speaker Corey Johnson, and the Mayor's Office  of Sustainability, we have a clear, fair path to shrink the carbon footprint of  large buildings 40% by 2030 -- exactly the kind of action New York City needs  to reduce the effects of climate change." </p>
<p>"Just as the Council did last week, the Mayor is laying out  a bold strategy for tackling climate change, one of the most important  challenges our species has ever faced," said <b>Council Member Carlos Menchaca</b>.  "This is more than an environmental issue. It's a human rights issue of the  highest order. And the City of New York is leading the way as it always does.  The new OneNYC plan is hopefully the first domino in a series of bold climate  action across the country."</p>
<p>"While  Washington D.C. continues to ignore its responsibility to combat climate  change, I am proud to be a part of a collaboration with the New York City  Council and de Blasio administration that is doubling down on the need to  drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions, eliminate plastic waste and  improve our mass transportation system to decrease our reliance on personal  vehicles," said <b>Council Member Donovan Richards</b>. "Preserving our planet  for future generations is the most important mission we have today and I am  thankful to have so many dedicated fighters in this City pushing the difficult  conversations so we can continue to show the world that we are up to the  challenge. I'd like to thank Mayor de Blasio, Speaker Johnson, my City Council  colleagues and all of the advocates that have put in so much work to guide us  on this critical path that is OneNYC 2050."</p>
<p>"New  York City's Green New Deal is the bold vision that we need to address our  climate crisis. I am a proud co-sponsor of the City Council's Climate  Mobilization package which passed last week. This legislation and policies  implemented by the de Blasio administration will set world-wide standards for  cutting emissions while creating good-paying jobs. These efforts are critical  to achieving environmental, social, and economic sustainability. I commend the  leadership of Speaker Corey Johnson, Environmental Committee Chair Costa  Constantinides, and Mayor de Blasio for their work making New York City the  leader in the fight against climate change," said <b>Council Member Helen  Rosenthal</b>.</p>
<p>"Study  after study by the scientific community has reinforced the impact humans have  on climate change," stated <b>Council Member Rafael Salamanca</b>. "Around the  globe, sea levels are rising and cities continue to register record-breaking  temperatures. While others fail to act despite mountains of evidence, the New  York City Council and the de Blasio administration are taking a leading role in  implementing critical policy to reduce New York City's carbon footprint. The  historic package of legislation approved by the City Council focusing on an  array of environmental issues, including requiring large buildings to reduce their  emissions, is model legislation that cities around the country are looking to  emulate. The policy we implement today will have a lasting effect on the planet  that we leave our children and their children. I look forward to working with  my colleagues in the City Council, the administration and stakeholders across  the city to further impact positive change on this very important issue."</p>
<p>"What  better way to honor Earth Day than by standing with the Mayor and other elected  officials who have worked so hard to make New York a greener, safer city? DC 37  is proud to be part of the effort to end dirty buildings, reduce carbon  emissions, and create good jobs," said <b>Henry Garrido, Executive Director,  District Council 37</b>.</p>
<p>"This  Earth Day New Yorkers can be proud," said <b>Bill Lipton, State Director of the  NY Working Families Party</b>. "Thanks to years of work by grassroots climate  justice organizations, allies in the City Council, and Mayor de Blasio, New  York City is showing that the Green New Deal isn't just an idea or a plan, it  can be the reality in cities across the country."</p>
<p>"Climate  change and inequality are two of the most pressing issues of our times. The  RWDSU represents workers in retail, grocery stores, warehouses and more, all of  whom are impacted by inequality and climate change. We applaud the Mayor for  creating OneNYC 2050, which is a comprehensive vision for addressing these  issues. Superstorm Sandy was a stark reminder of the reality of climate change  and its relationship to inequality. All working people deserve to live on a  healthy planet, free from poverty. If we do not follow through with the vision  of OneNYC 2050, we do so at our own peril," said <b>Stuart Appelbaum President  of RWDSU</b>.</p>
<p>"New  York City is setting a new standard for U.S. cities by taking bold action to  address the climate crisis.  Buildings account for more than two-thirds of  emissions in New York City and new efficiency standards will dramatically  reduce our carbon footprint. We expect our state leaders to follow New York  City's lead and adopt new climate mandates that strengthen our cities and towns  through the passage of the Climate and Community Protection Act," said <b>Stanley  Fritz, Campaign Manager for Citizen Action of New York.</b></p>
<p>"The  business community intends to be a full partner in achieving the climate,  transit and social equity goals being announced today by Mayor de Blasio. New  Yorkers are united in our commitment to confront these challenges," stated <b>Kathryn  Wylde, President &amp; CEO, Partnership for New York City</b>.</p>
<p>"I  think the intersection of equity and climate readiness is the most important  challenge for improving the resilience of cities. And this plan tackles both in  bold and innovative ways," said <b>Michael Berkowitz, President, 100 Resilient  Cities</b>.</p>
<p>"While cities occupy only two percent of the world's  landmass, they have an enormous climate footprint with more than 70% of global  CO2 emissions. With 90 percent of the world's urban areas situated on  coastlines, cities are also at high risk from some of the devastating impacts  of climate change, such as rising sea levels and powerful coastal storms. For  millennia, cities have helped nurture some of mankind's greatest ideas, and it  is no surprise that New York City is rolling out 'OneNYC2050: Building a Strong  and Fair City.' I commend and welcome this paradigm shift that will not only  result in emissions reduction of 40% by 2030 from a 2005 baseline - while  generating tens of thousands of green new jobs, but also offer a scale model  for other cities around the world to benefit from and emulate," said <b>Satya  S. Tripathi, United Nations Assistant Secretary General and Secretary of the UN  Environment Management Group</b>.</p>
<p><b>Julie  Tighe, President of the New York League of Conservation Voters</b>, said "While  the federal government is denying climate change, New York City is taking  action to reduce our carbon footprint and make our communities more  sustainable.  NYLCV applauds Mayor de Blasio for advancing the OneNYC 2050  plan to make New York City greener throughout our power, transportation, and  buildings sectors. The city is setting bold goals of achieving carbon  neutrality and drastically reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 that will  require real actions and investments.  Many of NYLCV's top priorities are  included OneNYC 2050 - from cutting emissions from our buildings, to improving  water and air quality, to making our streets safer, our transportation systems  stronger, and our fleets greener, to expanding access to green spaces for all  New Yorkers. We thank the Mayor for advancing this ambitious plan and look  forward to working with the Administration to ensure we make meaningful  progress to achieve these goals."</p>
<p>"OneNYC  offers a vision for the future of New York City with climate solutions and  clean air at its core," said <b>Andy Darrell, Chief of Strategy, Global Energy  &amp; Finance at Environmental Defense Fund</b>. "This Earth Day, New Yorkers  can also be grateful for implementation underway on congestion pricing, pension  fund investment in climate solutions and less pollution coming from buildings –  all strong, practical steps to achieve environmental goals."</p>
<p>"I'm  pleased to stand with the Mayor today to support NYC's new building emissions  law, a landmark in urban environmental policy," said <b>John Mandyck, CEO of  Urban Green Council.</b> "We look forward to rolling up our sleeves to assist  with its implementation as well as innovations to accelerate the energy  retrofit market."</p>
<p>"By  coordinating and driving critical infrastructure investments under the guiding  principles of sustainability and resiliency, New York City is making life  better for current residents and future generations," said <b>Carter  Strickland, New York State Director for The Trust for Public Land</b>.   "We have to address the challenges of living in cities – where nearly 70% of  people will live by 2050 – and New York City's policies on sustainable  transportation, water systems, and efficient buildings are leading the way."</p>
<p>"The  latest update to the City's OneNYC plan clearly demonstrates that we can tackle  the climate crisis head-on and make a better city for all," said <b>Tom  Wright, President, Regional Plan Association and OneNYC Advisory Board Member</b>.  "Whether its congestion pricing that raises funds for better mass transit,  a carbon-neutral city with cleaner air or commitments to invest in our  residents and their neighborhoods, OneNYC meets the urgent need to act with a  comprehensive vision for success."</p>
<p>"OneNYC  2019 is an innovative move towards ensuring an equitable and sustainable future  for New York City.   I appreciate its attention to our urban  environment and encourage the development of strategies that will protect the  most vulnerable communities in our City. We must continue to work together to  ensure that its approach remains inclusive for all New Yorkers for generations  to come," said <b>Christine Appah, NY Lawyers for the Public Interest, OneNYC  Advisory Board Member. </b></p>
<p>"New  York City is creating a cleaner and more equitable future for all New Yorkers  with OneNYC 2050 and the new initiatives that will reduce global warming  emissions from buildings and cut waste and pollution from billions of  single-use carryout bags," said <b>Eric A. Goldstein, New York City Environment  Director at the Natural Resources Defense Council</b>. "We look forward to  working with the Mayor and his team to advance the effective implementation of  these and other programs that prioritize environmental protection and make the  City a national leader on sustainability."</p>
<p>"Cities  are key sites where innovation and experimentation will have to take place to  meet the rapidly advancing climate change challenge," said <b>William  Solecki, Co-Chair of the New York City Panel on Climate Change and Professor of  Geography at CUNY Hunter College</b>. Actions proposed under OneNYC 2050 and  associated Green New Deal for NYC will help keep New York at the cutting edge  of what cities are doing by showing how transformative climate action can  support the promise of climate resilience development pathways under conditions  of equity."</p>
<p>"OneNYC  2050 showcases New York City as a global leader on climate change," said <b>Emily  Nobel Maxwell, New York City Program Director at The Nature Conservancy</b>.  "The Conservancy supports the strong commitments to carbon neutrality and  100 percent clean electricity, which will put New York City on a path to  becoming stronger and more resilient. We applaud the emphasis on nature as a  critical solution to pressing challenges facing our communities, including  threats to public health, equity, and adapting to climate change. We look  forward to working with the City to bring this vital plan to life."</p>
<p>"The  OneNYC 2050 plan sets the vision for New York City to continue to exemplify a  sustainable and resilient city for the world.  With an eye on  accountability and bringing the plan to life in every neighborhood, we can  expect to see improvements in access to healthcare, increased participation in  our democracy, and greater opportunity for our residents of all ages, to build  skills for a modern workforce.  We have the foundation for our children  and their children to live their best lives in the best city for many years to  come," said <b>Francine Rosado-Cruz, Global Learning &amp; Development  Director, Diversity &amp; Inclusion, Microsoft</b>.</p>
<p>"Climate  change isn't fair, and OneNYC 2050 lays out an equitable vision of a green new  deal in action to ensure New York's world-leading climate action won't leave  the city's most vulnerable behind," said <b>David Miller, Director of  International Diplomacy at C40</b>. "Mayor de Blasio and his team boldly  developed OneNYC 2050 in line with the city's ambitious target to be carbon  neutral by 2050, championing the objectives of the Paris Agreement and  positioning New York and Mayor de Blasio as global climate leaders."</p>
<p>"The  U.N. report on climate change, whose co-authors included a member of the PSC,  showed that the planet can still be saved from the worst effects of climate  change if dramatic action is taken by 2030. There is no time to lose. We  applaud the Mayor for refusing to wait for action on the federal level and  announcing plans to take action in New York City. The members of the PSC are  eager to support an initiative that couples good jobs with reduced emissions.   Both are possible - and must be achieved.  It would be immensely powerful  to make that happen in New York City," said <b>Dr. Barbara Bowen,  president of the Professional Staff Congress/CUNY</b>.</p>
<p>"OneNYC  2050 is a comprehensive and ambitious plan to make the biggest city in the  United States the most vibrant, equitable, livable, and climate smart city in  the world as well. The Science for Climate Action Network congratulates Mayor  de Blasio and his administration for leading the way and offers its support in  using climate science to build a clean and just energy economy," said <b>Richard  Moss, Founding Director, Science for Climate Action Network; Visiting Fellow,  American Meteorological Society</b>.</p>
<p>"With  OneNYC and a host of other initiatives, our city has provided galvanizing  global leadership on climate policy and politics—and climate culture too,  consistently supporting work to spark the conversations we need across New York  City's diverse communities. We're proud to have partnered with NYC on a  citywide exhibition and more, and proud to be creating America's first climate  museum right here in NYC where it belongs," said <b>Miranda Massie, Director,  The Climate Museum</b>.</p>
<p>"The  health of New Yorkers is vitally dependent on a wide range of physical, social,  economic and environmental factors" said <b>Dr. Anthony Shih, President of  United Hospital Fund</b>. "I commend the visionary OneNYC strategy to build a  strong and fair city by addressing the critical challenges of our generation,  paving the way for a better tomorrow."</p>
<p><b>Amy  Davidsen, Executive Director of The Climate Group, North America said</b>: "As one of the  largest cities in the U.S, New York City is significantly upping its ambition  on climate action through the introduction of its own Green New Deal. This  ambitious policy will help to significantly accelerate the adoption of clean  electricity and smart, efficient buildings, as well as driving more sustainable  solutions for clean transport. By setting a target of going carbon neutral by  2050, we hope other cities in the US and globally are inspired to follow suit."</p>
<p>"A  sustainable, resilient and equitable city is best achieved through partnership  at all levels of government, the private sector and directly with communities.  We applaud Mayor de Blasio and his staff, along with organizations like ours,  for taking action to make our city a more livable, equitable and thriving place  by 2050. Our parks and open spaces offer us the opportunity to mitigate against  a changing climate while providing much-needed recreational amenities for  residents and in the process create jobs, opportunities and a healthier city,  and OneNYC 2050 is a strategy to achieve these goals," said <b>Alex Zablocki,  Executive Director, Jamaica Bay-Rockaway Parks Conservancy</b>.</p>
<p>"One  NYC 2050 is a transformative plan to improve the lives of all New Yorkers,"  said <b>Jennifer Jones Austin, CEO &amp; Executive Director, Federation of  Protestant Welfare Agencies</b>. "The strong partnerships envisioned by this  new strategic plan will ensure a more equitable and fair city with improved  opportunities for civic participation, healthcare, and economic stability for  all."</p>
<p>In  the absence of Federal and regulatory support to help fight climate change,  it's up to cities like New York to lead the charge. By weaving economic justice  and environmental sustainability issues together into one comprehensive plan,  OneNYC 2050 presents a roadmap for preparing citizens for the challenges and  opportunities ahead," said <b>Christine Arena, executive producer, Let  Science Speak</b>.</p>
<p>"New  York City is the most dynamic city in the world, and we're thrilled to see a  OneNYC 2050 plan that pushes the bounds of urban climate leadership, promising  carbon neutrality, climate resiliency, and thousands of well-paying jobs. We  look forward to the opportunity for all New Yorkers to participate in and  benefit from the City's efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and work  toward a livable climate for generations to come," said <b>Amy Turner,  Executive Director, NYC Climate Action Alliance</b>.</p>
<p>"Climate  change and inequality represent an existential threat and moral crisis for our  city, which is now taking action at the scale of the challenge. We are so proud  of mobilizing the activism and campaign to help achieve this world-first law  requiring large polluting buildings like Trump Tower to clean up their act.  It's the beginning of a Green New Deal for New York," said <b>Rachel Rivera, a  Sandy survivor and New York Communities for Change</b>.</p>
<p>"OneNYC  2050 is an expansive vision for NYC today and tomorrow, covering all aspects of  life in the Big Apple," said <b>Fred "Doc" Beasley, Founder and Chapter  President of NYC HIP HOP Is GREEN.</b>  "Designed to keep New Yorkers  healthy, the economy robust and the environment safe. The Green Deal for NYC  aligns perfectly with the six fundamental pillars of HIPHOP IS GREEN: plant  based eating, urban farming, food justice, animal rights, exercise, and  sobriety. We stand united with Mayor de Blasio as he introduces cutting edge  concepts that continue to define New York City as the global prototype in solution  based leadership."</p>
<p>"New  York City Nature Goals 2050 is a coalition of over 70 organizations that have  come together around the common belief that all New Yorkers have a right to  healthy nature. The coalition has developed five goals for 2050: improved  biodiversity and habitat; air and water quality; coastal protection and  resilience; connectivity for plants and animals; and inspiration. The coalition  has also developed a Declaration of Rights to New York City Nature. Inclusion  of NYC Nature Goals 2050 in OneNYC is a testament to the city's commitment to  prioritizing healthy and accessible nature. Not only is this a right of all  citizens, it is a critical part of our city's infrastructure – as much as  roadways, education and public safety. Our coalition looks forward to working  with Mayor de Blasio to reach our goals," said <b>Sarah Charlop-Powers,  Executive Director of the Natural Areas Conservancy</b>.</p>
<p>"We're  proud to stand with the City as it announces OneNYC 2050 and the Green New Deal  for NYC that promise to make our communities more resilient and sustainable in  the face of climate change," said <b>Christie Peale, CEO/Executive Director of  the Center for NYC Neighborhoods.</b> "We also applaud the City's  recommendation for supporting retrofits in the Green New Deal for the thousands  of homeowners, especially in coastal communities, who may bear the brunt of  rising sea levels. Let's lay the groundwork together to ensure that residents  aren't displaced by the high costs of adapting their homes."</p>
<p>"The  CUNY Urban Food Policy Institute has been a strong advocate for leveraging the  power of the 'public plate' to encourage healthier and more environmentally  sound diets. New York's OneNYC 2050 plan commits the City to phase out  purchasing processed meat and sets an ambitious target for reducing beef  purchasing by 50%. These are just the sorts of policy actions we believe are  necessary for improving public health and addressing the environmental  challenges of the coming decades," said <b>Craig Willingham, Deputy  Director of the CUNY Urban Food Policy Institute.</b></p>
<p>"I  want to extend my heartfelt thanks to Mayor de Blasio and everyone else in the  NYC government for taking this important step to address climate change and  economic inequality. If we want to prevent the worst from happening, then we  need to act now, and in the absence of federal leadership, we need cities such  as NYC to take the lead. I hope that every city will work with NYC to build a  more sustainable and equitable economy, especially by reducing support for  industrial animal agriculture and increasing support for food systems that are  better for humans, animals, and the environment all at the same time,"  said <b>Jeff Sebo, Director of the NYU Animal Studies MA Program.</b></p>
<p>"Once  again Mayor de Blasio has demonstrated his vision for New York City as a  national leader and role model with OneNYC 2050 and the plan's strategies  designed to meet the formidable challenges facing our city and our planet. In  particular, the phase-out of processed meat and significant reduction of the  city's beef purchases create a triple win—for the environment, our children's  health, and animal welfare," said <b>Jane Hoffman, President, Mayor's Alliance  for NYC's Animals.</b></p>
<p>"Mayor  de Blasio's plan goes a long way to protect animals, our environment, and the  well being of all New Yorkers. Eating one piece of processed meat a day  increases one's chances of developing colorectal cancer and beef products are a  climate catastrophe. New Yorkers can be proud their city continues to be a leader  for animals and our environment," said <b>Allie Feldman, Founder and President  of Voters for Animal Rights.</b></p>
<p>"The  Humane Society of the United States applauds Mayor de Blasio for tackling  critical sustainability challenges in a most innovative way -- by committing to  reduce the city's purchase of processed meat and beef products," said <b>Brian  Shapiro, New York State Director for the HSUS</b>. "In addition to causing  enormous suffering to animals, meat production generates a staggering amount of  water and land degradation and greenhouse gas pollution. Reducing meat will  dramatically shrink the city's footprint and has multiple environmental effects  that will benefit communities far beyond NYC."</p>
<p><b>Amie  Hamlin, Executive Director of Coalition for Healthy School Food </b>said<b>, </b>"We  are grateful to the Mayor for this progressive step. Eliminating processed  meats and reducing all meats has been a priority of the Coalition for Healthy  School Food, and this is something we have worked on tirelessly. Reducing meat  is better for the planet, it will benefit children's health and it's kinder to  animals. In 2012, we helped New York City create a vegetarian menu that schools  can opt in to, and we will continue to help schools make the transition,  furthering the healthy, planet-friendly, compassionate choices available to  children and those who work in the schools."</p>
<p>"New  York City took a historic step last week to becoming a global climate leader by  passing Dirty Buildings legislation, and we are pleased that Mayor de Blasio is  committing to further steps to reduce emissions across the five boroughs. With  the Trump administration asleep at the wheel on the climate crisis, cities and  states must continue to lead the way," said <b>Gladys Puglla, Board Chair of  Make the Road New York</b>.</p>
<p>"The  OneNYC 2050 plan strengthens the connection between the serious issues of  equity and climate change. Connecting these two threads is a critical aspect of  meeting an urgent challenge and New York City is taking the lead by addressing  them together," said <b>Adam Parris Executive Director, Science and Resilience  Institute at Jamaica Bay</b>.</p>
<p><b>Maritza Silva-Farrell, Executive Director of ALIGN</b> "We have a historic opportunity to protect our communities and mitigate the devastating effects  of climate change, the time to act is now! We applaud Mayor de Blasio's proposal for a Green New Deal for NYC, taking an important action to target the biggest sources of emissions while creating thousands of good union jobs and fighting inequality. This is a a critical step to building a green economy and a sustainable, just future for our city and a model for the country."</p>
<p>"On behalf of our members and their families, I applaud Mayor de Blasio for laying out a real vision for protecting New York City’s future," said <b>Peter Ward, President of the New York Hotel Trades Council</b>. "Global climate change is real, and the Mayor’s ONE NYC 2050 gives us a thoughtful and dynamic road map for driving investment into sustainable development and preserving our environment for future generations of New Yorkers. We are proud to back this plan."</p>
