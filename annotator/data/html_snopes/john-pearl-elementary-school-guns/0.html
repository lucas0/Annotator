  a   felony   shall   be  presumed  to  have  no  prior  conviction.  The
  superintendent of  state  police  shall  annually  review  the  laws  of
  jurisdictions  within  the  United States and Canada with respect to the

  safety  and storage information and which shall also contain a toll free
  telephone number for the purpose of allowing any purchaser to  call  and
  receive  additional  information  regarding  the  availability  of local
  courses in self-defense training and safety in the use of a self-defense
  spray device.
    (b) Before delivering a self-defense spray device to any  person,  the
  licensed  or  authorized  dealer  shall require proof of age and a sworn
  statement on a form approved by the superintendent of state police  that
  such person has not been convicted of a felony or any crime involving an
  assault.  Such  forms shall be forwarded to the division of state police
  at such intervals as directed by the  superintendent  of  state  police.
  Absent  any such direction the forms shall be maintained on the premises
  of the vendor and shall be open at all reasonable hours  for  inspection
  by  any  peace  officer or police officer, acting pursuant to his or her
  special duties. No more than two self-defense spray devices may be  sold
  at any one time to a single purchaser.

  shall  require training in the use of the police baton including but not
  limited to the defensive use of the baton and instruction in  the  legal
  use  of  deadly  physical  force pursuant to article thirty-five of this
  chapter. Notwithstanding the provisions of this  section  or  any  other
  provision  of law, possession of such baton shall not be authorized when
  used intentionally to strike another person except in  those  situations
  when  the  use  of  deadly  physical force is authorized by such article
  thirty-five.
