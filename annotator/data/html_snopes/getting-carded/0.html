</li><li><strong>Are there any volunteer opportunities at your Annual Conference (or Midwinter Meeting)?</strong>
<br/><p></p>
Each year for the Annual Conference, the Chapter Relations Office puts together a group of student volunteers from the chapters to assist ALA staff at the conference.  To qualify, each student must be a current ALA member and a member of a student chapter, and cannot have previously participated in the program.  Although each school has its own selection process (i.e. random drawing, essay contest, etc.), the chosen student's name must be submitted to ALA by the group's faculty advisor.  One student will be accepted per chapter.  
<p></p>
In exchange for working 4 hours per day at the conference, each student will receive free conference registration, housing, and a per diem for meal expenses.  Transportation costs (such as airfare and cabs) are the student's responsibility.  This program is only available at Annual Conference.  At this time, there are no volunteer opportunities at Midwinter Meetings.

<br/><br/><hr/><h3><a name="4"></a>How can I become a librarian? Does ALA offer any classes?</h3><br/><p>
The ALA web site has information on how to become a professional librarian. This position usually requires that a librarian have a master's degree in library and information science. ALA is the professional organization that accredits the master's degree programs at nearly 60 universities all over the country (and in Canada and Puerto Rico, as well). ALA accredits master's degrees <i>only</i>; it does not accredit undergraduate degrees or certificates in librarianship - which do exist. 
</p><p>
<b>While there are bachelor's degrees in library science, it is not necessary to get one of these in order to prepare for the master's degree; the undergraduate degree can be in any subject.</b> What ALA's accreditation hopes to show is that the librarian, as opposed to the library technical assistant or technician, is indeed worthy of professional designation and description, having successfully completed a graduate-level discipline and course of study.
</p><p>
Undergraduate degrees and certificates are usually associated with library paraprofessional work, those support staff positions that carry the title of library technical assistant or library technician or any similar variations--see <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100703033807/http://www.ala.org/ala/educationcareers/careers/paths/listsupportstaff.cfm">List of Support Staff Positions in Libraries</a>. 
</p><p>

A: ALA policy 54.2 states: "The master's degree from a program accredited by the American Library Association (or from a master's level program in library and information studies accredited or recognized by the appropriate national body of another country) is the appropriate professional degree for librarians."
</p><p>
For <b>school librarians</b>, ALA policy 54.2.2 states: "The master's degree in librarianship from a program accredited by the American Library Association (emphasis added) OR a master's degree with a specialty in school library media from an educational unit accredited by the National Council for the Accreditation of Teacher Education (NCATE) is the appropriate first professional degree for school library media specialists."

ALA doesn't provide classes in the truest sense, that would count toward a master's degree. However, ALA makes available several various continuing education opportunities; <a href="https://web.archive.org/#9">see this question</a> for details.<br/><br/><hr/><h3><a name="5"></a>How many libraries are there?</h3><br/>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100703033807/http://www.ala.org/library/fact1.html">ALA Library Fact Sheet Number 1</a>, last updated March 2010, reports that there are an estimated 122,566 libraries of all kinds in the United States. 
<p></p>
No annual survey provides statistics on all types of libraries. Public, academic, and school library counts on that fact sheet come come from surveys by the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100703033807/http://nces.ed.gov/">National Center for Education Statistics (NCES)</a> and the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100703033807/http://www.imls.gov/">Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS)</a>. Figures for special libraries, armed forces libraries, and government libraries come from the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100703033807/http://books.infotoday.com/directories/amerlib62.shtml"><i>American Library Directory<small><sup>TM</sup></small> 2009-2010</i></a> compiled by the publisher, Information Today, Inc.<br/><br/><hr/><h3><a name="6"></a>What is ALA's governing structure?</h3><br/>ALA is governed by a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100703033807/http://www.ala.org/ala/aboutala/governance/council/index.cfm">186-member policy-making council</a> elected directly by members; an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100703033807/http://www.ala.org/ala/aboutala/governance/officers/index.cfm">executive board</a> made up of four officers elected by members, plus eight members elected by Council, that is responsible for the oversight management of ALA; and an <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100703033807/http://www.ala.org/ala/aboutala/governance/officers/directory/index.cfm">executive director, Keith Michael Fiels</a>, who administers ALA headquarters and its <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100703033807/http://www.ala.org/Template.cfm?Section=stafflists&amp;Template=/CFApps/Information/staff_directory.cfm">250-member staff</a>.
<br/><br/><hr/><h3><a name="7"></a>I am wondering if you have any data regarding loss rate that may have been collected as part of surveys of your members or in any other form. </h3><br/>There is no "standard" rate of book loss, not that ALA has created - and we don't believe that any other organizations have attempted to create such a figure. The reasoning and extent in reporting library theft varies, and so a national figure might not be reliable. Such statistics are only collected locally, and not on a national basis, so we must rely on general articles to describe the extent of the problem.<br/><br/>

There are various surveys that have been performed over the years, but without any regularity or periodicity.  <i> Circulation, Interlibrary Loan, Patron Use, and Collection Management: A Handbook for Library Management, </i> by David F. Kohl (Santa Barbara, Calif: ABC-CLIO, 1986) reports a range of research studies relating to loss rates.  While no rate is "acceptable," what is typical, based on these studies is a loss of .15% to .5% per year; or overall loss rates of 4-8% when an inventory, or inventory sample, is conducted periodically. <br/><br/>

In her book <i> Managing Overdues, </i> Patsy J. Hansel extrapolates from surveys she conducted to posit a national "overdue rate" of .7 percent pre-automation and .4 for post-automation to suggest a national loss of 6.28 million items, or $125.6 million at a rate of $20 per book.  The number of items was based on 1994 NCES circulation data. <br/><br/>

Finally, Richard Boss in his 1999 report on library security technologies cites an "anecdotal" figure of a 3% loss rate which Judith Gelertner extends to being a $70,000 a year cost for a 50,000 volume collection, using 2005 book replacement cost figures. <br/><br/>

How do I get it into libraries?</h3><br/><p></p>
Please be aware that individual libraries are responsible for their own collections. There is no one place that distributes books to all libraries -- and that includes ALA. Although, some main libraries purchase books for their branches as well as themselves. And some libraries purchase their books through such distributors as Baker &amp; Taylor, Ingram Book Services, Emery-Pratt Company, and other book suppliers and wholesalers. At best, ALA can review your book in its publication, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100703033807/http://www.ala.org/ala/aboutala/offices/publishing/booklist_publications/booklist/insidebooklist/booklistproc/proceduressubmitting.cfm">Booklist</a>.

<b>National Gaming Day (NGD), which <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100703033807/http://gaming.ala.org/resources/index.php?title=Ngd2008">debuted in 2008</a>, will have its third annual celebration nationwide on Saturday, November 13, 2010.

In the 21st century, libraries are about much more than books. National Gaming Day presents hundreds of libraries throughout the country the opportunity to showcase their gaming programs and services. Gaming of all types at the library encourages young patrons to interact with a diverse group of peers, share their expertise with others (including adults), and develop new strategies for gaming and learning. Plus, it's a way for traditionally underserved groups to have fun in the library and interact with other members of the community.

<p></p><br/><br/><hr/><h3><a name="41"></a>I do a lot of traveling and visit libraries all over the country. What would make the visits more enjoyable would be if ALA would institute a National Library Card that I could use at any and all of them.</h3><br/>This remains a popular suggestion from library users and patrons year after year. However, neither ALA nor PLA (Public Library Association, a division of ALA &lt;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100703033807/http://www.ala.org/pla">http://www.ala.org/pla</a>&gt;) coordinate national public library service. Please be aware that ALA is a private, professional nonprofit organization to which members--both individual librarians and organizational libraries--must pay dues to belong. Not necessarily every librarian or library are members of ALA. Public libraries are overseen not by ALA, but by their <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100703033807/http://dpi.state.wi.us/pld/statelib.html">State Library</a>.
<p></p>
Due to the process by which public libraries are funded, the establishment of any national reciprocal borrowing privileges is a bit more complex than you might imagine. Public libraries in the U.S. are set up under a local governance model, as the majority of funding for most public libraries comes from local taxes. On average, nationwide, local taxes are responsible for over 80% of public library funds, with 10% coming from state sources; federal interests contribute less than 1%. 
<p></p>
Also, there is <i>no</i> mechanism set up by which the materials borrowed by "national" library users and patrons could be returned to their home institutions—which are presumably a state or more away--in a timely manner. Nor is there a mechanism to ensure that these materials <i>would</i> be returned. Creating such a multi-state secure mechanism that would protect and secure the varied collections of all of the libraries across the country from any misuse or abuse of a national borrowing system would pose a formidable challenge.
<p></p>
Over the years, public libraries have made great strides in resources sharing, through the development of inter-library lending procedures, cooperative partnerships, regional networks, and even some statewide networks. But a single all-state borrowing card and system would be difficult to develop.

<br/><br/><hr/><h3><a name="46"></a>As stated on the reunion of the cast of the 1970s ABC-TV television show, <i>Happy Days</i>, is it true that after the airing on September 27, 1977, of the episode titled, "Hard Cover," in which the show's most popular character, Fonzie,  portrayed by actor Henry Winkler, got a library card, that library card registrations by children suddenly received a dramatic increase, as much as 500%?</h3><br/>Yes, as discussed in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100703033807/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0424134/">Happy Days 30th Anniversary Reunion</a> television special that first aired on the ABC network on February 12, 2005, the Fonzie character did encourage his buddies to get a library card (the "<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100703033807/http://www.sitcomsonline.com/season5.html">Hard Cover</a>" episode already has a claim to fame as being the first episode after Fonzie, <i>ahem</i>, "jumped the shark" in the season's three-part opener), but the American Library Association has been unable to document an increase in signups of the magnitude suggested by Winkler. Only a few states track the number of library cards held with any reliability, and there is no report in ALA's <i>American Libraries</i> or in any other library press periodical telling of a surge in signups in the months following the episode.
<p></p>
The number of library cards in the United States is one statistic that isn't collected for the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100703033807/http://harvester.census.gov/imls/pub_survdesign.asp"><i>Public Libraries in the United States</i></a> federal survey series by the Institute of Museum and Library Services. Neither does a number appear in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100703033807/http://infotoday.stores.yahoo.net/bowanlibandb3.html">The Bowker Annual Library and Book Trade Almanac</a>. There's a hesitation to collect and present such numbers, due to the fact that the accuracy of them would vary from library to library. 
<p></p>
For example, ALA publishes its own annual public library survey through its Public Library Association (PLA, a division of ALA), the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100703033807/http://www.ala.org/ala//pla/plapubs/pldsstatreport/pldsstatistical.cfm">Public Library Data Service (PLDS) Statistical Report</a>, which is conducted on a random sampling of about 1,000 public libraries all over the US, of various population served sizes and locations. The survey questionnaire does ask each library to provide its number of "library registrations" but with the caveat: "Report this figure only if the library has purged its file at least once within the last three years. If not, indicate by putting N/A in the space." Many of the participating libraries, which are individually named in the report, do provide a number, but dozens of them do not. Patrons move away, or pass away, and citizens are under no obligation, legal or otherwise, to inform public libraries of their own or a relative's status and its effect on the library’s number of registrations. 
<p></p>
In short, there is no way to prove--<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100703033807/http://www.bartleby.com/66/83/25383.html">or disprove</a>--the statement.

The celebration emphasizes the importance of literacy for children of all linguistic and cultural backgrounds.
<p></p>
Día is an enhancement of Children’s Day, which began in 1925.  Children’s Day was designated as a day to bring attention to the importance and well-being of children.

The discounts range from 20% to 90% with the deepest discounts going to those communities with the greatest need based upon the local eligibility levels for participation in the National School Lunch
Program (NSLP).
<p></p>
The E-rate has played a pivotal role in helping libraries connect their users to the Internet. Today more than 95% of our nation's libraries offer Internet access to the public. This is compared to 1996 when 28% of library systems that offered public access to the Internet in at least one branch. With more than $350 million in discounts since 1998, the E-rate has helped change the public
library's information technology landscape.

Nominators are members of teen book groups in fifteen school and public libraries around the country. Nominations are posted on Support Teen Literature Day during National Library Week, and teens across the country vote on their favorite titles each year. Readers ages twelve to eighteen voted online between Aug. 24 and Sept. 18; the winners will be announced in a webcast featuring WWE Superstars and Divas during Teen Read Week.

<b><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100703033807/http://www.ala-apa.org/about/nlwd.html">National Library Workers Day (NLWD) will next be celebrated on Tuesday, April 13, 2010</a></b>.
<p></p>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100703033807/http://www.ala-apa.org/about/nlwd.html">National Library Workers Day (NLWD) was celebrated on Tuesday, April 14, 2009</a>. 
<p></p>
National Library Workers Day (NLWD) is an opportunity to celebrate the people who make libraries work, because "Libraries Work Because We Do."  On the Tuesday of National Library Week, libraries host events that recognize the value, variety of responsibilities and contributions of library employees. 
<p></p>
Events have included parties sponsored by friends groups or trustees, bulletin boards with profiles of library staff so patrons can get to know them better, and personalized handmade "I appreciate you" cards given out by staff to one another.  More ideas about how to publicize and celebrate can be found on the NLWD page on the ALA-APA web site, at:<br/>

<p></p>
The entire statement can be found in Circular 21, <i>Reproduction of Copyrighted Works by Educators and Librarians</i>, of the Copyright Office, which appears online as an Adobe Reader PDF (Portable Document Format) document, at:<br/>

This statement includes links to key policy documents previously prepared by the American Library Association.<br/><br/></p><hr/><h3><a name="64"></a>Who is the author of the ALA website?  When did the site begin?</h3><br/>ALA began its public electronic era in the 1988-89 fiscal year, when several staff were provided "bitnet" accounts, courtesy of the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC).  On May 12, 1991, the first subscription-based electronic list--<i>ALCTS Network News</i> (AN2)--was launched (AN2 was discontinued in 2002).  More accounts and many more <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100703033807/http://lists.ala.org/">e-lists </a>followed. 
<p></p>
In July 1994, ALA launched a Gopher, using the server at the University of Illinois at Chicago. There is a review of the Gopher service in the March 1995 <i>American Libraries.</i>
<p></p>
On March 21, 1996, ALA moved to its own server, and began the process of migrating the material on the Gopher to the web site, www.ala.org.  All units were provided "space" on the Gopher ... and the web.  This space has become increasingly sophisticated as units have gained expertise in web presentation of material of interest to our members, prospective members, and others who have an interest in the mission of the ALA.
<p></p>
In the fall of 2001, ALA Information Technology and Telecommunications Services (ITTS) Unit has contracted with a content management firm to assist in the redevelopment of the site.  This "new" website launched April 7, 2003.  It is the product of over 100 web content developers, and there is no single "webmaster."
<p></p>
The ALA web is funded by the general ALA budget, with much of the developmental support coming from individual unit funds (for the staff involved in preparing the web pages or for outside contractors hired).  In some cases, members directly support the web development as part of their volunteer work for the Association when they prepare pages--or even maintain whole linked websites.  The web--with its nearly 40,000 pages--is continuously updated
<p></p>
The main ALA URL -- <a href='https://web.archive.org/web/20100703033807/http://www.ala.org"/'>http://www.ala.org</a> -- remains the same as it has been since we first launched a website. Many division, round tables and office URLs also transferred to the new site. There are, however, many underlying addresses or URLs that will be changed in the transition. Enhanced search features and a detailed site maps are available in the new site to assist members and visitors in finding information. 
<p></p>
During the week of January 19, 2004, URLs on ALA's Web site were shortened to enhance the site's usability and allow users to refer to its pages more easily in print and other publications. This change to the site's structure did not affect any existing references to the longer URLs found on the site previously. All "old" URLs will automatically "redirect" to new ones, so that if you have bookmarked one of our pages, referred to it in print, or linked to it from somewhere else on the Web, you will be automatically redirected to the appropriate content. 
<p></p>
The most recent changes to the ALA Web Site, taking place from 2007 on through 2008, have been extensively tracked and duly reported by Karen Muller, ALA Librarian and Knowledge Manager, in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100703033807/http://discuss.ala.org/marginalia/category/ala-website/">ALA Marginalia Blog in the ALA Web Site category</a>.
