<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#000099"><font size="-1">A
Proclamation by the President of the United States of America</font></font></font></b>
</p><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#000099"><font size="-1">On
Veterans Day, we pay tribute to the service and sacrifice of the men and
women who in defense of our freedom have bravely worn the uniform of the
United States.</font></font></font></b>
</p><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#000099"><font size="-1">From
the fields and forests of war-torn Europe to the jungles of Southeast Asia,
from the deserts of Iraq to the mountains of Afghanistan, brave patriots
have protected our Nation's ideals, rescued millions from tyranny, and
helped spread freedom around the globe. America's veterans answered the
call when asked to protect our Nation from some of the most brutal and
ruthless tyrants, terrorists, and militaries the world has ever known.
They stood tall in the face of grave danger and enabled our Nation to become
the greatest force for freedom in human history. Members of the Army, Navy,
Air Force, Marines, and Coast Guard have answered a high calling to serve
and have helped secure America at every turn.</font></font></font></b>
</p><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#000099"><font size="-1">Our
country is forever indebted to our veterans for their quiet courage and
exemplary service. We also remember and honor those who laid down their
lives in freedom's defense. These brave men and women made the ultimate
sacrifice for our benefit. On Veterans Day, we remember these heroes for
their valor, their loyalty, and their dedication. Their selfless sacrifices
continue to inspire us today as we work to advance peace and extend freedom
around the world.</font></font></font></b>
</p><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#000099"><font size="-1">With
respect for and in recognition of the contributions our service members
have made to the cause of peace and freedom around the world, the Congress
has provided (5 U.S.C. 6103(a)) that November 11 of each year shall be
set aside as a legal public holiday to honor America's veterans.</font></font></font></b>
</p><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#000099"><font size="-1">NOW,
THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of America,
do hereby proclaim November 11, 2008, as Veterans Day and urge all Americans
to observe November 9 through November 15, 2008, as National Veterans Awareness
Week. I encourage all Americans to recognize the bravery and sacrifice
of our veterans through ceremonies and prayers. I call upon Federal, State,
and local officials to display the flag of the United States and to support
and participate in patriotic activities in their communities. I invite
civic and fraternal organizations, places of worship, schools, businesses,
unions, and the media to support this national observance with commemorative
expressions and programs.</font></font></font></b>

President Chaney's Remarks at the Veterans Day Wreath Laying Ceremony </font></font></font></b>
<br/><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#3333FF"><font size="+1">Arlington
National Cemetery</font></font></font></b>
<br/><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#3333FF"><font size="+1">Arlington,

<br/><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#3333FF"><font size="+1">November
11, 2008</font></font></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#3333FF"><font size="+1">THE
VICE PRESIDENT: Thank you. Thank you very much Secretary Peake; members
of Congress; leaders of Veterans Service Organizations; members of the
official delegation from Iraq and other distinguished guests; military
families; fellow citizens. Thank you all for the welcome, and good morning
to you all. I'm grateful for the honor of participating in this important
ceremony. Let me give a special word of thanks to the Color Guard, to the
U.S. Army Band, and to active duty personnel gathered here at Arlington.
It's a privilege to be with all of you, and I bring good wishes from the
President of the United States, George W. Bush.</font></font></font></b>
</p><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#3333FF"><font size="+1">Just
a few moments ago, on the President's behalf, I presented a wreath at the
Tomb of the Unknowns. Standing watch today, as always, are the Tomb guards
of the Third U.S. Infantry Regiment. The careful rituals of the Old Guard
have made it one of the legendary units of the United States Army. Their
vigil goes on without fail, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. It's a high
honor for anyone to be selected as a Tomb guard, and I want to commend
these fine American soldiers for carrying out their duty with great skill
and dignity.</font></font></font></b>
</p><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#3333FF"><font size="+1">This
holiday for the nation used to be called Armistice Day, after the document
signed on the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month in the year 1918,
which brought to an end the First World War. Well over four million Americans
served in that conflict, and all of them are now gone except for one. He
is Frank Buckles of Charles Town, West Virginia, who 90 years ago today
was
on active duty in the United States Army. Our last Doughboy is nearly 108
years old, and on this Veterans Day thinking of him with the greatest respect
and pride.</font></font></font></b>
</p><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#3333FF"><font size="+1">Corporal
Buckles is a living connection to a war fought long ago, to a time when
America deployed a great Army to oppose the enemies of freedom. Only 23
years after the Armistice, our nation was called to another difficult global
task in the biggest war we have ever had to fight. When that struggle was
over, we had turned back dictatorship and militarism across the globe,
and former adversaries became friends of the United States. The Second
World War ended more than 60 years ago, yet many Americans still remember
it well. And we're pleased to be joined in the amphitheater today by veterans
of World War II.</font></font></font></b>
</p><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#3333FF"><font size="+1">Also
present are military veterans from the eras of the Cold War, Korea, Vietnam,
the Persian Gulf War, and the ongoing campaigns in Iraq and Afghanistan.
We welcome all of you, and we thank you for your service and for being
here with us today.</font></font></font></b>
</p><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#3333FF"><font size="+1">Veterans
Day finds us, once again, as a nation at war. The conflict began with a
direct attack on the United States. After seven years, the war goes on,
but never again has the battle returned to American soil. We are safer
than we were on September 11th. (Applause.) And we remain today as we have
been for 232 years: A free people, worthy of our freedom, and determined
to protect this great nation founded under God.</font></font></font></b>
</p><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#3333FF"><font size="+1">There
is no mystery behind the endurance and the success of American liberty.
It is because in every generation, from the Revolutionary period to this
very hour, brave Americans have stepped forward and served honorably in
the Armed Forces of the United States. Every one of them deserves the thanks
and the admiration of our entire country.</font></font></font></b>
</p><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#3333FF"><font size="+1">Military
service demands a special kind of sacrifice. The places where you live
and serve, the risk you face, the people you deal with every day -- all
of these are usually decided by someone else. For the time you spend in
uniform, the interests of the nation must always come first. And those
duties are shared by family members who make many sacrifices of their own,
face separation during deployments and sometimes bear extreme and permanent
loss.</font></font></font></b>
</p><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#3333FF"><font size="+1">Military
service brings rewards as well. There is the pride of developing one's
character and becoming a leader, serving a cause far greater than any self
interest and knowing that our nation's cause is the hope of the world.
Every man and woman who wears America's uniform is part of a long, unbroken
line of achievement and honor. No single military power in history has
done greater good, shown greater courage, liberated more people, or upheld
higher standards of decency and valor than the Armed Forces of the United
States of America.</font></font></font></b>
</p><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#3333FF"><font size="+1">That
is a legacy to be proud of, and those who contributed to it must never
be taken for granted. To honor our veterans, we must keep the promises
we have made to them. We must care for those who have been injured in the
service of our country. We must honor and remember those who have died.
And we must remember those whose fate is still undetermined. We fly the
POW flag on Veterans Day for a reason: This nation will not relent until
we have accounted for every last one of our missing Americans.</font></font></font></b>
</p><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#3333FF"><font size="+1">Not
long ago I read the recollections of a soldier whose National Guard unit
returned home after a lengthy tour of duty in Iraq. Delays and disruptions
made their journey far longer than expected. The young man and his comrades
finally landed at the airport in Bangor, Maine, 36 hours late; it was three
o'clock in the morning. Like everyone else on the aircraft, this soldier
was tired, hungry and frustrated. But, he said, "As I walked off the plane,
I was taken aback; in the small, dimly lit airport, a group of elderly
veterans were there waiting for us, lined up one by one to shake our hands.
Some were standing, others confined to wheelchairs, and all of them wore
their uniform hats. Their now-feeble right hands stiffened in salute, and
their left hands held coffee, snacks and cell phones for us. As I made
my way through the line, each man thanking me for my service, I choked
back tears. We later learned that this VFW group had waited for more than
a day in the airport for our arrival."</font></font></font></b>
</p><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#3333FF"><font size="+1">In
scenes like this, which have been repeated so many times in recent years,
we see the best in the character of America's veterans. There is a unique
fellowship among them, and they never forget the Americans who have followed
their example and now serve on active duty. They love their country. They
believe in its cause. And they know first hand that our world is a much
better place because of the power, the influence, and the values of the
United States.</font></font></font></b>
</p><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#3333FF"><font size="+1">Before
I close with another story, I want to recognize the contribution of the
Navy band here with us here today, and for their participation in these
ceremonies.</font></font></font></b>
</p><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#3333FF"><font size="+1">Recently,
at the White House, the following story was told. It happened in Italy,
in a time not too long after the end of the Second World War. A father
wanted to encourage his young son to do well in school. After the boy got
good grades, his dad took him on a journey to Rome. Near the end of their
vacation the father said, "Now we'll have the most important day. I'm going
to take you to a sacred place." He brought the boy to the military cemetery
at Anzio, the final resting place of nearly 8,000 American servicemen.</font></font></font></b>
</p><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#3333FF"><font size="+1">As
they stood there among the rows of crosses, the father turned to his son
and said, "Read those names and read those birth and death dates. These
are young people, young soldiers who crossed the ocean and came here, and
made the extreme last sacrifice to give you freedom and dignity. You owe
them everything that is good in your life today. You have to swear here
today that you will never, ever forget that you owe them everything you
have, and you will always be grateful to their country and to them for
what they gave you."</font></font></font></b>
</p><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#3333FF"><font size="+1">This
is a story told by Silvio Berlusconi, now the Prime Minister of Italy,
and the boy in the story is him. All his life he kept his promise to his
father, and last month at the White House, he expressed his nation's continuing
gratitude to the people of United States.</font></font></font></b>
</p><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#3333FF"><font size="+1">The
America that liberated Europe six decades ago is still an active, hopeful
presence in the affairs of mankind. In a world of so many perils, from
hunger and disease to political oppression to the spread of deadly technology,
America remains the best hope of those who suffer and live in fear. Our
cause is liberty, justice, and peace, and millions breathe free today because
of American soldiers who fought and sacrificed for that cause.</font></font></font></b>
</p><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#3333FF"><font size="+1">Many
of those heroes rest in places like Anzio and Arlington. Yet so many of
them are still with us as friends, as neighbours and colleagues. They are
America's veterans, and they are still the pride of our nation. They have
fought our wars, defended our shores and kept us free. May God keep us
ever grateful for their service.</font></font></font></b></p></center>
<p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#3333FF"><font size="+1">Thank
you very much.</font></font></font></b></p></td>
