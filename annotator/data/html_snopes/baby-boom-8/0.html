Every baby is special in their own way. That's why we have a formula for every baby. We also have a great personalized program called "Baby Steps"*.<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20000511223321/http://www.meadjohnson.ca/i1/p5b.htm"> Click here to

<p>Around the turn of the century, Mr. and Mrs. Johnson had a son. He was a healthy baby, but was unable to properly digest
breast milk. The assistance the Johnsons needed to help their son was not available as there were no baby formulas
at the time, until Edward Mead Johnson, Sr., a chemist, saw the need and began to develop an alternative
for breast milk patterned closely after breast milk. Since the beginning of the 20th Century,
Mead Johnson has pioneered research and development efforts in the field of nutrition. Today the company
provides quality assistance to mothers that enables them to make the best nutritional choices
for their babies. Our researchers continue to analyse mothers milk, from its nutrient composition 
to its immunological properties, and use that information to guide in the continual development
of what is known today as the Enfalac Family of Formulas.</p>
<font color="#001381" size="+1"><b>
ENFALAC FAMILY OF FORMULAS
</b></font>
<p>Both Enfalac &amp; Enfalac Iron Fortified provide high quality nutrition for your baby's growth
and development. Both are formulas that meet the nutritional needs of most babies. If you are
not breast-feeding, the Canadian Paediatric Society recommends the use of an iron-fortified 
formula for up to the first year of a baby's life.</p>
<p>
<font color="#001381" size="+1"><b>
ENFALAC AR</b></font></p>
<p> Spitting up after feedings may not be easy on your baby. Enfalac AR is
clinically proven to help babies who frequently spit up after feedings to
experience fewer feedings followed by spitting up, and less associated
discomfort than babies fed routine formula*. Enfalac AR is an iron
fortified, cow's milk-based formula, thickened with added rice
starch.  </p>
<font color="#001381" size="+1"><b>
ENFALAC LactoFree</b></font>
<p>Enfalac LactoFree is for babies with common feeding problems associated with lactose intolerance such
as mild diarrhea, gas, and general fussiness. It has the appearance and taste of regular infant 
formulas, but Enfalac LactoFree replaces the lactose with a different, easier to digest carbohydrate.</p>
<font color="#001381" size="+1"><b>
ENFALAC PROSOBEE SOY
</b></font>
<p>Enfalac ProSobee Soy is a soy-based formula that is used when an alternative to
milk-based formula is needed (i.e. galactosemia, vegetarian diet). Enfalac
ProSobee Soy is a lactose-free, sucrose-free, and iron-fortified formula.</p>
<font color="#001381" size="+1"><b>
ENFALAC NUTRAMIGEN HYPOALLERGENIC
</b></font>
<p>Enfalac Nutramigen is a hypoallergenic formula that provides relief of colic caused by milk
protein allergy. It's been specially designed for babies with food allergies or sensitive to whole proteins.
Enfalac Nutramigen is iron-fortified, contains a readily digestible form of protein (hydrolyzed
casein) and is an excellent alternative for babies with food allergies.</p>
<font color="#001381" size="+1"><b>
ENFALAC NEXT STEP
</b></font>
<p>Enfalac Next Step is a transitional formula for babies six months and older who are starting on solid food,
but aren't ready for cow's milk. Cow milk's low levels of iron - and high levels of protein make it 
hard for babies to properly digest. Iron is very important for your growing baby, and cow's milk 
can actually reduce iron absorbed from other foods in your baby's diet. That's why cow's milk shouldn't
be introduced into your baby's diet until after the first year. Enfalac Next Step has been specially formulated
to fulfill your baby's nutritional needs and is gentler on your baby's digestive system than cow's milk.
</p>
Mead Johnson Canada also offers a great personalized program called "Baby Steps" tailored to pregnant women.
