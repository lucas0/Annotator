<div class="mop-audience-reviews__review--comment clamp clamp-4 js-clamp" data-clamp="true">The season 10 renewal was one of the best things to happen to television in years. Despite the early cut-off, it's still quite good. It pays homage to '90s sitcoms while reinventing itself for the modern era. The characters seem like real people, with real lives, and real personalities. Exactly what made the original great.</div><div class="clamp-toggle-container"><a class="js-clamp-toggle clamp-toggle--show-more">Show More</a></div>

The most recent season gave a fair balance to conservatives and liberals when it came to comedy. sadly ABC killed the show and with the departure of Roseanne, the spin off called The Conners will not be the same. Without Roseanne, it will likely NOT be eorth watching.</div><div class="clamp-toggle-container"><a class="js-clamp-toggle clamp-toggle--show-more">Show More</a></div>

Time changes us, if we allow ourselves to grew up, and I feel like that's what happened with me. Roseanne was like a pair of ill-fitting shoes when I first "received" it, but now that I"m older, it fits. It's now on my list of TV series to record. Best food to eat while watching Roseanne --- sausage, mushroom, pepperoni, and garlic pizza, washed down with a Sapporo.</div><div class="clamp-toggle-container"><a class="js-clamp-toggle clamp-toggle--show-more">Show More</a></div>

Unconstrained by an official post -- though some say he still has a direct line to the White House -- he became free to peddle influence as a perceived kingmaker, turning his controversial brand of nationalism into a global movement. THE BRINK follows Bannon through the 2018 mid-term elections in the United States, shedding light on his efforts to mobilize and unify far-right parties in order to win seats in the May 2019 European Parliamentary elections. To maintain his power and influence, the former Goldman Sachs banker and media investor reinvents himself -- as he has many times before -- this time as the self-appointed leader of a global populist movement. Keen manipulator of the press and gifted self-promoter, Bannon continues to draw headlines and protests wherever he goes, feeding the powerful myth on which his survival relies.","boxOffice":null,"releaseDates":{"dvd":"2019-06-03T17:00:00-07:00","theater":"2019-07-11T17:00:00-07:00"},"runningTime":90,"posterImage":{"id":"m-13025287","thumborId":"v1.bTsxMzAyNTI4NztqOzE4MTUwOzEyMDA7NDA1MDs2MDAw","height":6000,"width":4050,"format":"JPG"},"windows":["in-theaters"],"officialUrl":"http:\u002F\u002Fwww.magpictures.com\u002Fthebrink\u002Fhome\u002F"},"mpaaRating":"NR","popularityOrder":3,"posterImageUri":"https:\u002F\u002Fresizing.flixster.com\u002FfigQU4_lIH5Nvv5GGakv49Z5AV4=\u002F130x0\u002Fv1.bTsxMzAyNTI4NztqOzE4MTUwOzEyMDA7NDA1MDs2MDAw","releaseDate":"Jul

(voice of Tom Hanks) has always been confident about his place in the world, and that his priority is taking care of his kid, whether that's Andy or Bonnie. So when Bonnie's beloved new craft-project-turned-toy, Forky (voice of Tony Hale), declares himself as \"trash\" and not a toy, Woody takes it upon himself to show Forky why he should embrace being a toy. But when Bonnie takes the whole gang on her family's road trip excursion, Woody ends up on an unexpected detour that includes a reunion with his long-lost friend Bo Peep (voice of Annie Potts). After years of being on her own, Bo's adventurous spirit and life on the road belie her delicate porcelain exterior. As Woody and Bo realize they're worlds apart when it comes to life as a toy, they soon come to find that's the least of their worries.","boxOffice":5543052,"releaseDates":{"dvd":null,"theater":"2019-06-20T17:00:00-07:00"},"runningTime":90,"posterImage":{"id":"m-13023916","thumborId":"v1.bTsxMzAyMzkxNjtqOzE4MTUwOzEyMDA7MTA4NjsxNjA5","height":1609,"width":1086,"format":"JPG"},"windows":["in-theaters"],"officialUrl":"https:\u002F\u002Fmovies.disney.com\u002Ftoy-story-4"},"mpaaRating":"G","popularityOrder":1,"posterImageUri":"https:\u002F\u002Fresizing.flixster.com\u002F56DQPEbtG34c-huiyvjhhqO1KYc=\u002F130x0\u002Fv1.bTsxMzAyMzkxNjtqOzE4MTUwOzEyMDA7MTA4NjsxNjA5","releaseDate":"Jun 21","releaseDates":{"dvd":null,"theater":"Jun 21"},"runTime":{"hours":1,"minutes":30},"title":"Toy Story 4","tomatometer":{"state":"certified_fresh","value":98,"ratingScore":98,"ratingLabel":"certified_fresh"},"boxOfficeToMillion":5.6,"type":"movie","vanity":"toy_story_4","year":2019},{"advisory":"for suggestive content and language","affiliates":null,"audienceSummary":null,"creationDate":"2019-02-12T01:49:14-08:00","criticSummary":{"id":"797119","type":"criticSummary","consensus":"\u003Cem\u003EYesterday\u003C\u002Fem\u003E may fall short of fab, but the end result is still a sweetly charming fantasy with an intriguing -- albeit somewhat under-explored -- premise.","topCritics":{"totalCount":32,"freshCount":18,"rottenCount":14,"dvdCount":0,"averageRating":6.33,"topCriticsTomatometer":{"value":56,"state":"rotten"}},"isEmbargoed":false,"allCritics":{"totalCount":284,"freshCount":178,"rottenCount":106,"dvdCount":0,"averageRating":6.4},"movieId":"771505240"},"detailPageUrl":"\u002Fm\u002Fyesterday_2019","embargoMessage":"Tomatometer Not Available...","genres":null,"id":"771505240","isEmbargoed":false,"lastModifiedDate":"2019-07-13T12:16:51-07:00","movieBoxOfficeInfo":null,"movieDetailsPageUrl":"\u002Fm\u002Fyesterday_2019","moviePersonnel":{"id":"771505240","type":"moviePersonnel","actors":[{"id":"774908524","type":"movieCast","characters":["Jack Malik"],"role":"ACT","person":{"id":"771921913","type":"person","mainImage":{"id":"n-1855082","thumborId":"v1.bjsxODU1MDgyO2o7MTgxNTY7MTIwMDs4ODU7MTE4MA","height":1180,"width":885,"format":"JPG"},"name":"Himesh Patel","bio":null,"vanity":"himesh_patel"}},{"id":"774908525","type":"movieCast","characters":["Ellie"],"role":"ACT","person":{"id":"771402472","type":"person","mainImage":{"id":"r-47916","thumborId":"v1.cjs0NzkxNjtqOzE4MTM1OzEyMDA7NzE1OzcxNQ","height":715,"width":715,"format":"JPG","caption":"Lily James"},"name":"Lily James","bio":null,"vanity":"lily_james"}},{"id":"774908527","type":"movieCast","characters":["Himself"],"role":"ACT","person":{"id":"771508793","type":"person","mainImage":{"id":"n-2281085","thumborId":"v1.bjsyMjgxMDg1O2o7MTgxNjE7MTIwMDsyMDEwOzI3Mjk","height":2729,"width":2010,"format":"JPG"},"name":"Ed Sheeran","bio":null,"vanity":"ed_sheeran"}},{"id":"774908526","type":"movieCast","characters":["Debra"],"role":"ACT","person":{"id":"770794871","type":"person","mainImage":{"id":"r-46991","thumborId":"v1.cjs0Njk5MTtqOzE4MTM1OzEyMDA7MjgwOzI1MA","height":250,"width":280,"format":"JPG","caption":"Kate McKinnon (Photo: Michael Loccisano \u002F Staff \u002F Getty Images)"},"name":"Kate McKinnon","bio":null,"vanity":"kate_mckinnon23310_2"}},{"id":"774948229","type":"movieCast","characters":["Rocky"],"role":"ACT","person":{"id":"771047091","type":"person","mainImage":{"id":"r-45183","thumborId":"v1.cjs0NTE4MztqOzE4MTM1OzEyMDA7MjMzOzIwOA","height":208,"width":233,"format":"JPG","caption":"Joel Fry"},"name":"Joel Fry","bio":null,"vanity":"joel_fry"}},{"id":"774948230","type":"movieCast","characters":["Himself"],"role":"ACT","person":{"id":"405587980","type":"person","mainImage":{"id":"r-48934","thumborId":"v1.cjs0ODkzNDtqOzE4MTM1OzEyMDA7NjgxOzY4MQ","height":681,"width":681,"format":"JPG","caption":"Host James Corden attends the 20th Annual Hollywood Film Awards on November 6, 2016 in Beverly Hills, California.

Still, you have to admire Rebecca Bunch (Rachel Bloom) for wanting to deal with the repercussions of the very long string of decisions - good, bad and alarmingly questionable - that she's made since she took flight from New York City and landed in West Covina three seasons ago. This year, Rebecca is in some ways like a baby chick that's about to tumble out of the nest, and in other ways she's that friend who is searching for enlightenment and kinda can't stop yammering about it.  \r\n\r\nAs always, Rebecca's actions have had unintended consequences for her West Covina friends -- Nathaniel (Scott Michael Foster) feels betrayed by her, Josh (Vincent Rodriguez III) is taken aback by her, and Darryl (Pete Gardner) is parenting her baby. Paula (Donna Lynne Champlin), Heather (Vella Lovell) and Valencia (Gabrielle Ruiz) remain staunchly by Rebecca's side but they are busy finding their own identities (as a law student, regional manager and kickass party planner, respectively.) Will everyone be content to stay in the nest with Rebecca? Or will they start to transcend the sunbaked, boba-strewn purgatory that is West Covina? The answer to these and other questions lies in this season of CRAZY EX-GIRLFRIEND as themes of redemption, recovery, responsibility, rebirth, renewal and reality and other words that begin with \"R\" will bring our ultimate \"R,\" Rebecca, to the satisfying end of this chapter of her life.

Around age 18, Roseanne Barr moved to a Colorado hippie commune where she met Bill Pentland. They married in 1973 and moved to Denver, where they struggled to support their three subsequent children. By the mid-'70s, Roseanne was working as both a cocktail waitress and a window dresser to help feed her family. Impressed by her quick, caustic wit and funny insights into women, men, and domestic life, friends and patrons suggested she take her stories on-stage at a local comedy club. It was on-stage where she honed her famous characterization of the dumpy, domineering, and earthy \"Domestic Goddess.\" Within a few years, Roseanne had become one of the most popular standup acts in Denver, and in 1983 she headed for Hollywood to further her career. She quickly landed a gig at The Comedy Store and then appeared on the ABC television special Funny. During rehearsal, she was spotted by a talent scout from The Tonight Show, who promptly booked her for an appearance. It was a great success. In 1988, her innovative and distinguished television sitcom, Roseanne, debuted on ABC and centered on the struggles of an overweight, domineering mother and her raucous, working-class family that is often on the brink of financial and personal crisis but always manages to somehow hang together. Roseanne and her brood were real people facing real problems that weren't always neatly solved in 30 minutes. The shows were often simultaneously poignant and hilarious; until its last two seasons, Roseanne topped the ratings, and won numerous awards and honors. During the course of the show, the many changes in Roseanne's personal life were reflected on the air. When she underwent breast-reduction surgery, her character did too. When she married Tom Arnold in 1990, he became a part of her show and she proudly billed herself as Roseanne Arnold. When the marriage broke up, he disappeared and she began billing herself only as Roseanne. She eventually married her bodyguard Ben Thomas and at the age of 43 had herself impregnated via in vitro fertilization. Her character, Roseanne Conner, also got pregnant. Even the plastic surgeries she has had on her face have received some treatment on the show, in this case via the opening credits, wherein her photographs from the past nine seasons reflect her change from the frowzy to the almost glamorous. Her series ended in May 1997. Though best known for her television work and live performances, Roseanne has also made periodic stabs at a movie career; she made her debut as a vengeful housewife opposite Meryl Streep in the comedy She-Devil (1989). The film received decidedly mixed reviews, and Roseanne's subsequent film appearances have been in cameos or small supporting roles. Over her career, Roseanne has received numerous awards, including an Emmy, several People's Choice Awards, Golden Globes, and an American Comedy Award. She was the fourth woman ever to become the star attraction at a Friar's Club celebrity roast. Back in the late '80s through the early '90s, Roseanne's tumultuous personal life, her often public and ill-timed abrasive nature coupled with her phenomenal popularity made her a favorite target of tabloid newspapers. Never one to shy away from such issues, she tells her own story in two books, the best-selling My Life As a Woman (1989) and My Lives (1994). She has also been frequently skewered by critics and wags who have difficulty accepting the fact that through sheer force of will, she has been able to overcome all obstacles to become a powerful and successful woman.","vanity":"roseanne"}},{"id":"13729902","type":"movieCast","characters":["Dan Conner"],"role":"Actor","person":{"id":"162655706","type":"person","mainImage":{"id":"r-47589","thumborId":"v1.cjs0NzU4OTtqOzE4MTM1OzEyMDA7MjgwOzI1MA","height":250,"width":280,"format":"JPG","url":"https:\u002F\u002Fresizing.flixster.com\u002Fyx2sG52K06lDTpmNXXkzaB7GJw8=\u002F100x120\u002Fv1.cjs0NzU4OTtqOzE4MTM1OzEyMDA7MjgwOzI1MA"},"name":"John Goodman","bio":"With a talent as large as his girth, John Goodman proved himself both a distinguished character actor and engaging leading man. A native of St. Louis, MO, Goodman went to Southwest Missouri State University on a football scholarship, but an injury compelled him to seek out a less strenuous major. He chose the university Drama Department, attending classes with such stars-to-be as Tess Harper and Kathleen Turner. Moving to New York in 1975, he supported himself by performing in children's and dinner theater, appearing in television commercials, and working as a bouncer. Goodman made his off-Broadway debut in a 1978 staging of A Midsummer Night's Dream, and, a year later, graduated to Broadway in Loose Ends. His best Broadway showing was as the drunken, brutish Pap in Big River, Roger Miller's 1985 musical adaptation of Huckleberry Finn. Goodman has occasionally played out and out villains or louts (The Big Easy, Barton Fink), but his essential likeability endeared him to audiences even when his onscreen behavior was at its least sympathetic. He contributed topnotch supporting appearances to such films as Everybody's All-American (1988), Sea of Love (1989), Stella (1989), and Arachnophobia (1990), and starred in such films as King Ralph (1991), The Babe (1992, as Babe Ruth), Born Yesterday (1993), and The Flintstones (1994, as Fred Flintstone). Goodman did some of his best work in Matinee (1992), in which he starred as William Castle-esque horror flick entrepreneur Lawrence Woolsey, and topped himself in The Big Lebowski (1998), playing a quirky security-store owner. He was seen the following year with Nicolas Cage and Ving Rhames in Martin Scorsese's Bringing out the Dead as an ambulance driver.Between 1988 and 1996, Goodman appeared as blue-collar patriarch Dan Conner on the hit TV sitcom Roseanne, a role that earned him four Emmy nominations and a Golden Globe award; his additional TV credits included two 1995 made-for-cable movies: the title role in Kingfish: A Story of Huey P. Long and Mitch in A Streetcar Named Desire, for which he earned another Emmy nomination. Announcing that the 1996-1997 season of Roseanne would be his last, Goodman limited himself to infrequent appearances on the series, his absences explained away as a by-product of a heart attack suffered by his character at the end of the previous season.After making his 10th appearance on Saturday Night Live (2000), Goodman could be seen playing a red-faced bible salesman in director Joel Coen's award winning O Brother, Where Art Thou (2000), and participated in Garry Shandling's film debut What Planet Are You From? (2000). He could be spotted playing an Oklahoma cop in The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle (2000), while Coyote Ugly (2000) and Storytelling (2001) found Goodman stepping back into the role of over-protective father. Interestingly enough, he donned hippie-gear to play a goth-chick's Leelee Sobieski dad in 2001's My First Mister. Though Goodman's status as an amiable big guy was well established by the early 2000's, he didn't actually appear on-screen for two of his most beloved roles. In The Emperor's New Groove (2000), Goodman lent his vocal talents for the part of Pacha, a poor farmer who taught a spoiled prince (David Spade) some valuable lessons about life, love, and the meaning of societal standing. Any film-going youngster will recognize Goodman's voice as Monsters, Inc.'s kind-hearted Sully, the furry blue monster who risked life and limb to return a little girl to her home; and who other than Goodman would have been appropriate to voice the part of Baloo, The Jungle Book 2's (2003) freewheeling bear? 2001's ill received One Night at McCool's features Goodman as one of three men lusting after Liv Tyler's character, while 2002's Dirty Deeds took John to Australia, where he played an American mafia-goon thoroughly ill suited to the intricacies of culture down under.

She and her sister and her older half-brother, Jonathon Gilbert, are the third generation of a showbiz family. Her grandfather, Harry Crane, was a writer for The Honeymooners, her grandmother, Julia Crane, was a former Miss Brooklyn and a dancer, and her mother is a producer and talent manager. Gilbert made her professional debut in a television commercial at age six, and from there appeared in the television series Tales of the Apple Dumpling Gang (1982). She then played a small role in the made-for-TV movie Calamity Jane, which starred Jane Alexander. Gilbert's career slowed down after that and she did not appear on television until 1988 when she appeared in Runaway Ralph as part of the ABC Weekend Special. As Darlene Connor in Roseanne, Gilbert believably played a cynical, smart-mouthed, but sensitive foil for Roseanne. Gilbert showed versatility as a confused Daddy's girl who is victimized by a calculating Drew Barrymore in Poison Ivy (1989) and as a Southern child with a dark secret who is befriended by a gentle black man in the well-wrought Sudie and Simpson (1990). Gilbert has been twice nominated for an Emmy and has won three Youth in Film Awards. During the last couple seasons of Roseanne, Gilbert began attending Yale University where she studied art and photography. She has also been an avid supporter for various environmental causes through her affiliation with Earth Communications Office (ECO).She stayed away from acting for the most part until 2007 when she began making occasional appearances on the hit sitcom The Big Bang Theory often playing opposite her former Roseanne co-star Johnny Galecki. In 2010, she created the talk show The Talk, a knockoff of The View, and serves as an executive producer and co-host of the series.","vanity":"sara_gilbert"}},{"id":"14024624","type":"movieCast","characters":["Jackie Harris"],"role":"Actor","person":{"id":"162679021","type":"person","mainImage":{"id":"r-43778","thumborId":"v1.cjs0Mzc3ODtqOzE4MTM1OzEyMDA7NDU1OzQwNQ","height":405,"width":455,"format":"JPG","url":"https:\u002F\u002Fresizing.flixster.com\u002FgbU8cdPOpBS1QP7hotYCHhF8Lu4=\u002F100x120\u002Fv1.cjs0Mzc3ODtqOzE4MTM1OzEyMDA7NDU1OzQwNQ"},"name":"Laurie Metcalf","bio":"Matriculating from Illinois State University, actress Laurie Metcalf was one of the charter members of Chicago's groundbreaking Steppenwolf Theatre troupe. She moved on to New York in the early '80s, winning a 1984 Theatre World Award and an Obie for her performance in Balm in Gilead. In films since 1985, the flexible Metcalf has been seen in director Susan Seidelman's Desperately Seeking Susan (1985) and Making Mr. Right (1987), and also in several other highly regarded productions, notably Uncle Buck (1989), JFK (1991), and Mistress (1992). Metcalf is best known to the TV-watching public for her Emmy-winning portrayal of Roseanne Conner's police-officer sister, Jackie Harris, on the long-running sitcom Roseanne. In 1997, following the demise of her television series, Metcalf turned in a deliciously over-the-top performance as the tightly wound aspiring reporter Debbie Salt in Scream 2. In the decades to come, Metcalfe would find success on shows like Norm and The Big Bang Theory, as well as movies like Stop-Loss Georgia Rule.

Chalke continued to play Becky for two seasons until Goranson returned, but the two actresses took turns playing the character throughout the season. Goranson left again before the show's ninth and final season, and Chalke resumed the role full-time.Following the end of Roseanne, Chalke took on a role in the Canadian series Nothing Too Good for a Cowboy. While that show only lasted nine episodes, it would only be a couple more years before the actress found herself on another hit series. In 2001, she was cast as Elliot Reid, the female lead opposite Zach Braff on the cult hit NBC medical comedy Scrubs. The massively successful show would run until 2010, earning Chalke legions of fans.In addition to her series television work, Chalke has acted in a number of made-for-TV movies and small independent films over the years. In 2007 she had her first role in a high-profile Hollywood movie with a supporting turn alongside Jon Heder and Diane Keaton in the comedy Mama's Boy. She would also find continued success on the small screen, with starring roles on shows like Mad Love, a recurring gig on Cougar Town and guest spots on shows like Grey's Anatomy and Angie Tribeca.","vanity":"sarah_chalke"}}],"startDate":"Mar 27, 2018","startYear":2018,"tomatometer":{"numReviews":78,"freshCount":55,"rottenCount":23,"tomatometer":71,"averageScore":6.72,"episodesWithScore":null,"episodeAvgScore":null,"consensus":"\u003Cem\u003ERoseanne\u003C\u002Fem\u003E's return finds the show's classic format, original cast, and timely humor intact, even if the latest batch of episodes suffers from sporadically uneven execution.","state":"fresh","certifiedFresh":true},"topTomatometer":{"id":"tt-25290","type":"topTomatometer","rottenCount":14,"tomatometer":"62","numReviews":37,"averageScore":"6.25","consensus":null,"isEmbargoed":false,"episodeAvgScore":null,"state":"fresh","category":"tvSeason","certifiedFresh":"false","freshCount":23,"tvSeriesId":"7603","episodesWithScore":null},"tvEpisodes":[{"id":"927378","type":"tvEpisode","embargoMessage":"Tomatometer Not Available...","tomatometer":{"numReviews":1,"freshCount":1,"rottenCount":0,"tomatometer":null,"averageScore":0,"episodesWithScore":null,"episodeAvgScore":null,"consensus":null,"state":"NA","certifiedFresh":false},"airDate":"Mar 27, 2018","heroImage":null,"synopsis":"In the premiere of the sitcom's reboot, Roseanne and Dan adjust to living under the same roof with Darlene and her two children, Harris and Mark, when Darlene loses her job.

Around age 18, Roseanne Barr moved to a Colorado hippie commune where she met Bill Pentland. They married in 1973 and moved to Denver, where they struggled to support their three subsequent children. By the mid-'70s, Roseanne was working as both a cocktail waitress and a window dresser to help feed her family. Impressed by her quick, caustic wit and funny insights into women, men, and domestic life, friends and patrons suggested she take her stories on-stage at a local comedy club. It was on-stage where she honed her famous characterization of the dumpy, domineering, and earthy \"Domestic Goddess.\" Within a few years, Roseanne had become one of the most popular standup acts in Denver, and in 1983 she headed for Hollywood to further her career. She quickly landed a gig at The Comedy Store and then appeared on the ABC television special Funny. During rehearsal, she was spotted by a talent scout from The Tonight Show, who promptly booked her for an appearance. It was a great success. In 1988, her innovative and distinguished television sitcom, Roseanne, debuted on ABC and centered on the struggles of an overweight, domineering mother and her raucous, working-class family that is often on the brink of financial and personal crisis but always manages to somehow hang together. Roseanne and her brood were real people facing real problems that weren't always neatly solved in 30 minutes. The shows were often simultaneously poignant and hilarious; until its last two seasons, Roseanne topped the ratings, and won numerous awards and honors. During the course of the show, the many changes in Roseanne's personal life were reflected on the air. When she underwent breast-reduction surgery, her character did too. When she married Tom Arnold in 1990, he became a part of her show and she proudly billed herself as Roseanne Arnold. When the marriage broke up, he disappeared and she began billing herself only as Roseanne. She eventually married her bodyguard Ben Thomas and at the age of 43 had herself impregnated via in vitro fertilization. Her character, Roseanne Conner, also got pregnant. Even the plastic surgeries she has had on her face have received some treatment on the show, in this case via the opening credits, wherein her photographs from the past nine seasons reflect her change from the frowzy to the almost glamorous. Her series ended in May 1997. Though best known for her television work and live performances, Roseanne has also made periodic stabs at a movie career; she made her debut as a vengeful housewife opposite Meryl Streep in the comedy She-Devil (1989). The film received decidedly mixed reviews, and Roseanne's subsequent film appearances have been in cameos or small supporting roles. Over her career, Roseanne has received numerous awards, including an Emmy, several People's Choice Awards, Golden Globes, and an American Comedy Award. She was the fourth woman ever to become the star attraction at a Friar's Club celebrity roast. Back in the late '80s through the early '90s, Roseanne's tumultuous personal life, her often public and ill-timed abrasive nature coupled with her phenomenal popularity made her a favorite target of tabloid newspapers. Never one to shy away from such issues, she tells her own story in two books, the best-selling My Life As a Woman (1989) and My Lives (1994). She has also been frequently skewered by critics and wags who have difficulty accepting the fact that through sheer force of will, she has been able to overcome all obstacles to become a powerful and successful woman.","vanity":"roseanne"}},{"id":"13729902","type":"movieCast","characters":["Dan Conner"],"role":"Actor","person":{"id":"162655706","type":"person","mainImage":{"id":"r-47589","thumborId":"v1.cjs0NzU4OTtqOzE4MTM1OzEyMDA7MjgwOzI1MA","height":250,"width":280,"format":"JPG","url":"https:\u002F\u002Fresizing.flixster.com\u002Fyx2sG52K06lDTpmNXXkzaB7GJw8=\u002F100x120\u002Fv1.cjs0NzU4OTtqOzE4MTM1OzEyMDA7MjgwOzI1MA"},"name":"John Goodman","bio":"With a talent as large as his girth, John Goodman proved himself both a distinguished character actor and engaging leading man. A native of St. Louis, MO, Goodman went to Southwest Missouri State University on a football scholarship, but an injury compelled him to seek out a less strenuous major. He chose the university Drama Department, attending classes with such stars-to-be as Tess Harper and Kathleen Turner. Moving to New York in 1975, he supported himself by performing in children's and dinner theater, appearing in television commercials, and working as a bouncer. Goodman made his off-Broadway debut in a 1978 staging of A Midsummer Night's Dream, and, a year later, graduated to Broadway in Loose Ends. His best Broadway showing was as the drunken, brutish Pap in Big River, Roger Miller's 1985 musical adaptation of Huckleberry Finn. Goodman has occasionally played out and out villains or louts (The Big Easy, Barton Fink), but his essential likeability endeared him to audiences even when his onscreen behavior was at its least sympathetic. He contributed topnotch supporting appearances to such films as Everybody's All-American (1988), Sea of Love (1989), Stella (1989), and Arachnophobia (1990), and starred in such films as King Ralph (1991), The Babe (1992, as Babe Ruth), Born Yesterday (1993), and The Flintstones (1994, as Fred Flintstone). Goodman did some of his best work in Matinee (1992), in which he starred as William Castle-esque horror flick entrepreneur Lawrence Woolsey, and topped himself in The Big Lebowski (1998), playing a quirky security-store owner. He was seen the following year with Nicolas Cage and Ving Rhames in Martin Scorsese's Bringing out the Dead as an ambulance driver.Between 1988 and 1996, Goodman appeared as blue-collar patriarch Dan Conner on the hit TV sitcom Roseanne, a role that earned him four Emmy nominations and a Golden Globe award; his additional TV credits included two 1995 made-for-cable movies: the title role in Kingfish: A Story of Huey P. Long and Mitch in A Streetcar Named Desire, for which he earned another Emmy nomination. Announcing that the 1996-1997 season of Roseanne would be his last, Goodman limited himself to infrequent appearances on the series, his absences explained away as a by-product of a heart attack suffered by his character at the end of the previous season.After making his 10th appearance on Saturday Night Live (2000), Goodman could be seen playing a red-faced bible salesman in director Joel Coen's award winning O Brother, Where Art Thou (2000), and participated in Garry Shandling's film debut What Planet Are You From? (2000). He could be spotted playing an Oklahoma cop in The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle (2000), while Coyote Ugly (2000) and Storytelling (2001) found Goodman stepping back into the role of over-protective father. Interestingly enough, he donned hippie-gear to play a goth-chick's Leelee Sobieski dad in 2001's My First Mister. Though Goodman's status as an amiable big guy was well established by the early 2000's, he didn't actually appear on-screen for two of his most beloved roles. In The Emperor's New Groove (2000), Goodman lent his vocal talents for the part of Pacha, a poor farmer who taught a spoiled prince (David Spade) some valuable lessons about life, love, and the meaning of societal standing. Any film-going youngster will recognize Goodman's voice as Monsters, Inc.'s kind-hearted Sully, the furry blue monster who risked life and limb to return a little girl to her home; and who other than Goodman would have been appropriate to voice the part of Baloo, The Jungle Book 2's (2003) freewheeling bear? 2001's ill received One Night at McCool's features Goodman as one of three men lusting after Liv Tyler's character, while 2002's Dirty Deeds took John to Australia, where he played an American mafia-goon thoroughly ill suited to the intricacies of culture down under.

She and her sister and her older half-brother, Jonathon Gilbert, are the third generation of a showbiz family. Her grandfather, Harry Crane, was a writer for The Honeymooners, her grandmother, Julia Crane, was a former Miss Brooklyn and a dancer, and her mother is a producer and talent manager. Gilbert made her professional debut in a television commercial at age six, and from there appeared in the television series Tales of the Apple Dumpling Gang (1982). She then played a small role in the made-for-TV movie Calamity Jane, which starred Jane Alexander. Gilbert's career slowed down after that and she did not appear on television until 1988 when she appeared in Runaway Ralph as part of the ABC Weekend Special. As Darlene Connor in Roseanne, Gilbert believably played a cynical, smart-mouthed, but sensitive foil for Roseanne. Gilbert showed versatility as a confused Daddy's girl who is victimized by a calculating Drew Barrymore in Poison Ivy (1989) and as a Southern child with a dark secret who is befriended by a gentle black man in the well-wrought Sudie and Simpson (1990). Gilbert has been twice nominated for an Emmy and has won three Youth in Film Awards. During the last couple seasons of Roseanne, Gilbert began attending Yale University where she studied art and photography. She has also been an avid supporter for various environmental causes through her affiliation with Earth Communications Office (ECO).She stayed away from acting for the most part until 2007 when she began making occasional appearances on the hit sitcom The Big Bang Theory often playing opposite her former Roseanne co-star Johnny Galecki. In 2010, she created the talk show The Talk, a knockoff of The View, and serves as an executive producer and co-host of the series.","vanity":"sara_gilbert"}},{"id":"14024624","type":"movieCast","characters":["Jackie Harris"],"role":"Actor","person":{"id":"162679021","type":"person","mainImage":{"id":"r-43778","thumborId":"v1.cjs0Mzc3ODtqOzE4MTM1OzEyMDA7NDU1OzQwNQ","height":405,"width":455,"format":"JPG","url":"https:\u002F\u002Fresizing.flixster.com\u002FgbU8cdPOpBS1QP7hotYCHhF8Lu4=\u002F100x120\u002Fv1.cjs0Mzc3ODtqOzE4MTM1OzEyMDA7NDU1OzQwNQ"},"name":"Laurie Metcalf","bio":"Matriculating from Illinois State University, actress Laurie Metcalf was one of the charter members of Chicago's groundbreaking Steppenwolf Theatre troupe. She moved on to New York in the early '80s, winning a 1984 Theatre World Award and an Obie for her performance in Balm in Gilead. In films since 1985, the flexible Metcalf has been seen in director Susan Seidelman's Desperately Seeking Susan (1985) and Making Mr. Right (1987), and also in several other highly regarded productions, notably Uncle Buck (1989), JFK (1991), and Mistress (1992). Metcalf is best known to the TV-watching public for her Emmy-winning portrayal of Roseanne Conner's police-officer sister, Jackie Harris, on the long-running sitcom Roseanne. In 1997, following the demise of her television series, Metcalf turned in a deliciously over-the-top performance as the tightly wound aspiring reporter Debbie Salt in Scream 2.

Chalke continued to play Becky for two seasons until Goranson returned, but the two actresses took turns playing the character throughout the season. Goranson left again before the show's ninth and final season, and Chalke resumed the role full-time.Following the end of Roseanne, Chalke took on a role in the Canadian series Nothing Too Good for a Cowboy. While that show only lasted nine episodes, it would only be a couple more years before the actress found herself on another hit series. In 2001, she was cast as Elliot Reid, the female lead opposite Zach Braff on the cult hit NBC medical comedy Scrubs. The massively successful show would run until 2010, earning Chalke legions of fans.In addition to her series television work, Chalke has acted in a number of made-for-TV movies and small independent films over the years. In 2007 she had her first role in a high-profile Hollywood movie with a supporting turn alongside Jon Heder and Diane Keaton in the comedy Mama's Boy. She would also find continued success on the small screen, with starring roles on shows like Mad Love, a recurring gig on Cougar Town and guest spots on shows like Grey's Anatomy and Angie Tribeca.","vanity":"sarah_chalke"}}],"directors":[],"screenwriters":[],"executiveProducers":[{"id":"14024631","type":"movieCast","characters":[],"role":"Executive Producer","person":{"id":"563560166","type":"person","mainImage":{"id":"r-49950","thumborId":"v1.cjs0OTk1MDtqOzE4MTM1OzEyMDA7MTcxMzsyNTcw","height":2570,"width":1713,"format":"JPG"},"name":"Roseanne Barr","bio":"Brash and brassy comedian Roseanne is a one-of-a-kind talent who during her career has undergone many substantial changes that have transformed her from trailer-trash queen to one of the most powerful women in Hollywood. Around age 18, Roseanne Barr moved to a Colorado hippie commune where she met Bill Pentland. They married in 1973 and moved to Denver, where they struggled to support their three subsequent children. By the mid-'70s, Roseanne was working as both a cocktail waitress and a window dresser to help feed her family. Impressed by her quick, caustic wit and funny insights into women, men, and domestic life, friends and patrons suggested she take her stories on-stage at a local comedy club. It was on-stage where she honed her famous characterization of the dumpy, domineering, and earthy \"Domestic Goddess.\" Within a few years, Roseanne had become one of the most popular standup acts in Denver, and in 1983 she headed for Hollywood to further her career. She quickly landed a gig at The Comedy Store and then appeared on the ABC television special Funny. During rehearsal, she was spotted by a talent scout from The Tonight Show, who promptly booked her for an appearance. It was a great success. In 1988, her innovative and distinguished television sitcom, Roseanne, debuted on ABC and centered on the struggles of an overweight, domineering mother and her raucous, working-class family that is often on the brink of financial and personal crisis but always manages to somehow hang together. Roseanne and her brood were real people facing real problems that weren't always neatly solved in 30 minutes. The shows were often simultaneously poignant and hilarious; until its last two seasons, Roseanne topped the ratings, and won numerous awards and honors. During the course of the show, the many changes in Roseanne's personal life were reflected on the air. When she underwent breast-reduction surgery, her character did too. When she married Tom Arnold in 1990, he became a part of her show and she proudly billed herself as Roseanne Arnold. When the marriage broke up, he disappeared and she began billing herself only as Roseanne. She eventually married her bodyguard Ben Thomas and at the age of 43 had herself impregnated via in vitro fertilization. Her character, Roseanne Conner, also got pregnant. Even the plastic surgeries she has had on her face have received some treatment on the show, in this case via the opening credits, wherein her photographs from the past nine seasons reflect her change from the frowzy to the almost glamorous. Her series ended in May 1997. Though best known for her television work and live performances, Roseanne has also made periodic stabs at a movie career; she made her debut as a vengeful housewife opposite Meryl Streep in the comedy She-Devil (1989). The film received decidedly mixed reviews, and Roseanne's subsequent film appearances have been in cameos or small supporting roles. Over her career, Roseanne has received numerous awards, including an Emmy, several People's Choice Awards, Golden Globes, and an American Comedy Award. She was the fourth woman ever to become the star attraction at a Friar's Club celebrity roast. Back in the late '80s through the early '90s, Roseanne's tumultuous personal life, her often public and ill-timed abrasive nature coupled with her phenomenal popularity made her a favorite target of tabloid newspapers. Never one to shy away from such issues, she tells her own story in two books, the best-selling My Life As a Woman (1989) and My Lives (1994). She has also been frequently skewered by critics and wags who have difficulty accepting the fact that through sheer force of will, she has been able to overcome all obstacles to become a powerful and successful woman.","vanity":"roseanne"}},{"id":"14024632","type":"movieCast","characters":[],"role":"Executive Producer","person":{"id":"162707375","type":"person","mainImage":{"id":"r-49684","thumborId":"v1.cjs0OTY4NDtqOzE4MTM1OzEyMDA7MjAwMDszMDAw","height":3000,"width":2000,"format":"JPG"},"name":"Sara Gilbert","bio":"Like her older half-sister Melissa (Little House on the Prairie), actress Sara Gilbert grew up on a television series, in this case, the long-running ABC sitcom Roseanne (1988-1997). She and her sister and her older half-brother, Jonathon Gilbert, are the third generation of a showbiz family. Her grandfather, Harry Crane, was a writer for The Honeymooners, her grandmother, Julia Crane, was a former Miss Brooklyn and a dancer, and her mother is a producer and talent manager. Gilbert made her professional debut in a television commercial at age six, and from there appeared in the television series Tales of the Apple Dumpling Gang (1982). She then played a small role in the made-for-TV movie Calamity Jane, which starred Jane Alexander. Gilbert's career slowed down after that and she did not appear on television until 1988 when she appeared in Runaway Ralph as part of the ABC Weekend Special. As Darlene Connor in Roseanne, Gilbert believably played a cynical, smart-mouthed, but sensitive foil for Roseanne. Gilbert showed versatility as a confused Daddy's girl who is victimized by a calculating Drew Barrymore in Poison Ivy (1989) and as a Southern child with a dark secret who is befriended by a gentle black man in the well-wrought Sudie and Simpson (1990). Gilbert has been twice nominated for an Emmy and has won three Youth in Film Awards. During the last couple seasons of Roseanne, Gilbert began attending Yale University where she studied art and photography. She has also been an avid supporter for various environmental causes through her affiliation with Earth Communications Office (ECO).She stayed away from acting for the most part until 2007 when she began making occasional appearances on the hit sitcom The Big Bang Theory often playing opposite her former Roseanne co-star Johnny Galecki. In 2010, she created the talk show The Talk, a knockoff of The View, and serves as an executive producer and co-host of the series.","vanity":"sara_gilbert"}},{"id":"14024633","type":"movieCast","characters":[],"role":"Executive Producer","person":{"id":"770670483","type":"person","mainImage":null,"name":"Tom Werner","bio":"","vanity":"tom_werner"}},{"id":"14024634","type":"movieCast","characters":[],"role":"Executive Producer","person":{"id":"771166201","type":"person","mainImage":null,"name":"Bruce Helford","bio":"","vanity":"bruce_helford"}},{"id":"14024635","type":"movieCast","characters":[],"role":"Executive Producer","person":{"id":"770706239","type":"person","mainImage":{"id":"r-45477","thumborId":"v1.cjs0NTQ3NztqOzE4MTM1OzEyMDA7NDM0OzM4Nw","height":387,"width":434,"format":"JPG"},"name":"Whitney Cummings","bio":"Comedian, actress and writer Whitney Cummings first caught audience's attention as a cast member on the reality prank series Punk'd.
