<hr class="intro_hr"/><h3 class="SubHead1 subhead_main">Introduction<a class="anchor" name="introduction"></a></h3>
<p class="Document">The Double Jeopardy Clause provides three types of
protection: “[i]t protects against a second prosecution for the same offense
after acquittal. It protects against a second prosecution for the same offense
after conviction. And it protects against multiple punishments for the same
offense.”<a class="anchor" name="_ftnref1"></a><a class="footnote_link" href="https://www.yalelawjournal.org/#_ftnref1" id="footnote_number_1">1</a>
While the protections afforded by the Clause are, in a sense, quite broad, the
Clause carries with it a major exception: the dual sovereignty doctrine. The
Supreme Court explained this doctrine in <i>Heath
v. Alabama</i>: </p>
<p class="block_quote">The dual sovereignty doctrine is founded on the
common-law conception of crime as an offense against the sovereignty of the
government. When a defendant in a single act violates the “peace and dignity”
of two sovereigns by breaking the laws of each, he has committed two distinct
“offences.” As the Court explained in <i>Moore v. Illinois</i>, “[a]n offence,
in its legal signification, means the transgression of a law.” Consequently,
when the same act transgresses the laws of two sovereigns, “it cannot be truly
averred that the offender has been twice punished for the same offence; but
only that by one act he has committed two offences, for each of which he is
justly punishable.”<a class="anchor" name="_ftnref2"></a><a class="footnote_link" href="https://www.yalelawjournal.org/#_ftnref2" id="footnote_number_2">2</a></p>
<p class="Document"><span>Under
the dual sovereignty doctrine, so long as two offenses are defined by different
jurisdictions,</span><a class="anchor" name="_ftnref3"></a><a class="footnote_link" href="https://www.yalelawjournal.org/#_ftnref3" id="footnote_number_3">3</a><span> they cannot constitute the “same offense.”
This is true even if the offenses contain identical elements and even if the
underlying statutes contain identical language. The result is that the Double
Jeopardy Clause does not apply in a multi-sovereign context. For example, a
defendant who commits a kidnapping across two states can be charged, convicted,
and punished three times—once by each state and once by the federal
government.</span></p>
<p class="Document"><span>The dual sovereignty
doctrine has been the subject of substantial scholarly criticism. Most
opponents believe the doctrine is fundamentally unfair to defendants, that it
is directly at odds with the values underlying the Double Jeopardy Clause, and
that it lacks historical and constitutional legitimacy. As a result, scholars
have argued that the doctrine should be abolished,</span><a name="_Ref377874647"></a><a class="anchor" name="_ftnref4"></a><a class="footnote_link" href="https://www.yalelawjournal.org/#_ftnref4" id="footnote_number_4">4</a><span>
replaced,</span><a class="anchor" name="_ftnref5"></a><a class="footnote_link" href="https://www.yalelawjournal.org/#_ftnref5" id="footnote_number_5">5</a><span> or otherwise modified</span><a name="_Ref377960987"></a><a class="anchor" name="_ftnref6"></a><a class="footnote_link" href="https://www.yalelawjournal.org/#_ftnref6" id="footnote_number_6">6</a><span>
to protect rights and ensure fairness. The problem with most of these
criticisms is that they focus too much on the Double Jeopardy Clause and the
dual sovereignty doctrine itself, to the exclusion of other provisions of the
Constitution that can provide a solution.</span></p>
<p class="Document"><span>In this Note, I will
look to the Due Process Clause to show that, notwithstanding the dual
sovereignty doctrine, a jurisdiction should not have the unfettered ability to
punish a defendant after the defendant has already received punishment for the
same crime from another jurisdiction. Specifically, I will argue that when the
interests of </span>one sovereign state are fully or partially vindicated by
another state, the sovereign should be able to impart only as much additional
punishment as is necessary to fully vindicate its interests. Any further
punishment would violate a defendant’s due process rights.</p>
<p class="Document">This Note has four parts. In Part I,
I will explore the constitutional protection from multiple punishments for the
same offense. I will show how the protection against multiple punishments is
rooted not just in the Double Jeopardy Clause, but also in the Due Process
Clause.<a name="_Ref377958260"></a><a class="anchor" name="_ftnref7"></a><a class="footnote_link" href="https://www.yalelawjournal.org/#_ftnref7" id="footnote_number_7">7</a><span>
In Part II, I will show how the protection from multiple punishments can limit
the punishment a sovereign can impose on a defendant who has already received
punishment for the same offense. In Part III, I consider how the protection
from multiple punishments can impact the plea bargaining process. Finally, in
Part IV, I will introduce and respond to some of the objections that can be
levied against my proposal.</span></p>
<h3 class="SubHead1 subhead_main">I. the
due process protection from multiple punishments<a class="anchor" name="i-the-due-process-protection-from-multiple-punishments"></a></h3>
<p class="Document">While the Supreme Court has long recognized that the Double
Jeopardy Clause protects individuals from multiple punishments for the same
offense, the Court’s reasoning in multiple-punishment cases suggests that the
protection can be found not only in the Double Jeopardy Clause, but also in the
Due Process Clause. In this Part, I will show how each of these sources
independently provide protection from multiple punishments. In doing so, I will
show how the Due Process Clause can protect defendants from multiple
punishments even when the Double Jeopardy Clause does not.</p>
<h3 class="SubHead1">A. Origins
of the Protection<a class="anchor" name="a-origins-of-the-protection"></a></h3>
<p class="Document">The protection from multiple punishments can be traced back
to <i>Ex Parte Lange</i>.<a class="anchor" name="_ftnref8"></a><a class="footnote_link" href="https://www.yalelawjournal.org/#_ftnref8" id="footnote_number_8">8</a>
In that case, a defendant was charged under a statute that authorized one of
two punishments: a fine, not to exceed $200, or imprisonment for up to a year.<a class="anchor" name="_ftnref9"></a><a class="footnote_link" href="https://www.yalelawjournal.org/#_ftnref9" id="footnote_number_9">9</a>
Despite the fact that the statute authorized only one of these sentences, the
trial court imposed both.<a class="anchor" name="_ftnref10"></a><a class="footnote_link" href="https://www.yalelawjournal.org/#_ftnref10" id="footnote_number_10">10</a> In an opinion
written by Justice Miller, the Supreme Court rejected the punishment. Justice
Miller explained his decision using two rationales. First, he argued that the
sentence at issue in the case violated the Double Jeopardy Clause and the
common law understanding of double jeopardy.<a class="anchor" name="_ftnref11"></a><a class="footnote_link" href="https://www.yalelawjournal.org/#_ftnref11" id="footnote_number_11">11</a>
Second, he found that the sentence violated Lange’s due process right to
receive a punishment authorized by Congress. Specifically, he explained that
the punishment should be void “because [the judge] had no power to render such
a judgment.”<a class="anchor" name="_ftnref12"></a><a class="footnote_link" href="https://www.yalelawjournal.org/#_ftnref12" id="footnote_number_12">12</a></p>
<p class="Document">In subsequent cases, the Supreme Court extended both of these
rationales. For example, in <i>North
Carolina v. Pearce</i>, the Court cited <i>Lange</i>’s
reference to common law double jeopardy principles when it concluded that a
defendant should receive credit for time served when he is resentenced
following a successful appeal.<a class="anchor" name="_ftnref13"></a><a class="footnote_link" href="https://www.yalelawjournal.org/#_ftnref13" id="footnote_number_13">13</a>Similarly, in <i>Whalen v. United States</i>, the Court extended the due process
justification when it found that “the dispositive question” when it comes to
multiple punishments is whether the sentence at issue is authorized by the
legislature.<a class="anchor" name="_ftnref14"></a><a class="footnote_link" href="https://www.yalelawjournal.org/#_ftnref14" id="footnote_number_14">14</a>
According to the <i>Whalen </i>court: “If a
federal court exceeds its own authority by imposing multiple punishments not
authorized by Congress, it violates not only the specific guarantee against
double jeopardy, but also the constitutional principle of separation of powers
. . . .”<a class="anchor" name="_ftnref15"></a><a class="footnote_link" href="https://www.yalelawjournal.org/#_ftnref15" id="footnote_number_15">15</a>
</p>
<p class="Document">While the Supreme Court has extended both due process and
double jeopardy rationales, the Court has, unfortunately, conflated the two,
making it difficult to see how the due process protection differs from the
double jeopardy protection.<a name="_Ref377876576"></a><a class="anchor" name="_ftnref16"></a><a class="footnote_link" href="https://www.yalelawjournal.org/#_ftnref16" id="footnote_number_16">16</a> In <i>Ohio v. Johnson</i>, for example, the Court referred to the double
jeopardy rationale while applying due process reasoning: </p>
<p class="block_quote">[T]he final component of double
jeopardy—protection against cumulative punishments—is designed to
ensure that the sentencing discretion is confined to the limits established by
the legislature. Because the substantive power to prescribe crimes and
determine punishments is vested with the legislature, the question under the
Double Jeopardy Clause whether punishments are “multiple” is essentially one of
legislative intent.<a class="anchor" name="_ftnref17"></a><a class="footnote_link" href="https://www.yalelawjournal.org/#_ftnref17" id="footnote_number_17">17</a></p>
<p class="Document">Somehow, the double jeopardy
protection from multiple punishments, if one ever really existed,<a name="_Ref271185595"></a><a class="anchor" name="_ftnref18"></a><a class="footnote_link" href="https://www.yalelawjournal.org/#_ftnref18" id="footnote_number_18">18</a> morphed into the due process
protection. Indeed, one need only replace the phrase “double jeopardy” with
“due process” in the quote above to see that the Court’s reasoning in <i>Johnson</i> is, to put it mildly, confused.<a class="anchor" name="_ftnref19"></a><a class="footnote_link" href="https://www.yalelawjournal.org/#_ftnref19" id="footnote_number_19">19</a>
Unfortunately, <i>Ohio v. Johnson </i>is not
an isolated incident. The Court’s conflation of double jeopardy and due process
protections is rather extensive.<a name="_Ref273377353"></a><a class="anchor" name="_ftnref20"></a><a class="footnote_link" href="https://www.yalelawjournal.org/#_ftnref20" id="footnote_number_20">20</a> As Justice Scalia once recognized,
the dispositions of the Court’s double jeopardy cases is “entirely consistent
with the proposition that the restriction [on multiple punishments] derive[s]
exclusively from the due process requirement of legislative authorization.”<a class="anchor" name="_ftnref21"></a><a class="footnote_link" href="https://www.yalelawjournal.org/#_ftnref21" id="footnote_number_21">21</a>
As a consequence, there are only a handful of cases following <i>Lange </i>that properly reference the Due
Process Clause as a protection from multiple punishments.<a name="_Ref258432397"></a><a class="anchor" name="_ftnref22"></a><a class="footnote_link" href="https://www.yalelawjournal.org/#_ftnref22" id="footnote_number_22">22</a> By and large, it is a forgotten
right. </p>
<h3 class="SubHead1">B. Scope
and Significance of the Problem<a class="anchor" name="b-scope-and-significance-of-the-problem"></a></h3>
<p class="Document">It is worth taking a moment at the
outset to consider why this is an interesting problem. The fact that a
protection from multiple punishments resides in the Due Process Clause means
that defendants should receive this protection even when the Double Jeopardy
Clause does not apply. More specifically, it means that defendants should have
protection from multiple punishments in a dual-sovereign context.<a class="anchor" name="_ftnref23"></a><a class="footnote_link" href="https://www.yalelawjournal.org/#_ftnref23" id="footnote_number_23">23</a></p>
<p class="Document"><span>The protection from multiple punishments can be understood
in two parts: first, as a protection from multiple punishments imposed “at a
single criminal trial,” and second, as a protection from “attempts to secure
additional punishment after a prior conviction and sentence.”<a class="anchor" name="_ftnref24"></a><a class="footnote_link" href="https://www.yalelawjournal.org/#_ftnref24" id="footnote_number_24">24</a><span><span>
For the most part, courts have focused only on the former,</span></span><a class="anchor" name="_ftnref25"></a><a class="footnote_link" href="https://www.yalelawjournal.org/#_ftnref25" id="footnote_number_25">25</a><span><span> to
the exclusion of the latter.</span></span><a class="anchor" name="_ftnref26"></a><a class="footnote_link" href="https://www.yalelawjournal.org/#_ftnref26" id="footnote_number_26">26</a><span><span> On
closer inspection, this is not surprising. If the government cannot <i>prosecute</i> a defendant multiple times for
the same offense, then it follows immediately that the government cannot <i>punish </i>a defendant across multiple
prosecutions for the same offense. After all, if a defendant cannot be tried,
he cannot be punished. Viewed in this light, the traditional double jeopardy
protection from multiple prosecutions supersedes much of the protection from
multiple punishments. The result is that courts have not had much need to
explore the contours of the protection from multiple punishments across
different trials.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="Document"><span><span>What makes the dual-sovereign context
interesting is that it allows us to understand, define, and test the due
process protection from multiple punishments in a setting where double jeopardy
protections do not apply. As a result, we can start to understand how rights
might be protected by due process if double jeopardy protections were more
limited. </span></span></p>

Second, the growth of the Internet has been accompanied with a corresponding
growth in Internet crime. With online black markets such as Silk Road and
secure electronic currency such as BitCoin, technology has made it easier for
individuals to engage in illegal activities across state lines.</span></span><a class="anchor" name="_ftnref29"></a><a class="footnote_link" href="https://www.yalelawjournal.org/#_ftnref29" id="footnote_number_29">29</a><span><span>

likelihood, will not disappear anytime soon. As a result, judges and
practitioners should consider the rights to which dual-sovereign defendants are
entitled.</span></span></p>

<h3 class="SubHead1 subhead_main">II. avoiding
redundant punishments<a class="anchor" name="ii-avoiding-redundant-punishments"></a></h3>
<p class="Document">As we saw in Part I.A, the due process protection from
multiple punishments can be understood as a protection from punishment without
legislative authorization. Specifically, we saw that the due process right is
violated when a defendant receives a punishment that is inconsistent with the
intent of the legislature, as indicated by statute. In this Part, I will
explore the limitations imposed by the Due Process Clause in the context of
dual-sovereign sentencing.</p>
<p class="Document">Consider two similarly situated states: Alabama and Balabama.
Suppose the states have separate criminal justice systems, but identical
criminal statutes. Suppose Alice commits a kidnapping that takes place in both
states. Alabama charges Alice with kidnapping, obtains a conviction, and
imposes the maximum possible sentence—twenty years in prison. After Alice
receives her sentence, Balabama decides to charge Alice with its version of the
same crime. Alice is once again convicted and receives an additional
twenty-year sentence.<a class="anchor" name="_ftnref31"></a><a class="footnote_link" href="https://www.yalelawjournal.org/#_ftnref31" id="footnote_number_31">31</a></p>
<p class="Document">Does the second twenty-year sentence violate the Due Process
Clause? The answer would seem to be yes. Legislatures assign punishments to
advance interests—an interest in keeping order, deterring crime, and so
on. A legislative determination that a certain sentence or sentencing range is
appropriate indicates that the legislature believes a sentence in the approved
range, if properly assigned, is sufficient to fully vindicate the state’s interest
with respect to that crime. Any additional punishment would be redundant and
would therefore run contrary to the intent of the legislature.</p>
<p class="Document">While this conclusion follows directly from the premise that
legislatures assign punishments to advance interests, one could reach the same
conclusion by examining the text of criminal statutes. When writing punishments
into law, legislatures at both the federal and state level typically express
punishments in the passive voice. Consider the following examples of statutory
language describing punishments: “whoever . . . is guilty of an assault <i>shall be punished</i> . . . by imprisonment
for not more than twenty years”;<a class="anchor" name="_ftnref32"></a><a class="footnote_link" href="https://www.yalelawjournal.org/#_ftnref32" id="footnote_number_32">32</a> “a person
convicted of burglary <i>shall be imprisoned</i>
not more than 15 years”;<a class="anchor" name="_ftnref33"></a><a class="footnote_link" href="https://www.yalelawjournal.org/#_ftnref33" id="footnote_number_33">33</a> “[e]very
person who shall falsely assume or pretend to be any . . . officer . . . <i>shall be punished</i> by imprisonment in the
county jail not more than one (1) year . . . .”<a class="anchor" name="_ftnref34"></a><a class="footnote_link" href="https://www.yalelawjournal.org/#_ftnref34" id="footnote_number_34">34</a>
This statutory form, which seems consistent across jurisdictions, verifies that
legislatures, even by their own terms, do not care <i>who</i> punishes a defendant. Instead, they care about <i>what</i> <i>punishment</i>
a defendant is to receive. The statutes state that a defendant “<i>shall be</i>” punished, not that “the State
shall impose a punishment.”<a class="anchor" name="_ftnref35"></a><a class="footnote_link" href="https://www.yalelawjournal.org/#_ftnref35" id="footnote_number_35">35</a> All told,
this means that the determination that a given punishment is sufficient to
satisfy a sovereign’s interest is made on the basis of the punishment
itself—not on how or by whom the punishment is dispensed.<a class="anchor" name="_ftnref36"></a><a class="footnote_link" href="https://www.yalelawjournal.org/#_ftnref36" id="footnote_number_36">36</a>
</p>
<p class="Document">The example of Alice’s cumulative forty-year sentence shows
how the Due Process Clause can limit the extent to which a court can assign
punishment to a dual-sovereign defendant. Where multiple sovereigns pursue
compatible interests by punishing a defendant for the same offense, the court
of a punishing sovereign should view punishments <i>cumulatively</i>: if a court would, in a single-sovereign context,
assign a punishment of <i>X</i>, that court
should, in a multi-sovereign context, assign a punishment of <i>X</i>-<i>Y</i>,
where <i>Y</i> is the cumulative punishment
the defendant has received to date.<a class="anchor" name="_ftnref37"></a><a class="footnote_link" href="https://www.yalelawjournal.org/#_ftnref37" id="footnote_number_37">37</a></p>
<p class="Document">In order to adopt this approach, a second sentencing court
would have to make two determinations: first, that the two sovereigns are
punishing a defendant for the same offense, and second, that the punishment
imposed by the first sentencing sovereign advances the interests of the second
sentencing sovereign. I will explore each of these determinations in turn.<a class="anchor" name="_ftnref38"></a><a class="footnote_link" href="https://www.yalelawjournal.org/#_ftnref38" id="footnote_number_38">38</a></p>
<h3 class="SubHead1">A. Same Offense<a class="anchor" name="a-same-offense"></a></h3>
<p class="Document">The premise underlying my advocacy is that a legislature
would not intend for a defendant to receive punishment for a single offense in
excess of what it has authorized by statute for that offense. This premise
demands an inquiry into how a court would determine whether two offenses are
the “same” for the purposes of legislative intent to punish. For if two
offenses were the same, then the punishment assigned for one would count
towards the punishment allowed for the other.</p>
<p class="Document">First, it is worth noting that, at its core, this is a question
of legislative intent. Any test or rule to discern legislative intent would do
nothing more than establish a <i>presumption
</i>that a legislature would view two crimes as the same. A legislature could,
in theory, decide to create two criminal offenses with identical elements,
intending that prosecutors would be able to charge, convict, and punish
defendants for one or both of the crimes.<a class="anchor" name="_ftnref39"></a><a class="footnote_link" href="https://www.yalelawjournal.org/#_ftnref39" id="footnote_number_39">39</a>
Likewise, a legislature could issue a statement indicating that, despite the
presence of identical elements, it does not intend for its crimes to be
considered the “same” as analogous crimes in other jurisdictions. Such a
statement of intent would supersede any presumptive test or rule. </p>
<p class="Document">In the absence of these statements, there are a number of
heuristics that courts can use to discern legislative intent and determine
whether a legislature would want to count part or all of one sentence towards
another.</p>
<p class="Document">In <i>Blockburger v.
United States</i>, the Supreme Court created a rule to determine whether two
crimes are the same for purposes of multiple prosecutions.<a class="anchor" name="_ftnref40"></a><a class="footnote_link" href="https://www.yalelawjournal.org/#_ftnref40" id="footnote_number_40">40</a>
While we are interested in the question of sameness for multiple punishments
rather than prosecutions, it follows naturally that if a legislature does not
want a defendant to be prosecuted for two crimes, then the legislature also
would not want a defendant to be punished for both crimes. Accordingly, <i>Blockburger </i>provides a good starting
point for our analysis. Under the Court’s decision in <i>Blockburger</i>, there is a presumption that two offenses are different
if each contains at least one statutory element the other does not.<a class="anchor" name="_ftnref41"></a><a class="footnote_link" href="https://www.yalelawjournal.org/#_ftnref41" id="footnote_number_41">41</a>
In effect, <i>Blockburger</i> means that two
offenses are the <i>same</i> if they contain
identical elements or if one is a lesser-included offense of the other. </p>
<p class="Document">It is worth noting that the <i>Blockburger </i>test was introduced in the context of single-sovereign
prosecutions. As a result, it focuses heavily on statutory language and
considers elements to be the same only if the underlying text describing the
respective elements is identical.<a class="anchor" name="_ftnref42"></a><a class="footnote_link" href="https://www.yalelawjournal.org/#_ftnref42" id="footnote_number_42">42</a> This poses a
problem in a multi-sovereign context, as different legislatures often express
the same idea in different ways.<a class="anchor" name="_ftnref43"></a><a class="footnote_link" href="https://www.yalelawjournal.org/#_ftnref43" id="footnote_number_43">43</a> Rather than
focusing on the letter of the statutory language, courts should adopt a
functional version of <i>Blockburger</i>, according
to which elements are evaluated according to the concepts and actions they
represent. Under this model, courts would be able to compare statutes from
different states. This approach “would seek to discern whether in fact the
statutes substantively describe the same offense.”<a class="anchor" name="_ftnref44"></a><a class="footnote_link" href="https://www.yalelawjournal.org/#_ftnref44" id="footnote_number_44">44</a></p>
<p class="Document">For the most part, the <i>Blockburger</i>
test will have few false positives;<a name="_Ref273377591"></a><a class="anchor" name="_ftnref45"></a><a class="footnote_link" href="https://www.yalelawjournal.org/#_ftnref45" id="footnote_number_45">45</a> it is unlikely that a legislature
would intend to assign independent punishments for two crimes with identical
elements. Similarly, because a lesser-included offense is, by definition, <i>included</i> in the corresponding greater
offense, the punishment for one necessarily incorporates all or part of the
punishment for the other, meaning that a legislature would probably not intend
to punish one person for both a greater offense and a lesser included offense.
These logical presumptions are strengthened by the fact that the <i>Blockburger</i> test has been in effect,
virtually continuously, since 1932, meaning that legislatures almost certainly
take the test into account when drafting legislation.<a class="anchor" name="_ftnref46"></a><a class="footnote_link" href="https://www.yalelawjournal.org/#_ftnref46" id="footnote_number_46">46</a></p>
<p class="Document">But while the <i>Blockburger</i>
test avoids false positives, it does not completely avoid the problem of false
negatives. In other words, the test may view certain pairs of crimes as
different that a legislature would likely want to punish as the same offense.
Akhil Amar explains: </p>
<p class="block_quote">Suppose Roberta is charged in a single trial with
eight-year armed robbery and nine-year bank robbery for a single act in which
she robbed a bank with a gun. Under the <i>Blockburger</i>
test, armed robbery is not the same as bank robbery—and so the maximum
penalties can be cumulated under <i>Blockburger</i>.
But this cumulation ends up double-counting the common-predicate robbery:
(robbery plus gun) plus (robbery plus bank)—(five plus three) plus (five
plus four). Notwithstanding <i>Blockburger</i>,
this double-counting should be treated as presumptively violative of due
process. If <i>Blockburger</i> would
(presumptively) prohibit double-counting the robbery in a
robbery-plus-armed-robbery trial, or in a robbery-plus-bank-robbery trial,
surely the true logic at work here should (presumptively) bar the similar double-counting
of the robbery in an armed-robbery-plus-bank-robbery trial.<a name="_Ref378052192"></a><a class="anchor" name="_ftnref47"></a><a class="footnote_link" href="https://www.yalelawjournal.org/#_ftnref47" id="footnote_number_47">47</a></p>
<p class="Document">This example shows how crimes with
overlapping elements can pose problems for the <i>Blockburger</i> test. </p>
<p class="Document">So how should a court deal with two crimes whose elements
overlap only in part? Unfortunately, there is no simple heuristic. Courts
should compare the elements of the two offenses, recognize the ways in which
the crimes differ, and then use common sense to determine whether the
differences between the crimes fundamentally change the character of one crime
relative to the other. If there is a significant overlap between the elements
and if both statutes are aimed at the same <i>kind
</i>of offense, as was the case with Roberta’s robbery charges, then a court
could reasonably conclude that at least part of the punishment from one offense
should count towards the punishment of the other. If, alternatively, there are
a small number of overlapping elements, or if the similarities are
insubstantial and do not constitute the essence of either crime, then it would
make more sense to view each punishment independently.</p>
<p class="Document">One way to determine whether the difference between two
statutes is significant is to ascertain the extent to which the <i>punishments</i> for the two crimes can be
attributed to the shared elements. In the example above, both crimes for which
Roberta was charged contained elements corresponding to robbery. If robbery,
viewed independently, carries a five-year sentence, then the punishment for
robbery would seem to account for most of the punishment for both armed robbery
(eight years) and bank robbery (nine years). This would suggest that the two
crimes (armed robbery and bank robbery) are simply aggravated instances of
plain robbery and thus that they are substantially similar in character. If,
alternatively, robbery, viewed on its own, would carry a one-year sentence,
then it would be much easier to conclude that the shared robbery element does
not contribute very much to either sentence—that bank robbery and armed
robbery represent distinct offenses and that each should be punished
independently.</p>
<p class="Document">For another example, consider 18 U.S.C. § 113, which
authorizes punishment for assaults that take place in the “special maritime and
territorial jurisdiction of the United States,” and 18 U.S.C. § 81, which
authorizes punishment for arsons committed in the same region. Both contain an
identical jurisdictional element. But the shared element is just
that—jurisdictional. It is not related to the substance of either crime,
nor can the punishment from either crime be attributed to the jurisdictional
element. This example shows how the presence of a common element is not
sufficient. Here, notwithstanding their similarities, the crimes clearly
constitute fundamentally different offenses and should thus be punished
independently.</p>
<p class="Document">It is worth noting that the determination of whether two
crimes are the same is not wholly different from the question of whether two
crimes advance different interests.<a class="anchor" name="_ftnref48"></a><a class="footnote_link" href="https://www.yalelawjournal.org/#_ftnref48" id="footnote_number_48">48</a>
In the ambiguous or difficult cases, where two crimes have many of the same
elements but are not necessarily of the same character, a judge could resolve
the problem by comparing the specific interests or motivations implicated by
the crimes at issue. If, read narrowly, the two crimes advance, in whole or in
part, substantially similar interests, then it would be reasonable to assign at
least part of the punishment of one crime to the other. This is not to say that
the question of interests is controlling. It is but one tool in the toolbox
and, like other heuristic tools, should be applied with sound judgment and
common sense. It also bears emphasis that judges are already expected to
implement the standard <i>Blockburger</i>
test and to determine a legislature’s interest based on the text and history of
a statute. The heuristics described in this Part seek simply to combine these
standard techniques with context-specific reasoning.</p>
<h3 class="SubHead1">B. Non-Conflicting
Interests<a class="anchor" name="b-non-conflicting-interests"></a></h3>
<p class="Document">The protection from redundant punishment applies only if two
sentencing sovereigns have the same interests or different interests that can
be advanced simultaneously. As argued above, legislatures assign punishments in
order to advance interests. If two legislatures pursue their interests in the
same way, then neither legislature would have reason to care which jurisdiction
imposed the punishment; regardless of who imposes the punishment, the interest
would be vindicated. This is what would allow the court of one jurisdiction to
adopt the punishment assigned by the court of another.</p>
<p class="Document">If, however, two legislatures pursue conflicting or
incompatible interests, then <i>each </i>jurisdiction
would need to implement its punishment in order to vindicate its interests. If
the punishment of one were imputed to the other, then at least one of the
interests would remain at least partially neglected.<a class="anchor" name="_ftnref49"></a><a class="footnote_link" href="https://www.yalelawjournal.org/#_ftnref49" id="footnote_number_49">49</a>
But how do we know which interests a sovereign seeks to advance? Moreover, how
do we know whether these interests conflict?</p>
<h3 class="SubHead1">1. Discerning
Interests<a class="anchor" name="1-discerning-interests"></a></h3>
<p class="Document">Before a judge can decide whether two interests are
compatible, the judge must first determine which interests he is dealing with.
This determination, as one might expect, is made on the basis of legislative
intent.</p>
<p class="Document">In most instances, it will not be difficult for a judge to
discern the legislative interests involved in a given statute. Many jurisdictions
have adopted explicit statements of purpose that explain the legislature’s
reasons for passing and maintaining criminal statutes.<a class="anchor" name="_ftnref50"></a><a class="footnote_link" href="https://www.yalelawjournal.org/#_ftnref50" id="footnote_number_50">50</a>
Unfortunately, congressional intent is not always clear. In the absence of a
well-articulated legislative interest, judges can consider several aspects of a
statute to determine which interests the statute is supposed to advance. For
example, judges can look to the elements needed to sustain a conviction, the
type of punishment authorized by the statute, and the extent to which the
severity of the punishment tracks the severity of the crime. Judges could also
consider the common law understanding of the crime at issue. </p>
<p class="Document">Absent evidence to the contrary, it is generally safe for a
court to assume that legislatures pass criminal statutes in order to
simultaneously advance interests in deterrence, rehabilitation, and, where
appropriate, incapacitation. Depending on the jurisdiction, a judge might also
conclude that a legislature was interested in retribution. These interests reflect
the purpose of punishment at common law and are almost always included in any
explicit statement of purpose adopted by a legislature.<a class="anchor" name="_ftnref51"></a><a class="footnote_link" href="https://www.yalelawjournal.org/#_ftnref51" id="footnote_number_51">51</a>
All told, even absent this presumption, a judge could accurately determine the
legislative interests implicated by a given crime.<a class="anchor" name="_ftnref52"></a><a class="footnote_link" href="https://www.yalelawjournal.org/#_ftnref52" id="footnote_number_52">52</a>
Indeed, judges are obligated to take legislative interests into account
whenever they dispense punishment.<a class="anchor" name="_ftnref53"></a><a class="footnote_link" href="https://www.yalelawjournal.org/#_ftnref53" id="footnote_number_53">53</a></p>
<p class="Document">When ascertaining legislative interests, a judge need only
consider the interests of the jurisdiction over which he presides. Because the
first sentencing jurisdiction has already advanced its interests (through the
imposition of the first punishment), the only relevant question facing a judge
is whether the punishmentimposed by
the first jurisdiction adequately advances the interests of the second
sovereign’s legislature. A judge would not need to consider the statutory
history or legislative goals of any other jurisdiction.</p>
<h3 class="SubHead1">2. Evaluating
Interests in Light of Punishments<a class="anchor" name="2-evaluating-interests-in-light-of-punishments"></a></h3>
<p class="Document">After discerning interests, a judge must determine whether
the sentence imposed by the first jurisdiction advances the interests of the
second jurisdiction. What happens when two sovereigns attempt to advance
incompatible interests, or when two sovereigns pursue similar interests, but
the punishment imposed by one does not advance the interests of the other?
Consider the interests of deterrence, respect for a sovereign’s authority, and
restoring the community. Each of these interests could be advanced by a punishment
requiring convicts to perform 100 hours of community service. As the service is
performed, the convict is at once improving the community he harmed, showing
others that criminals will be brought to justice, and investing himself in the
community. The value of the punishment, however, is predicated on the
defendant’s performance of community service in the community of the sentencing
jurisdiction. This shows that, with respect to certain punishments, some
interests can only be understood and vindicated in the context of the punishing
sovereign—Alabama’s interest in deterrence is not an interest in
deterring crime generally, but is rather an interest in deterring crime in <i>Alabama</i>. </p>
<p class="Document">At first, this sovereign-specific aspect of some crimes would
seem to defeat my proposition: if every interest can be articulated as a local
concern, unique to each sovereign, then we can never say that two sovereigns
are advancing the <i>same </i>interest. </p>
<p class="Document">The problem with this view is that it exaggerates the role of
localized punishments. Many punishments can advance the interests of multiple
sovereigns at the same time. The best example is prison. Suppose two
legislatures impose punishment to keep their citizens safe from dangerous
criminals. As we saw above, this <i>could</i>
be articulated as two distinct interests: the interest in protecting citizens
of the first state, and the interest in protecting citizens of the second
state. Nevertheless, the fact remains that one prison sentence effectively and
completely addresses the concerns of <i>both
</i>legislatures at the same time and in the same way. So while almost every
interest <i>can</i> be viewed as distinct
and localized, it makes sense to adopt such a construction only when the first
punishment at issue leaves a local interest unresolved.</p>
<p class="Document">On the other hand, what if two states assign the same
punishment, but in pursuit of different interests? Suppose both Alabama and
Balabama impose a five-year sentence for theft—Alabama, because it
believes it takes five years for a thief to reform, and Balabama because it
believes a punishment of less than five years will not adequately deter future
crime. These interests do not overlap. In such a scenario, should the Due
Process Clause prevent the imposition of both sentences? As we saw in the
discussion above, the operative test is whether the interests can be fully
accomplished at the same time with the same sentence. If so, any additional
punishment would be redundant and would therefore fall outside the scope of
punishment authorized by either legislature. Since both deterrence and
rehabilitation can be satisfied fully and completely by a single five-year
sentence, no further punishment was intended, and none would be authorized.</p>
<p class="Document">Under my proposal, if a court would ordinarily assign a
punishment of <i>X</i>, it should instead
assign a punishment of <i>X - Y</i>, where <i>Y</i> is the cumulative punishment the
defendant has received for the same crime up to that time. Because courts can,
in effect, address multiple interests simultaneously and without conflict, it
will be helpful to think of <i>Y</i> in two
parts: <i>Ycompatible</i> and
<i>Yincompatible</i>. <i>Ycompatible </i>represents the
portions of the first sentence that are compatible with the interests advanced
by the typical second sentence, while <i>Yincompatible
</i>represents the portions of the first sentence that are incompatible. Note
that <i>Ycompatible </i>and <i>Yincompatible </i>are
complements, such that <i>Ytotal =
Ycompatible + Yincompatible</i>. The amount by which a
sentencing court would have to reduce its usual sentence would be the full
amount of the cumulative sentence received until that point, excepting those
portions that do not and cannot resolve the interests of the second sentencing
sovereign. That is, the second sentencing court should assign a punishment of <i>X - (Ytotal - Yincompatible)</i>,
or, equivalently, <i>X - Ycompatible</i>.</p>
<p class="Document">As an example, suppose two states, <i>A</i> and <i>B</i>, attempt to
advance interests in payback to the community. State <i>A</i> sentences first and assigns a punishment of 100 hours of
community service, to be performed in <i>A</i>.
<i>B</i>, the second sentencing state, would
ordinarily assign a punishment of 100 hours of community service, to be
performed in <i>B</i>. Because <i>B</i> is punishing to advance local
interests, the punishment dispensed by State <i>A</i> does not at all vindicate the interests of State <i>B</i>. Accordingly, no sentence reduction is
appropriate, and <i>B</i> should assign its
full punishment of 100 hours of community service, to be performed in <i>B</i> (in other words, <i>Yincompatible = Ytotal, Ycompatible = </i><i><span>0</span>,
and X - Ycompatible = X</i>).<a class="anchor" name="_ftnref54"></a><a class="footnote_link" href="https://www.yalelawjournal.org/#_ftnref54" id="footnote_number_54">54</a></p>
<p class="Document">But what happens if two interests overlap? If the punishment
dispensed by one state <i>partially </i>vindicates
the interests of another? Suppose State <i>A</i>
assigns 100 hours of community service to instill a sense of loyalty and
community engagement,<a class="anchor" name="_ftnref55"></a><a class="footnote_link" href="https://www.yalelawjournal.org/#_ftnref55" id="footnote_number_55">55</a> while State <i>B</i> assigns the same amount of community
service to deter future crimes. If <i>A</i>
sentences first, it cannot be said that <i>B</i>’s
interest is left <i>completely</i>
unvindicated; citizens of <i>B</i> would
know that a crime took place and that the culprit was captured, convicted, and
punished. At the same time, at least some of the deterrent benefit is
predicated on <i>B</i>’s citizens <i>seeing </i>the criminal performing community
service and recognizing the personal embarrassment they would experience if
they were to commit the crime. In such a situation, the determination of how
much a punishment vindicated a legislature’s interest would be left to the
discretion of the sentencing judge. In this example, a judge could reasonably
decide that the bulk of the deterrent effect is simply in the assignment of a
punishment, and therefore that B’s interests are, for the most part, vindicated
by the defendant’s community service to State <i>A</i>. If the second sentencing judge found that <i>A</i>’s sentence vindicated 80% of <i>B</i>’s
interests, then he would only need to impose an additional 20 hours of
community service, to be performed in State <i>B</i>.
In terms of the variables described above, <i>X</i>
= 100 hours of community service, <i>Ycompatible
</i>= 80 hours, and <i>Yincompatible</i>
= 20 hours, yielding an additional punishment of 100 – 80 = 20
additional hours of community service, to be performed in State <i>B</i>.</p>
<p class="Document">Note that when sentences are of a different type, the
sentencing judge has considerable discretion when it comes to determining the
values of <i>Ycompatible</i>
and <i>Yincompatible</i>. A
judge’s finding that part of a prior sentence can be included in <i>Ycompatible</i> is equivalent to
a finding that the legislature would have authorized that portion of punishment
(and thus that any additional punishment would be unauthorized and in violation
of the Due Process Clause). While it is sometimes possible to make such a
finding, it is not always clear that the legislature would have adopted the sentence
imposed by another jurisdiction—even in part. </p>
<p class="Document">Suppose, for example, that State <i>A</i> assigns a punishment of imprisonment, while State <i>B</i> assigns a hefty fine. A judge from
State <i>A</i> might not be able to
determine with confidence the extent to which a fine adequately substitutes for
time in prison. Equivalently, a judge from State <i>B</i> might not be able to determine the extent to which a fine should
be reduced on account of the time the defendant will spend in prison.</p>
<p class="Document">The situation is analogous to one in which a second-shift
chef comes on duty and is told he must have 50 liters of cider ready for
distribution by the end of his shift. Suppose the chef finds a note left by the
first-shift chef indicating that 20 liters of cider have already been prepared.
In this scenario, the second-shift chef would know to make 50 - 20 = 30
additional liters of cider. Suppose instead that the note indicated that 0.5 <i>cubic feet </i>of cider had been prepared.
Absent a conversion table, the note would be useless (50 liters - 0.5 cubic feet
= ?). To ensure he had 50 liters ready for sale, the chef would have no choice
but to prepare all 50 liters during his shift. </p>
<p class="Document">These examples show why the due process protection from
multiple punishments would likely play a much smaller role where dual-sovereign
prosecutions involve different types of sentences. When different types of
punishments are involved, reducing one sentence on account of another can be
quite difficult: 20 years imprisonment - 5 years imprisonment = 15 years of
additional imprisonment,<a name="_Ref274758129"></a><a class="anchor" name="_ftnref56"></a><a class="footnote_link" href="https://www.yalelawjournal.org/#_ftnref56" id="footnote_number_56">56</a> but 20 years imprisonment - $10,000
in fines = ?. In the face of such uncertainty, the only way to ensure that both
sovereigns’ interests are fully vindicated would be for the second sentencing
court to assign its punishment in full. </p>
<p class="Document">Of course, if a judge can determine with sufficient certainty
that the punishment imposed by an earlier sentencing court would have been
approved and adopted, in whole or in part, by the legislature, then the due
process requirement would apply with full force and the judge would have to
reduce the sentence accordingly. In terms of the analogy above, this
determination would be equivalent to the chef’s determination that 0.5 cubic
feet is equivalent to 14 liters or, using a more conservative estimate, that
0.5 cubic feet is certainly greater than 10 liters. To make such
determinations, judges can look to the different types of sentences authorized
by the statute at issue as well as to other statutes that contain both types of
punishments. If State <i>B</i>’s legislature
regularly passed statutes allowing a court to impose either a fine or a term of
imprisonment, then the judge from State <i>B</i>
might be able to ascertain a “conversion rate,” of sorts, between the two types
of sentences. The judge could then determine a reasonable value for <i>Ycompatible</i>. It is also
possible that if this type of sentencing reduction were recognized,
legislatures would provide more explicit guidance.</p>
<p class="Document"><span>This principle
extends to instances in which legislatures authorize mixed sentences. Suppose a
judge from State <i>A</i> assigns a mixed
punishment of two years’ imprisonment and a $500 fine. If a judge from State <i>B</i> would ordinarily assign a punishment
of four years’ imprisonment (with no fine), then the Due Process Clause would
require the <i>B</i>-state judge to impute
the two years of imprisonment from the first sentence to the second sentence (<i>Ycompatible </i>= two years).
Because the remaining portion of the first sentence is of a different kind, the
second sentencing court would have to assign two additional years of imprisonment
(<i>X - Ycompatible</i>) to
vindicate its interests. Note that the <i>B</i>-state
court cannot necessarily impute the $500 fine to <i>B</i> because fines constitute a different type of punishment than
imprisonment. The end result is that when dealing with mixed sentences, judges
would evaluate each component of the sentence separately.</span></p>
<h3 class="SubHead1">3. “Phantom”
Due Process Violations<a class="anchor" name="3-phantom-due-process-violations"></a></h3>
<p class="Document">What happens when interests are advanced asymmetrically?
Suppose State <i>A</i> would normally assign
100 hours of community service in order to advance an interest in restoring the
community to the condition it was in prior to the defendant’s commission of the
crime. Suppose State <i>B</i> would normally
assign 100 hours of community service to deter future crimes. In this scenario,
<i>A</i>’s punishment would significantly
advance <i>B</i>’s interests, but <i>B</i>’s punishment would not advance <i>A</i>’s interests at all. </p>
<p class="Document">Interestingly, the total sentence a defendant would receive
depends on which state punishes first. If <i>A</i>
punishes first, then <i>B</i> would not need
to assign much (if any) additional punishment. As discussed above, the
defendant might receive a total sentence of 120 hours of community service, 100
of which must be served in <i>A</i> and 20
of which must be served in <i>B</i>. If,
however, <i>B</i> punishes first, <i>B</i> would impose its sentence and, since <i>B</i>’s punishment does not advance <i>A</i>’s interests in the slightest, <i>A</i> would then impose <i>its</i> full sentence. The defendant would thus receive a total of 200
hours of community service (evenly split between the two states)—80 hours
<i>more </i>than is needed to satisfy the
interests of both legislatures. </p>
<p class="Document">In essence, this punishment constitutes something of a
phantom-error. There <i>is</i> a due process
violation, since the defendant received a punishment greater than what was needed.
Yet, we cannot point to a specific error or mistake that created the violation;
both sentencing courts acted appropriately. To make things more difficult, the
phantom-error could not have been avoided—the second sentencing court (<i>A</i>) needed to impose the full sentence to
vindicate its interests, and it lacked the authority to reduce the sentence
imposed by the first sentencing court (<i>B</i>).
The absence of a procedural error would make it very difficult to obtain a
sentence adjustment using normal procedural mechanisms.<a class="anchor" name="_ftnref57"></a><a class="footnote_link" href="https://www.yalelawjournal.org/#_ftnref57" id="footnote_number_57">57</a>

developments.<a class="anchor" name="_ftnref58"></a><a class="footnote_link" href="https://www.yalelawjournal.org/#_ftnref58" id="footnote_number_58">58</a>
Accordingly, the Due Process Clause should allow a defendant in such a

<h3 class="SubHead1 subhead_main">III. the impact on plea bargains<a class="anchor" name="iii-the-impact-on-plea-bargains"></a></h3>
<p class="Document">Thus far, this Note has focused on how dual-sovereign
defendants can benefit from the protection from multiple punishments during the
sentencing phase of their trials. While the sentencing phase of a trial is significant,
it is important to recognize that over ninety percent of state and federal
prosecutions end with plea bargains.<a class="anchor" name="_ftnref60"></a><a class="footnote_link" href="https://www.yalelawjournal.org/#_ftnref60" id="footnote_number_60">60</a>
In this Part, I will show how the protection from multiple punishments, if
recognized, would also enhance the efficiency and fairness of plea
negotiations.</p>
<p class="Document">In a world with protection from multiple punishments, the
worst-case scenario for a defendant would be the imposition of the most severe
punishment from the harshest sovereign that could charge him. In contrast, if
there were <i>no </i>protections from
multiple punishments, then the worst-case scenario would be the imposition of
the most severe punishment from <i>each </i>of
the sovereigns that could charge him. This difference significantly impacts a
defendant’s bargaining power in negotiations with prosecutors.</p>
<p class="Document">Where there is protection from multiple punishments,
sentences are evaluated cumulatively. As a result, the plea agreement that a
defendant makes with one jurisdiction would decrease the punishment he could
receive from another. In scenarios where multiple sovereigns want to prosecute,
this would effectively allow defendants to carry plea agreements and sentences
from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Therefore, when it comes to future plea
negotiations, a defendant would have less to lose by going to trial. Rather
than risk the imposition of a full sentence, a defendant would risk only the
imposition of the difference between the sentence he <i>already </i>received (whether through a plea deal or otherwise) and the
sentence pursued by the prosecutor. </p>
<p class="Document">Interestingly, this means that the “worse” a defendant does
in one set of plea negotiations, the better his position will be in the next.
Defendants can use this to their advantage to obtain a plea agreement that will
optimize their multi-sovereign result. As an example, suppose Bob commits a
crime that can be charged in State <i>A</i>
and State <i>B</i>. Both states’ versions of
the crime have a maximum sentence of twenty years’ imprisonment. Suppose the
prosecutor from State <i>B</i> would only
charge Bob if he could obtain a sentence of greater than six years. State <i>A</i> prosecutes Bob first and offers him a
plea agreement of ten years. If Bob accepts the deal, then <i>B</i> will prosecute and Bob could receive an additional sentence of up
to ten years. If, however, Bob requests a plea agreement of fourteen years,
then <i>B</i>’s interests would be satisfied
and <i>B</i> would have no need to
prosecute. Strangely, by adding four years to his plea agreement, Bob reduced
his overall sentence by up to six years. This example shows how, if we
recognize a protection from multiple punishments, defendants would approach
plea bargains from a multi-sovereign perspective—with the knowledge that
the plea they make in an early prosecution will have significant ramifications
in a later one. In such a system, defendants would attempt to obtain a plea
agreement that would satisfy <i>all </i>interested
sovereigns, rather than one that would simply satisfy the sovereign involved in
the specific prosecution.<a class="anchor" name="_ftnref61"></a><a class="footnote_link" href="https://www.yalelawjournal.org/#_ftnref61" id="footnote_number_61">61</a></p>
<p class="Document">In contrast, consider how plea bargains work where there is
no protection from multiple punishments. Because sentences are <i>not </i>evaluated cumulatively, each
prosecution is completely independent. This means prosecutors have just as much
to gain from a second prosecution as they do from a first (and just as much to
gain from a third prosecution as they do from a second)—regardless of the
punishments a defendant has already received. To extend the previous example,
State <i>B</i> would prosecute Bob
regardless of the deal he arranged with <i>A</i>,
because no matter what, the <i>B</i>-state prosecutor
would be able to obtain a sentence of up to twenty years—well above the
six-year threshold.</p>
<p class="Document">With protection, the bargaining power of a defendant <i>increases </i>with each subsequent
prosecution. Without protection, the bargaining power of a defendant decreases,
or, at the very least, remains the same. This increase in bargaining power is a
positive development for two reasons. </p>
<p class="Document">First, as suggested above, the increase in bargaining power
is functionally conditioned on defendants entering plea negotiations from a
multi-sovereign perspective. If a defendant determines that the prosecuting
sovereigns are only interested in obtaining a certain cumulative sentence, then
he can adjust his negotiation strategy accordingly. Likewise, if a defendant
determines that the sovereigns are interested only in obtaining a sentence of a
certain length, then he can avoid a second prosecution by ensuring that his
first punishment is sufficiently large. In sum, applying cumulative sentences
allows defendants to pursue an inter-sovereign plea bargaining strategy so as
to satisfy multiple interests (including his own) simultaneously.</p>
<p class="Document">The second reason why increasing defendants’ bargaining power
is a positive development is that it compensates for many of the systemic
disadvantages facing defendants in multi-sovereign prosecutions. The mere fact
of successive prosecutions disadvantages defendants for two reasons. First, in
successive prosecutions, prosecutors have access to more information about
defendants’ preferences and bargaining limits than they would if they started
from a blank slate. This information, in turn, provides prosecutors with more
leverage in negotiations, as they have a greater idea of just how far they can
push defendants. </p>
<p class="Document">The second reason that successive prosecutions disadvantage
defendants is that multiple prosecutions can wear down defendants and decrease
the vigor with which they approach the plea bargaining process.<a class="anchor" name="_ftnref62"></a><a class="footnote_link" href="https://www.yalelawjournal.org/#_ftnref62" id="footnote_number_62">62</a>
Indeed, the Supreme Court has long recognized the burden successive
prosecutions can have on defendants. This burden is no less significant in the
context of successive multi-sovereign prosecutions as it is in successive
single-sovereign prosecutions. If anything, the exhaustion and anxiety
experienced by defendants would be <i>worse </i>in
a multi-sovereign context: inherent in any multi-sovereign prosecution is a
shuttling of the defendant from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, from prison to
prison, and from courthouse to courthouse. This shuttling would destroy
whatever minimal sense of stability, reliability, and security a defendant
would have been able to muster in the case of successive single-sovereign prosecutions.
Even worse, the further a defendant travels, the more likely it is that he will
be further away from friends and loved ones who can provide critical moral
support.<a class="anchor" name="_ftnref63"></a><a class="footnote_link" href="https://www.yalelawjournal.org/#_ftnref63" id="footnote_number_63">63</a>
By increasing defendants’ bargaining power, the protection from multiple punishments
helps counterbalance the systemic disadvantages facing defendants in
multi-sovereign cases.<a class="anchor" name="_ftnref64"></a><a class="footnote_link" href="https://www.yalelawjournal.org/#_ftnref64" id="footnote_number_64">64</a></p>
<h3 class="SubHead1 subhead_main">IV. some
objections<a class="anchor" name="iv-some-objections"></a></h3>
<p class="Document">In this Part, I will introduce and respond to some possible
objections to my argument. </p>
<h3 class="SubHead1">A. Legislatures Intend to
Assign Multiple Punishments
<a class="anchor" name="a-legislatures-intend-to-assign-multiple-punishments"></a></h3>
<p class="Document">In response to my advocacy, one could argue that legislatures
intend to assign multiple punishments to defendants whose crimes extend across
several states.<a class="anchor" name="_ftnref65"></a><a class="footnote_link" href="https://www.yalelawjournal.org/#_ftnref65" id="footnote_number_65">65</a>
The Supreme Court has often recognized that legislatures are presumed to
understand the current state of the law.<a class="anchor" name="_ftnref66"></a><a class="footnote_link" href="https://www.yalelawjournal.org/#_ftnref66" id="footnote_number_66">66</a>
As it stands, there is no prohibition on assigning duplicative punishments to
inter-sovereign defendants. Because legislatures operate against a backdrop of
multiple punishments, one could argue that the legislatures tacitly accept and
support multiple punishments for inter-sovereign defendants—that
legislatures believe interstate crimes are so problematic as to warrant
additional punishment beyond what the legislature would normally assign.
Moreover, one could argue that legislatures intend the severity of the
additional punishment to track the punishments assigned by the other punishing
sovereigns. Because due process rights are implicated only when a redundant
punishment is assigned <i>without</i>
legislative authorization, it follows that, if legislatures intended a
defendant to receive multiple punishments, there would be no constitutional
problem.</p>
<p class="Document">This argument is problematic for two reasons. First, the Due
Process Clause does not provide a right to be free from punishment absent <i>tacit legislative approval</i>. It provides
a right to be free from punishment absent <i>legislative
authorization</i>. The fact that a legislature does not explicitly address a
practice does not mean the legislature <i>approves
</i>of the practice.<a class="anchor" name="_ftnref67"></a><a class="footnote_link" href="https://www.yalelawjournal.org/#_ftnref67" id="footnote_number_67">67</a> </p>
<p class="Document">The second problem with this argument is that it leaves the
scope of additional punishment to the discretion of another sovereign. In order
for a legislature to adopt a punishment, it must know what it is adopting.
Here, if a legislature thought the interstate nature of a crime warranted
additional punishment, it would have to specify what additional punishment was
warranted. As it stands, there is no way for one legislature to control or
limit the punishment dispensed by another. This means the additional punishment
a legislature would “intend” to assign would depend not on that legislature’s <i>own </i>interest, but rather on the
interests of another jurisdiction. If allowed, this would create unpredictable
and disproportionate results. As an example, suppose one state assigned a
punishment of five years for a given offense while another state assigned a
punishment of forty years and a third state assigned a punishment of fifty
years. It would be preposterous to contend that the first legislature intended
the interstate nature of the crime to increase the defendant’s sentence from
five years to forty-five years, let alone from five years to ninety-five years.<a class="anchor" name="_ftnref68"></a><a class="footnote_link" href="https://www.yalelawjournal.org/#_ftnref68" id="footnote_number_68">68</a>
</p>
<p class="Document">Clearly, legislatures do not intend to supplement their
punishments with those assigned by other jurisdictions. Moreover, the exceedingly
disproportionate result of such incorporation<a class="anchor" name="_ftnref69"></a><a class="footnote_link" href="https://www.yalelawjournal.org/#_ftnref69" id="footnote_number_69">69</a>
suggests that legislatures would not be able to adopt the punishments assigned
by other jurisdictions, even if they wanted to.<a class="anchor" name="_ftnref70"></a><a class="footnote_link" href="https://www.yalelawjournal.org/#_ftnref70" id="footnote_number_70">70</a>
</p>
<h3 class="SubHead1">B. Prohibiting Multiple
Punishments Will Enable Quashing<a class="anchor" name="b-prohibiting-multiple-punishments-will-enable-quashing"></a></h3>
<p class="Document">Another objection one might make is that prohibiting multiple
punishments will enable one jurisdiction to frustrate the interests of another.
This argument, which is sometimes used to defend the dual sovereignty doctrine,<a name="_Ref378042291"></a><a class="anchor" name="_ftnref71"></a><a class="footnote_link" href="https://www.yalelawjournal.org/#_ftnref71" id="footnote_number_71">71</a> maintains that one jurisdiction
could use a “sham trial” or sham sentence to preclude a subsequent prosecution.
In the context of multiple punishments, one could argue that a jurisdiction
could convict a defendant and impose a punishment large enough to vindicate the
interests of any other jurisdiction. In light of the sentence imposed by the
first jurisdiction, other sovereigns that would ordinarily prosecute would have
nothing more to gain. After the practical prosecution period has passed,<a class="anchor" name="_ftnref72"></a><a class="footnote_link" href="https://www.yalelawjournal.org/#_ftnref72" id="footnote_number_72">72</a>
the first jurisdiction would commute the sentence, effectively allowing the
defendant to get away with much less punishment than he otherwise would have
received, and preventing other jurisdictions from fully and effectively
vindicating their interests.</p>
<p class="Document">While prosecution preclusion poses serious problems for those
opposed to the dual sovereignty doctrine, it has much less force when applied
to the protection from multiple punishments. The Due Process Clause prohibits a
second sentencing court from imposing a redundant sentence, but it does not
prevent the court from <i>conditionally</i>
adopting the sentence imposed by the first jurisdiction. Such an adoption would
recognize that the defendant would normally have received a full sentence, but
that imposition of the sentence can be suspended, so long as the first
sentencing jurisdiction follows through with its assigned punishment.<a class="anchor" name="_ftnref73"></a><a class="footnote_link" href="https://www.yalelawjournal.org/#_ftnref73" id="footnote_number_73">73</a>
Under such a view, one jurisdiction acting alone would not be able to commute a
defendant’s sentence in full. Instead, it would only be able to commute the
portions of the defendant’s sentence that do not advance the interests of the
second sentencing court.<a class="anchor" name="_ftnref74"></a><a class="footnote_link" href="https://www.yalelawjournal.org/#_ftnref74" id="footnote_number_74">74</a> Functionally,
it would be as though the two jurisdictions imposed concurrent sentences.
Commuting one of two concurrent sentences does not, in actuality, reduce the
sentence a convict actually receives.</p>
<p class="Document">Unfortunately, a conditional adoption of another sovereign’s
punishment does not fully solve the problem. The conditional adoption can only
take place if the second sovereign brings a case in the first place. But if the
first punishing sovereign imposes a full punishment, other sovereigns would
accomplish little through a second prosecution. As described above, the first
sovereign could wait until a second prosecution becomes infeasible before
commuting the sentence, thereby frustrating or, at the very least,
significantly hampering other sovereigns’ ability to pursue their interests.
The reason why this scenario does not constitute a significant problem is that
interactions between sovereigns are not one-time events. The way different
jurisdictions approach successive prosecutions in any given case will be
informed by their prior experiences. Accordingly, if one sovereign quashes or
frustrates the interests of another, other jurisdictions will be on notice and
will, in subsequent cases, initiate their prosecutions without regard to the
actions of the quashing sovereign. In doing so, they will impose their own
punishment and will thus avoid the potential commutation of their preferred
sentences.</p>
<h3 class="SubHead1">C. Prosecutorial Discretion<a class="anchor" name="c-prosecutorial-discretion"></a></h3>
<h3 class="SubHead1">1. Prosecutors,
Not Judges, Should Evaluate Interests<a class="anchor" name="1-prosecutors-not-judges-should-evaluate-interests"></a></h3>
<p class="Document">Under my proposal, the determination
of whether a punishment satisfies the interests advanced by a legislature would
be made by a judge. In opposition to my advocacy, one could argue that it would
be better if this determination were left to the discretion of prosecutors.
More specifically, one could argue that a prosecutor’s decision to bring a
second set of charges reflects a determination that the punishment imposed by
the first sentencing jurisdiction is insufficient and that additional
punishment is needed. Because prosecutors regularly consider the extent to
which a defendant has already been punished and potentially the extent to which
the sovereign’s interests have already been vindicated,<a class="anchor" name="_ftnref75"></a><a class="footnote_link" href="https://www.yalelawjournal.org/#_ftnref75" id="footnote_number_75">75</a><span> one could argue that prosecutorial
discretion functions as an effective proxy for legislative intent and therefore
that there is no due process violation.</span></p>
<p class="Document">While this objection seems persuasive, there are two reasons
why it does not undermine the need for judges to engage in the due process
multi-punishment inquiry. First, due process rights are guaranteed by the
Constitution and so cannot be left to the discretion of a prosecutor. Just as a
court cannot enter a judgment for a non-existent crime, so too a court cannot
assign a punishment that is in excess of the punishment authorized by a
legislature. This is true regardless of whether a prosecutor exercises
discretion when bringing a charge or requesting a sentence.</p>
<p class="Document">Second, by statute, prosecutors often lack authority to
exercise discretion over sentences. For instance, suppose State <i>A</i> convicts a defendant of a crime and
assigns a punishment of ten years’ imprisonment. Further suppose that State <i>B</i> has an equivalent version of the same
crime, but that State <i>B</i>’s version of
the crime has a mandatory minimum sentence of eleven years’ imprisonment. An
additional year of imprisonment is needed to satisfy State <i>B</i>’s interests. The problem is that a prosecutor from State <i>B</i> has no control over mandatory
minimums. If a State <i>B</i> prosecutor
were to charge the defendant, he would not have the power to assign the
appropriate punishment, even if he wanted to. Only the judge would have the
authority to reduce the sentence on due process grounds.<a class="anchor" name="_ftnref76"></a><a class="footnote_link" href="https://www.yalelawjournal.org/#_ftnref76" id="footnote_number_76">76</a>
In short, while it is certainly a sound practice for prosecutors to consider
the extent to which additional prosecution is necessary, judicial review and
discretion are still essential. </p>
<h3 class="SubHead1">2. Selective
Charging<a class="anchor" name="2-selective-charging"></a></h3>
<p class="Document">While some may be concerned that my proposal
does not leave enough room for prosecutorial discretion, others might argue
that my proposal does not do enough to limit prosecutorial discretion.
Specifically, one could argue that prosecutors could avoid a net sentence
reduction by charging defendants with offenses carrying higher penalties.
Suppose Arthur commits a crime across States <i>A</i> and <i>B</i>. State <i>A</i> convicts Arthur and assigns a
punishment of five years’ imprisonment. Normally, the prosecutor and State <i>B</i> would seek to obtain a sentence
similar to that of State <i>A</i>. In this
case, however, the prosecutor knows that if he adopts his usual strategy and
obtains a five-year sentence, then the sentencing judge would use Arthur’s
prior punishment to functionally reduce the sentence to zero years. To avoid
this outcome, the prosecutor decides to charge Arthur with a more serious
version of the same offense. If he obtains a conviction, Arthur will receive a
sentence of ten years (or five years, after taking into account Arthur’s
previous punishment). One could argue that if prosecutors can avoid a sentence
reduction by exercising their charge discretion, then my proposal would have
little impact. This objection is flawed for two reasons.</p>
<p class="Document"><span><span>First, it assumes the existence of a more
severe charge containing the same (or similar) elements. This creates something
of a double-bind. If a more severe charge does not exist, then the objection
crumbles, even if accepted on its own terms. If, however, a more severe charge <i>does </i>exist, then it is safe to conclude
that it exists because the state legislature wants it to exist. In other words,
if a more severe charge exists, then no due process violation would be
implicated by sentencing a defendant under that charge. The due process
protection discussed in this paper is concerned only with the question of
whether a sentence is authorized by the legislature. It is not concerned with
whether a prosecutor exercises his discretion consistently. That is, the
appropriate sentence baseline to consider is the punishment authorized by the
legislature of the sentencing state, as indicated by statute—<i>not </i>the sentence that, all things
considered, would have been imposed had the defendant only been charged by one
sovereign.</span></span></p>
<p class="Document"><span><span>Second, the objection fails to consider that
prosecutorial discretion is not absolute. Even in a dual-sovereign context,
concerns of selective and vindictive prosecution still apply and still protect
defendants. If a prosecutor charges Betty (and dozens of other similarly
situated individuals), a single-sovereign defendant, under one statute, and
Arthur, a multi-sovereign defendant who committed an identical crime under
identical circumstances (but for the interstate nature of his crime) under a
different statute, then Arthur would likely have a strong claim for selective
prosecution. While prosecutors have broad discretion,</span></span><a class="anchor" name="_ftnref77"></a><a class="footnote_link" href="https://www.yalelawjournal.org/#_ftnref77" id="footnote_number_77">77</a><span><span>
their discretion is not unlimited. Specifically, prosecutors are not allowed to
retaliate against defendants for exercising their constitutional rights.</span></span><a class="anchor" name="_ftnref78"></a><a class="footnote_link" href="https://www.yalelawjournal.org/#_ftnref78" id="footnote_number_78">78</a><span><span> If
a prosecutor assigns a more severe charge and/or attempts to obtain a more
severe sentence because a defendant has invoked or would likely invoke his due
process right to be protected from punishment absent legislative authorization,
then a defendant could reasonably argue that the more severe charge is
illegitimate. As the Supreme Court recognized in <i>Bordenkircher v. Hayes</i>, “[t]o punish a person because he has done
what the law plainly allows him to do is a due process violation of the most
basic sort.”</span></span><a class="anchor" name="_ftnref79"></a><a class="footnote_link" href="https://www.yalelawjournal.org/#_ftnref79" id="footnote_number_79">79</a></p>
<h3 class="SubHead1 subhead_main">Conclusion<a class="anchor" name="conclusion"></a></h3>
<p class="Document">The Double Jeopardy Clause provides protection from multiple
prosecutions and from multiple punishments. Except when it doesn’t. Where two
or more sovereigns are involved, double jeopardy protections seem to disappear.
The criticisms leveled against the dual sovereignty doctrine have been varied
and plentiful. But when it comes to solutions, something always seems to get
lost in the mix. What makes the doctrine difficult to grapple with is the fact
that the Constitution protects not just the interests of defendants, but also
the integrity of our federalist system. Any solution to the dual sovereignty
problem must therefore take seriously the validity and integrity of sovereign
interests, both at the state and federal level. But recognizing sovereign
interests is not enough. Proposed reforms must also take seriously a
defendant's right to receive only as much punishment as is needed to advance
the interests of the sentencing legislatures.</p>
<p class="Document">The problem is that essentially every proposed reform fails
to take into account one or both of these interests. Abandoning the doctrine
whole hog would allow any sovereign to nullify the law of every other
sovereign. Replacing the doctrine with a requirement that all interested
sovereigns take part in a joint prosecution would prevent each jurisdiction
from pursuing its own preferred strategy, would be unwieldy and inefficient,
and would not prevent one state from nullifying the interests of another. Likewise,
replacing the doctrine with a rule that allows a second prosecution to go
forward only if a court determines <i>ex
ante </i>that the first proceeding advanced “different interests” would fail to
take into account the <i>extent </i>to which
the first proceeding failed to sufficiently advance those interests and would
allow the first sovereign to quash the interests of the second <i>ex post </i>through an after-the-fact
pardon.</p>
<p class="Document">Where each of these proposals fails, mine succeeds. On the
sovereign side, any jurisdiction would be free to pursue a prosecution to
advance its interests; the proceedings of one jurisdiction would not be able to
undermine those of any other, either ex ante or ex post; and all judgment calls
relating to the decision to prosecute or to the optimal trial strategy would be
left to the discretion of a jurisdiction’s prosecutors, where they belong.</p>
<p class="Document">On the defendant side, viewing sentences cumulatively allows
a defendant to avoid excessive, unauthorized, and unnecessary punishments; the
relative certainty associated with sentencing maximums would alleviate much of
the anxiety and tension associated with multiple prosecutions and multiple
trials; and the protection from multiple punishments would have a spillover
effect that makes multiple prosecutionsless
likely. </p>
<p class="Document">In <i>Double Jeopardy Law
Made Simple</i>, Akhil Amar argues that the due process principle of collateral
estoppel can fill in the gaps and protect defendants where double jeopardy
cannot.<a class="anchor" name="_ftnref80"></a><a class="footnote_link" href="https://www.yalelawjournal.org/#_ftnref80" id="footnote_number_80">80</a>
It seems the Due Process Clause is at it again. While the dual sovereignty
doctrine constitutes a giant blind spot in double jeopardy jurisprudence, the
Constitution has not left defendants high and dry. The due process protection
from punishment without legislative authorization addresses the flaws of the
dual sovereignty doctrine without sacrificing the principles of sovereignty and
independent governance that justify the doctrine in the first place. If the
dual sovereignty doctrine is a blind spot, then due process is double jeopardy’s
rear-view mirror.</p>

The answer, of course, is no. The Due Process Clause requires that all punishments must be authorized by the relevant legislature. Legislatures regularly authorize imprisonment, even by different states, <i>see infra </i>note 56, but they do not and would not authorize basement-dungeon detention, or any other punishment dispensed by a non-state actor. The term “imprisonment” as it is used in statutes does not mean imprisonment in the abstract. Instead, “imprisonment” refers to a specific punishment in specific regulated conditions. For more analysis on the extent to which punishments can differ in terms, see <i>infra</i> Part II.B.2.</p></div>

<div class="full_footnote_inner"><p class="FootNote"><span> </span><span> </span>A similar argument can be made on different statutory grounds. 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a) governs how courts determine specific sentences. The statute requires courts to “impose a sentence sufficient, but not greater than necessary” to advance Congress’s interests in punishment. If courts were to take this seriously, they would have to consider the extent to which punishments previously dispensed could independently satisfy federal interests. <i>See </i>Steven F. Hubachek, <i>The Undiscovered </i>Apprendi<i>Revolution: The Sixth Amendment Consequences of an Ascendant Parsimony Provision</i>, 33 <span class="forced_sans_reg">Am. J.

While the parsimony provision is most prominent in federal sentencing guidelines, the idea that punishments should not be harsher than is necessary to advance those interests was recognized at common law and plays a role in state sentencing practices.</p></div>

<div class="full_footnote_number">45</div>
<div class="full_footnote_inner"><p class="FootNote"><span> </span><span> </span>One potential complication involves statutes that incorporate other laws by reference. Consider a fact pattern similar to <i>United States v. Dixon</i>, 509 U.S. 688 (1993). Suppose State <i>A</i> releases a defendant on bond subject to a court order that the defendant refrain from committing “any criminal offense.” Further suppose that the defendant violates the court order by committing a crime punishable by both State <i>A</i> and State <i>B</i>. If State <i>A</i> charges, convicts, and punishes the defendant for criminal contempt, would the defendant be entitled to a multiple punishment reduction if he is subsequently convicted by State <i>B</i> of the substantive crime underlying his contempt conviction?</p> <p class="FootNoteNewPara-Indent">In <i>Dixon</i>, the Supreme Court grappled with the question whether the two crimes (criminal contempt and the underlying substantive crime) should be considered the “same” under <i>Blockburger</i>. Under one reading, the two crimes are different: one contains elements involving drug trafficking, while the other contains elements involving the violation of a court order; both contain one element the other does not. Under another reading of <i>Blockburger</i>, however, the two crimes constitute the same offense: in order to convict the defendant of criminal contempt, the jury necessarily had to find that he was guilty of drug trafficking. Therefore, in application, the drug trafficking offense did not contain any element that the contempt offense did not. While the Supreme Court adopted the latter view, <i>id. </i>at 698, the holding was anything but clear; Justice Scalia’s majority opinion was accompanied by four other opinions: one adopted the competing view of <i>Blockburger</i>, <i>id. </i>at 717 (Rehnquist, C.J., concurring in part and dissenting in part); one disagreed with the Court’s view of <i>Blockburger</i>, arguing that the <i>Blockburger</i> test should apply in cases of multiple prosecution, but not cases of multiple punishment, <i>id. </i>at 735 (White, J., concurring in the judgment in part and dissenting in part); one argued that the <i>Blockburger</i> test should not be the sole test used to evaluate criminal contempt, <i>id. </i>at 741-42 (Blackmun, J., concurring in the judgment in part and dissenting in part) (noting that contempt of court is a “special situation”); and one argued that the <i>Blockburger</i> test does not adequately protect defendants from multiple prosecutions and that the case should have been resolved by the Court’s decision in <i>Grady v. Corbin</i>, 495 U.S. 508 (1990); <i>Dixon</i>, 509 U.S.<i></i>at 749, 757-58 (Souter, J., concurring in the judgment in part and dissenting in part).</p> <p class="FootNoteNewPara-Indent">Fortunately, the wrinkle created by statutes that incorporate other crimes by reference is one we can resolve easily. A court need not even consider whether two offenses are “the same” for the purposes of multiple punishments if the interests underlying those crimes are different. In the example posed above, it is clear that State <i>A</i>’s interest in prosecuting a criminal contempt violation is wholly (or almost wholly) orthogonal to its interest in prosecuting the underlying substantive offense—the former is to ensure citizens have proper respect for court orders and the terms of their pre-trial release, while the latter is to prevent the harms associated with drugs and drug smuggling. Accordingly, regardless of whether the offenses are the “same,” no sentence reduction would be appropriate. </p></div>

<div class="full_footnote_inner"><p class="FootNote"><span> </span><span> </span>One might argue that prison terms assigned by different sovereigns constitute different types of sentences—each sovereign operates its own corrections system and prison quality differs considerably from state to state. If a convict would have a substantially different incarceration experience in one facility than he would in another, then it is likely that the interests of a sentencing jurisdiction would be advanced at a different rate in each facility. In this way, incarceration in different prisons can be qualitatively different in the same way (though perhaps to a lesser extent) that a fine is qualitatively different from incarceration. As a result, one could argue that a prison sentence assigned by one sovereign would not necessarily have been approved by the legislature of another. </p> <p class="FootNoteNewPara-Indent">The problem with this argument is that it does not accurately reflect the way prisons and correctional facilities work.

<div class="full_footnote_inner"><p class="FootNote"><span> </span><span> </span><span>Of course, this type of gamesmanship is not without its risks. From the outset, it might be difficult to predict what will motivate a prosecutor. A defendant might angle to obtain a more severe punishment from one prosecutor (in an attempt to reduce his overall cumulative sentence) only to find that he miscalculated and will still be prosecuted by another. Similarly, a defendant could enter into a plea agreement with an incorrect understanding of the maximum cumulative penalty he could receive. In order to avoid these miscalculations, a defendant would likely enter into multi-sovereign plea negotiations to make sure he is not misled. At the very least, defendants would make these types of decisions only with the guidance and advice of their defense counsel who, like prosecutors, are repeat players and should have a sense of what would motivate potential prosecutors. </span></p></div>

United States, 355 U.S. 184, 187-88 (1957). For examples of cases where prosecutors from different jurisdictions have benefited from plea bargains and from the lack of protection from multiple prosecutions, see <i>Heath v. Alabama</i>, 474 U.S. 82 (1985), in which Alabama obtained a conviction and the death penalty after the defendant pleaded guilty to avoid the death penalty in Georgia; <i>United States v. Wheeler</i>, 435 U.S. 313 (1978), where the defendant pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct and contributing to delinquency of a minor, only to be charged by a different sovereign for statutory rape; <i>Abbate v.

It is the federal government, rather than the states, that has the power to regulate and respond to interstate problems. <span class="forced_sans_reg">U.S. Const. </span>art.

Intent can be inferred from a framework of regulation ‘so pervasive . . . that Congress left no room for the States to supplement it’ or where a ‘federal interest is so dominant that the federal system will be assumed to preclude enforcement of state laws on the same subject.’” (citations omitted) (quoting Rice v. Santa Fe Elevator Corp., 331 U.S. 218, 230 (1947))). While it is not altogether clear that the federal government’s regulation of interstate crime is “pervasive” enough to prevent state action, the scope of the federal criminal justice system and of the federal Commerce Clause power in general, for example, <i>Gonzales v. Raich</i>, 545 U.S. 1 (2005), suggests there is a case to be made.<i>See also</i> S. Ry. Co. v. R.R.

In this sense, the preclusion would not be absolute, as it is in the double jeopardy context where, as a matter of law, one prosecution precludes another.

<div class="full_footnote_inner"><p class="FootNote"><span> </span><span> </span>A discussion of mandatory minimum sentences might lead to an additional objection. One could argue that judges are required to adhere to mandatory minimum sentence guidelines and that, as a result, judges would have only a limited ability to reduce sentences (regardless of the punishment imposed by a previous sentencing sovereign). This objection has a very simple answer. When assigning a sentence, a judge need only incorporate the cumulative sentences assigned by other sovereigns for the same crime. As argued <i>supra </i>in Part II.B, when a judge reduces a sentence, he is really imputing a sentence from one jurisdiction to another. That is, the judge adopts the previous sentence as though it were his own. By imputing previous sentences in this way, judges can satisfy both mandatory minimum sentences <i>and </i>the Due Process Clause.</p></div>
