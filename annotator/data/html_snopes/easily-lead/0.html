<h1>Lead Poisoning</h1>
<h2>What is it and who is affected?</h2>
<p>Lead is a highly toxic substance, exposure to which can produce a wide range of 
					adverse health effects.  Both adults and children can suffer from the effects 
					of lead poisoning, but childhood lead poisoning is much more frequent.  Over the many 
					years since we have known about the hazards of lead, tens of millions of children 
					have suffered its health effects.  Even today, in 2004, there are still at minimum 
					more than four hundred thousand children under the age of six who have too much 
					lead in their blood.</p>
<h2>Where is it found?</h2>
<p>There are many ways in which humans are exposed to lead:  through deteriorating 
					paint, household dust, bare soil, air, drinking water, food, ceramics, home 
					remedies, hair dyes and other cosmetics.  Much of this lead is of microscopic size,
					invisible to the naked eye.  More often than not, children with elevated blood lead 
					levels are exposed to lead in their own home.</p>
<p><strong>By far the biggest source of concern is the lead paint that is found in 
					much of our nation's older housing.</strong>  Until 1978, lead paint 
					was commonly used on the interiors and exteriors of our homes.  Today, the US 
					Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) estimates that about 38 million 
					homes in the US still contain some lead paint.  While lead paint that is in 
					intact condition does not pose an immediate concern, lead paint that is allowed to
					deteriorate creates a lead-based paint hazard.  It can contaminate household dust 
					as well as bare soil around the house, where children may play.  In either situation, 
					a child who comes into contact with lead-contaminated dust or soil is easily poisoned.
					All it takes is hand-to-mouth activity, which is perfectly normal for young children 
					to engage in.  All it takes is the lead dust equivalent of a single grain of salt for 
					a child to register an elevated blood lead level.</p>
<p>According to HUD, about 25% of the nation's housing stock—some 24 million 
					homes—contains significant lead-based paint hazards, i.e. deteriorating 
					lead paint or lead-contaminated dust.  These are the homes producing the vast 
					majority of the childhood lead poisoning cases we see today.</p>
<p><strong>Children and adults too can get seriously lead poisoned when renovation and
					remodeling activities take place in a home that contains lead paint.</strong> Anytime 
					a surface containing lead paint is worked on, the debris and the dust created by the
					work must be contained and thoroughly cleaned up, and those doing the work must have 
					adequate personal protection to prevent them from breathing in any lead dust generated 
					by the work.  It is therefore of critical importance that lead painted surfaces be 
					identified prior to the commencement of any renovation or remodeling work, and that 
					lead-safe work practices are used during such activities.  Of course, steps must also 
					be taken to ensure that children, pets, and personal belongings including furniture 
					are protected from exposure to lead while work is ongoing, as well.</p>
<p>The past use of leaded gasoline, only recently banned in this country, contributed 
					greatly to the number of cases of childhood lead poisoning in the US during the last 
					sixty years or so.  The lead produced by vehicle emissions continues even today to 
					present a hazard, as much of that lead now remains in soil where it was deposited over 
					the years, especially near well-traveled roads and highways.  Children who play in 
					dirt contaminated by lead (whether that lead is from gasoline emissions or from 
					deteriorated house paint) can end up with lead-contaminated soil under their 
					fingernails or on their toys, or they can track it into their homes.  Even pets can 
					come into contact with lead-contaminated soil and cause human exposure to lead.  
					In each such case, an elevated blood lead level can easily result.</p>
<p>Drinking water can also sometimes contribute to elevated blood lead levels.  Lead 
					can leach into drinking water from certain types of plumbing materials (lead pipes, 
					copper pipes with lead solder, and brass faucets).  While water is usually not the 
					primary source of exposure to lead for children with elevated blood lead levels, it is 
					nevertheless important to note that formula-fed infants are at special risk of lead 
					poisoning, if their formula is made with lead-contaminated water.</p>
<h2>What are the health effects?</h2>
<p>There are many different health effects associated with elevated blood lead levels.
					<strong>Young children under the age of six</strong> are especially vulnerable to 
					lead's harmful health effects, because their brains and central nervous system are 
					still being formed.  For them, even very low levels of exposure can result in reduced 
					IQ, learning disabilities, attention deficit disorders, behavioral problems, stunted 
					growth, impaired hearing, and kidney damage.  At high levels of exposure, a child may 
					become mentally retarded, fall into a coma, and even die from lead poisoning.  Within 
					the last ten years, children have died from lead poisoning in New Hampshire and in 
					Alabama.  Lead poisoning has also been associated with juvenile delinquency and 
					criminal behavior.</p>
<p>In <strong>adults</strong>, lead can increase blood pressure and cause fertility 
					problems, nerve disorders, muscle and joint pain, irritability, and memory or 
					concentration problems.  It takes a significantly greater level of exposure to lead 
					for adults than it does for kids to sustain adverse health effects.  Most adults who 
					are lead poisoned get exposed to lead at work.  Occupations related to house 
					painting, welding, renovation and remodeling activities, smelters, firing ranges, the 
					manufacture and disposal of car batteries, and the maintenance and repair of bridges 
					and water towers, are particularly at risk for lead exposure.  Workers in these 
					occupations must also take care not to leave their work site with potentially 
					contaminated clothing, tools, and facial hair, or with unwashed hands.  Otherwise, 
					they can spread the lead to their family vehicles and ultimately to other family 
					members.</p>
<p>When a <strong>pregnant woman</strong> has an elevated blood lead level, that lead can 
					easily be transferred to the fetus, as lead crosses the placenta.  In fact, pregnancy 
					itself can cause lead to be released from the bone, where lead is stored—often 
					for decades—after it first enters the blood stream.  (The same process can occur 
					with the onset of menopause.)  Once the lead is released from the mother's bones, it 
					re-enters the blood stream and can end up in the fetus.  In other words, if a woman had
					been exposed to enough lead as a child for some of the lead to have been stored in her 
					bones, the mere fact of pregnancy can trigger the release of that lead and can cause 
					the fetus to be exposed.  In such cases, the baby is born with an elevated blood 
					lead level.</p>
<p>Exposure to lead is estimated by measuring levels of lead in the blood (in micrograms 
					of lead per deciliter of blood).  The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
					(CDC) has set a "level of concern" for children at 10 micrograms per deciliter.  At 
					this level, it is generally accepted that adverse health effects can begin to set in.  
					However, recent research published in the New England Journal of Medicine provides new 
					evidence that there could well be very harmful effects occurring at even lower 
					levels of exposure, even as low as 5 micrograms of lead per deciliter of blood.  In 
					other words, science is now telling us that there is in fact no level of lead exposure 
					that can be considered safe.</p>
<h2>How can I check my home to see if it contains lead-based paint hazards?</h2>
<p>If you live in a home built before 1960, it is very likely that it contains some lead 
					paint.  Homes built between 1960 and 1978 may also contain lead paint, but they are 
					less and less likely to, the closer you get to 1978, when the Consumer Product Safety 
					Commission finally issued its ban against lead-based paint.  If you live in a home 
					built before 1978 that also has been allowed to deteriorate for a few years, you may 
					have a lead-contaminated dust problem.  To find out if your home contains lead paint 
					or a lead-based paint hazard, you should hire a professional.</p>
<p>If all you want to do is find out if there is lead paint in your home, you should 
					hire a lead inspector to test all the paint.  Depending on the size of your home, 
					this normally takes between one and four hours.  You will know the results of the 
					inspection on the spot.  The inspector will be able to tell you whether or not there 
					is lead paint in the home, where it is, and the concentration of lead in 
					the paint.  (Older homes contain higher concentrations of lead in paint than homes 
					built after the early 1950s.  The higher the concentration, the greater the hazard 
					once the paint deteriorates.)</p>
<p>If you also want to find out if your home contains any lead-contaminated dust, 
					which is the most dangerous of all lead-based paint hazards, you should hire either a 
					risk assessor or a sampling technician.  They will take samples of dust throughout your 
					home and then send them to a laboratory for analysis.  You should be able to learn the 
					results within three to seven days.  You will learn whether there is any 
					lead-contaminated dust in your home and where it was found.  A risk assessor can 
					also tell you what you should do next to take care of the problem.  Alternatively, 
					you can buy a dust sampling kit and carefully do the sampling yourself, send the 
					samples to an appropriate laboratory for analysis, and get the results directly from 
					the lab.  This is a less expensive way to find out about lead-contaminated dust in 
					your home.  <strong>The National Safety Council offers a lead dust test kit that includes 
					everything a consumer needs to determine the presence of lead dust in their home, 
					including detailed instructions and a pre-stamped, pre-addressed envelope to the lab 
					for sample analysis. 
					<a href="/web/20060202101711/http://www.nsc.org/issues/lead/OrderFormLeadKits.pdf">Download an order form</a>.</strong></p>
<p>Various manufacturers also offer what is called a "spot test kit," basically a 
					sampling tool that uses a chemical process to help consumers figure out if there is 
					lead present in household paint, or even on ceramicware or on toys.  However, spot 
					test kits are not considered completely reliable tools in terms of their accuracy, and 
					they should not be relied upon for definitive answers regarding the presence of lead 
					paint.</p>

					hazard evaluation and control activities, proceed to the Lead Listing at

<h2>What are some simple steps to take to prevent or reduce lead exposure?</h2>
<p><strong>Maintain the paint in your home and clean up any lead dust.</strong> If you 
					live in a home built before 1978, the most important step to take to reduce the risk 
					of exposure to lead is to make sure that the paint is well maintained.  Whenever 
					repainting, renovation, or other work is undertaken that may end up disturbing a 
					painted surface, it is critical to moisten the surface first, in order to prevent 
					the work from generating dust.  Similarly, all painted debris from the work should be 
					contained, in other words prevented from spreading beyond the area where the debris 
					can be carefully gathered and then safely disposed of.</p>
<p>If you think you may have a lead dust problem, you can clean up lead-contaminated 
					dust yourself by carefully and thoroughly washing the area, using soapy water and a 
					mop.  A three-bucket system is ideal, with one bucket holding the soapy water (a 
					general all-purpose cleaner is adequate, but dishwasher soap containing phosphates 
					or a lead-specific detergent may be more effective), a second bucket serving as the 
					rinse bucket, and the third containing only clean water.  After you wash a 
					section of floor with the soapy water, rinse the mop in the rinse bucket, then dunk 
					it in the clean water bucket, and finally dip it back in the soapy water bucket before 
					cleaning the next area.  For smaller areas such as window sills, a rag should be used 
					instead of a mop.  Once done, throw the mop or rag away.  <strong>Whenever cleaning 
					lead-contaminated dust, vigorous wiping is most effective in removing the lead.  
					However, wiping should never be done in a back-and-forth manner, but rather from left 
					to right (or vise-versa), or from the top of a wall downwards.</strong></p>
<p>Once cleaning has been completed for a given room, it is time to rinse, using only 
					clean water and preferably a new mop head.</p>
<p>Remember that if you do have a lead dust problem, you will also need to address the 
					source of the lead dust.  In many instances, lead dust particles are generated by 
					friction caused by the opening and shutting of old windows.  With old, deteriorating 
					windows, outright window replacement may be the best option.  In addition to solving 
					your lead dust problem, this also typically results in significantly increased energy 
					efficiency, higher property values, and lower heating and cooling bills.</p>
<p>If you have a young child in your home and you suspect there may be a lead problem, 
					take the recommended steps to eliminate any lead-contaminated dust, and make sure the 
					child washes his/her hands frequently.  Also make sure to clean any toys that have been 
					lying about in areas that you suspect may contain lead-contaminated dust.</p>
<p><strong>Check the water.</strong>  To ensure your drinking water does not contain a 
					hazardous level of lead, test the water at your faucets.  Call the EPA Safe Drinking 
					Water Hotline at 800-426-4791 for more information.  Kits for testing water, along with 
					the instructions for doing so, are available from a number of providers.</p>
<p><strong>Eat right.</strong> The amount of lead the human body retains can be reduced 
					if you make sure your child's diet includes plenty of foods that contain iron, calcium 
					and zinc.  Foods rich in iron include eggs, raisins, greens, beans, peas, and other 
					legumes.  Dairy products such as milk, cheese, and yogurt are recommended for their 
					high calcium content.  Lean red meat and oysters are examples of foods that contain 
					zinc.  Avoid giving children fried or fatty foods—although remember that a certain 
					amount of dietary fat is vital for children under two years of age.  And make sure your 
					children always wash their hands before eating.</p>
<p><strong>Check your ceramic ware.</strong>  Some pottery may contain lead that can leach 
					into food and drinks.  Avoid eating off any colorfully painted ceramic plates, and 
					avoid drinking from any ceramic mugs unless you know they do not leach lead.  This 
					is particularly important if the pottery was made in Mexico or another Latin America 
					country, or in Asia.  Generally, pottery made in the US, in Canada, or in Western 
					Europe tends to be safe.</p>
<p><strong>Do not store alcohol in crystal containers.</strong>  Crystal decanters and 
					glasses are often made with lead.  When an acidic substance or alcohol is left in 
					these containers for longer than just a few hours, there is a risk that the lead could 
					leach into the liquid.</p>
<p><strong>Cover bare soil play areas.</strong>  You should ensure your child avoids 
					playing in bare soil areas unless you know they are lead free.  Often, bare soil will 
					contain some lead, either deposited there by vehicle emissions from leaded gasoline 
					days, or from deteriorated exterior paint.  This is frequently the case in vacant lots, 
					where old buildings once stood, or in a neighborhood where extensive renovation work 
					may have occurred.  If you have a bare soil problem, the easiest way to 
					reduce the risk is to cover the soil with mulch (for instance, pebbles, shrubbery, or 
					grass).  A child who plays in lead-contaminated bare soil is likely to get some under 
					his/her fingernails, which will eventually find their way into his/her mouth, or 
					on toys, or on their shoes, which could track the lead into the home.  Similarly, a 
					dog that rolls around in lead-contaminated bare soil may end up transporting some of 
					that lead into the home.</p>
<h2>What laws help prevent lead poisoning?</h2>
<p>At the Federal level, the Lead-Based Paint Hazard Reduction Act of 1992, known as 
					Title X (Title ten), is the source of much of the law of the land on lead paint.  One 
					of its most important requirements is the disclosure of known lead hazards at the time 
					of the sale or lease of a home built before 1978.  Sellers and landlords must also 
					provide a pamphlet on lead poisoning to the buyer or renter before the pre-1978 property 
					is sold or rented.</p>
<p>The Federal lead hazard disclosure laws have been vigorously enforced by the US 
					Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), the US Environmental Protection 
					Agency (EPA), and the US Department of Justice (DOJ).  For the past five years, these 
					Federal agencies have been working closely together to help ensure that property 
					owners and real estate agents comply with the Title X disclosure requirements.</p>
<p>Similarly, Title X also requires renovators, remodelers, and others who conduct such 
					activities for compensation in homes built before 1978 to provide the pamphlet entitled 
					Protect Your Family From Lead in Your Home to the owners and occupants of 
					affected housing, prior to beginning the work.</p>
<p>At the state or local level, your state or municipality may have enacted additional 
					laws to protect you from lead poisoning.  Check with your state and local health and 
					housing departments for details.</p>
<p>Code enforcement is another important legal tool that can be used to prevent lead 
					poisoning.  Most local codes already prohibit chipping, peeling paint conditions.</p>
<p>Generally, under what is called "common law," tenants have a right to live in safe 
					housing, otherwise known as the implied warranty of habitability.  Premises that 
					contain lead-based paint hazards are inherently unsafe places to live.  If you can 
					demonstrate that your rented home contains a lead-based paint hazard, you should 
					immediately contact your landlord or property manager and notify them of the presence 
					of a lead hazard.  Do it in writing and keep a dated copy for your records. 
					If they fail to respond in a timely and effective manner to this notification, you 
					may have legal recourse against them.  Consult an attorney for further 
					information—and take your own precautions.</p>
