	LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGEST


   SB 1613, Simitian  Vehicles: wireless telephones.
   Under existing law, motor vehicle operation is regulated, and
drivers must follow many legal requirements or face criminal
sanctions. Under existing law, it is a crime for a person to drive a
schoolbus or transit vehicle while using a wireless telephone, except
for certain work-related or emergency purposes.
   This bill would make it an infraction, operative July 1, 2008, to
drive a motor vehicle while using a wireless telephone, unless that
telephone is designed and configured to allow hands-free listening
and talking operation, and is used in that manner while driving. This
offense would be punishable by a base fine of $20 for a first
offense and $50 for each subsequent offense.
   The bill would provide that this prohibition does not apply to a
person who is using the cellular telephone to contact a law
enforcement agency or public safety entity for emergency purposes, or
to an emergency services professional while he or she operates an
authorized emergency vehicle, as specified. The bill also would
prohibit the assignment of a violation point for a violation of the
above.
   The bill, until July 1, 2011, also would provide that this
prohibition does not apply to a person when using a digital 2-way
radio service that utilizes a wireless telephone that operates by
depressing a push-to-talk feature and does not require immediate
proximity to the ear of the user, and that person is driving a motor
truck or truck tractor, as respectively defined, a listed or
described implement of husbandry, a listed farm vehicle, a tow truck,
or a commercial vehicle, as defined, used in commercial agricultural
operations.
   The bill would specify that these provisions do not apply to a
person driving a schoolbus or transit vehicle that is subject to
certain existing wireless telephone usage restrictions, and would
specify that the restrictions contained in this bill do not apply to
a person while driving a motor vehicle on private property.
   By creating a new infraction, this bill would impose a
state-mandated local program.
  The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local
agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the
state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that
reimbursement.
   This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this
act for a specified reason.
