<h3>WHAT IS CHOLINESTERASE?</h3>
Cholinesterase (ko-li-nes-ter-ace) is one of many important
enzymes needed for the proper functioning of the nervous systems of
humans, other vertebrates, and insects.  Certain chemical classes of
pesticides, such as organophosphates (OPs) and carbamates (CMs) work
against undesirable bugs by interfering with, or 'inhibiting'
cholinesterase.  While the effects of cholinesterase inhibiting
products are intended for insect pests, these chemicals can also be
poisonous, or toxic, to humans in some situations.
<p>Human exposure to cholinesterase inhibiting chemicals can
result from inhalation, ingestion, or eye or skin contact during
the manufacture, mixing, or applications of these pesticides.
</p><h3>HOW DOES IT WORK?</h3>
Electrical switching centers, called 'synapses' are found
throughout the nervous systems of humans, other vertebrates, and
insects.  Muscles, glands, and nerve fibers called 'neurons' are
stimulated or inhibited by the constant firing of signals across
these synapses.  Stimulating signals are usually carried by a
chemical called 'acetylcholine' (a-see-till-ko-leen). 
Stimulating signals are discontinued by a specific type of
cholinesterase enzyme, acetylcholinesterase, which breaks down
the acetylcholine.  These important chemical reactions are
usually going on all the time at a very fast rate, with
acetylcholine causing stimulation and acetylcholinesterase ending
the signal.  If cholinesterase-affecting insecticides are present
in the synapses, however, this situation is thrown out of
balance.  The presence of cholinesterase inhibiting chemicals
prevents the breakdown of acetylcholine.  Acetylcholine can then
build up, causing a "jam" in the nervous system.  Thus, when a
person receives to great an exposure to cholinesterase inhibiting
compounds, the body is unable to break down the acetylcholine.
<p>Let us look at a typical synapse in the body's nervous
system, in which a muscle is being directed by a nerve to move. 
An electrical signal, or nerve impulse, is conducted by
acetylcholine across the junction between the nerve and the
muscle (the synapse) stimulating the muscle to move.   Normally,
after the appropriate response is accomplished, cholinesterase is
released which breaks down the acetylcholine terminating the
stimulation of the muscle.  The enzyme acetylcholine accomplishes
this by chemically breaking the compound into other compounds and
removing them from the nerve junction.  If acetylcholinesterase
is unable to breakdown or remove acetylcholine, the muscle can
continue to move uncontrollably.
</p><p>Electrical impulses can fire away continuously unless the
number of messages being sent through the synapse is limited by
the action of cholinesterase.  Repeated and unchecked firing of
electrical signals can cause uncontrolled, rapid twitching of
some muscles, paralyzed breathing, convulsions, and in extreme
cases, death.  This is summarized below.
</p><p>
Exposure to:
</p><ul>
<li>carbamates
	</li><li>organophosphates
	</li><li>chlorinated derivatives of nicotine
</li></ul>
<p>
May result in:
</p><ul>
<li>build-up of acetylcholine
	</li><li>cholinesterase inhibition
	</li><li>constant firing of electrical messages
	</li><li>potential symptoms of:  twitching, trembling, paralyzed breathing, convulsions, and in extreme cases, death.
</li></ul>
<h3>WHICH PESTICIDES CAN INHIBIT CHOLINESTERASE?</h3>
Any pesticide that can bind, or inhibit, cholinesterase,
making it unable to breakdown acetylcholine, is called a
"cholinesterase inhibitor," or "anticholinesterase agent."  The
two main classes of cholinesterase inhibiting pesticides are the
organophosphates (OPs) and the carbamates (CMs).  Some newer
chemicals, such as the chlorinated derivatives of nicotine can
also affect the cholinesterase enzyme.
<p>Organophosphate insecticides include some of the most toxic
pesticides.  They can enter the human body through skin
absorption, inhalation and ingestion.  They can affect
cholinesterase activity in both red blood cells and in blood
plasma, and can act directly, or in combination with other
enzymes, on cholinesterase in the body.  The following list

<h3>WHAT HAPPENS AS A RESULT OF OVEREXPOSURE TO CHOLINESTERASE
INHIBITING PESTICIDES?</h3>
Overexposure to organophosphate and carbamate insecticides
can result in cholinesterase inhibition.  These pesticides
combine with acetylcholinesterase at nerve endings in the brain
and nervous system, and with other types of cholinesterase found
in the blood.  This allows acetylcholine to build up, while
protective levels of the cholinesterase enzyme  decrease. The
more cholinesterase levels decrease, the more likely symptoms of
poisoning from cholinesterase inhibiting pesticides are to show.
<p>Signs and symptoms of cholinesterase inhibition from
exposure to CMs or OPs include the following:</p><p>
</p><ol type="a">
<li>In mild cases (within 4 - 24 hours of contact): tiredness,
weakness, dizziness, nausea and blurred vision;<p>
</p></li><li>In moderate cases (within 4 - 24 hours of contact):
headache, sweating, tearing, drooling, vomiting, tunnel vision,
and twitching;<p>
</p></li><li>In severe cases (after continued daily absorption): 
abdominal cramps, urinating, diarrhea, muscular tremors,
staggering gait, pinpoint pupils, hypotension (abnormally low
blood pressure), slow heartbeat, breathing difficulty, and
possibly death, if not promptly treated by a physician.
</li></ol>
<p>Unfortunately, some of the above symptoms can be confused
with influenza (flu), heat prostration, alcohol intoxication,
exhaustion, hypoglycemia (low blood sugar), asthma,
gastroenteritis, pneumonia, and brain hemorrhage.  This can cause
problems if the symptoms of lowered cholinesterase levels are
either ignored or misdiagnosed as something more or less harmful
than they really are.
</p><p>The types and severity of cholinesterase inhibition symptoms
depend on:
</p><p>
</p><ol type="a">
<li>the toxicity of the pesticide.
	</li><li>the amount of pesticide involved in the exposure.
	</li><li>the route of exposure.
	</li><li>the duration of exposure.
</li></ol>
<p>Although the signs of cholinesterase inhibition are similar
for both carbamate and organophosphate poisoning, blood
cholinesterase returns to safe levels much more quickly after
exposure to CMs than after OP exposure.  Depending on the degree
of exposure, cholinesterase levels may return to pre-exposure
levels after a period ranging from several hours to several days
for carbamate exposure, and from a few days to several weeks for
organophosphates.
</p><p>When symptoms of decreased cholinesterase levels first
appear, it is impossible to tell whether a poisoning will be mild
or severe.  In many instances, when the skin is contaminated,
symptoms can quickly go from mild to severe even though the area
is washed.  Certain chemicals can continue to be absorbed through
the skin in spite of cleaning efforts.
</p><p>If someone experiences any of these symptoms, especially a
combination of four or more of these symptoms during pesticide
handling or through other sources of exposure, they should
immediately remove themselves from possible further exposure.     
Work should not be started again until first aid or medical
attention is given and the work area has been decontaminated. 
Work practices, possible sources of exposure, and protective
precautions should also be carefully examined.
</p><p>The victim of poisoning should be transported to the nearest
hospital or poison center at the first sign(s) of poisoning. 
Atropine and pralidoxime (2-PAM, Protopam) chloride may be given
by the physician for organophosphate poisoning; atropine is the
only antidote needed to treat cholinesterase inhibition resulting
from carbamate exposure (<a href="http://pmep.cce.cornell.edu/#9">9</a>).
</p><h3>WHY MONITOR CHOLINESTERASE?</h3>
Anyone exposed to cholinesterase-affected pesticides can
develop lowered cholinesterase levels.  The purpose of regular
checking of cholinesterase levels is to alert the exposed person
to any change in the level of this essential enzyme before it can
cause serious illness.  Ideally, a pre-exposure baseline
cholinesterase value should be established for any individual
before they come in regular contact with organophosphates and
carbamates.  Fortunately, the breakdown of cholinesterase can be
reversed and cholinesterase levels will return to normal if
pesticide exposure is stopped.
<h3>WHAT IS THE CHOLINESTERASE TEST?</h3>
Humans have three types of cholinesterase:  red blood cell
(RBC) cholinesterase, called "true cholinesterase;" plasma
cholinesterase, called "pseudocholinesterase;" and brain
cholinesterase.  Red blood cell cholinesterase is the same enzyme
that is found in the nervous system, while plasma cholinesterase
is made in the liver.
<p>When a cholinesterase blood test is taken, two types of
cholinesterase can be detected.  Physicians find plasma
cholinesterase readings helpful for detecting the early, acute
effects of organophosphate poisoning, while red blood cell
readings are useful in evaluating long-term, or chronic, exposure
(<a href="http://pmep.cce.cornell.edu/#8">8</a>).
</p><p>The cholinesterase test is a blood test used to measure the
effect of exposure to certain or cholinesterase-affected
insecticides.  Both plasma (or serum) and red blood cell (RBC)
cholinesterase should be tested. These two tests have different
meanings and the combined report is needed by the physician for a
complete understanding of the individual's particular
cholinesterase situation.
</p><p>Laboratory methods for cholinesterase testing differ
greatly, and results obtained by one method cannot be easily
compared with results obtained by another.  Sometimes there is
also considerable variation in test results between laboratories
using the same testing method.  Whenever possible, cholinesterase
monitoring for an individual should be performed in the same
laboratory, using a consistent testing method.
</p><p>The approved methods are:  Michel, microMichel, pH stat,
Ellman, micro-Ellman, and certain variations of these.  Micro
methods have the advantage of not necessitating venipuncture, the
drawing of blood from a vein by puncturing the vein with a needle
attached to a collecting tube.  The Ellman technique is
considered better for detecting cholinesterase inhibition caused
by carbamates.  Many of the various "kit" methods in use are not
satisfactory, particularly those which can be used only for
plasma (or serum) determinations.
</p><h3>WHO NEEDS TO BE TESTED?</h3>
The following people should be concerned with having their
cholinesterase levels checked on a regular basis:  (a) anyone
that mixes, loads, applies, or expects to handle or come in
contact with highly or moderately toxic organophosphate and/or
carbamate pesticides (this includes anyone servicing equipment
used in the process); (b) anyone that is in contact with these
chemicals for more than 30 hours at a time in one 30-day period.
<h3>WHEN SHOULD SOMEONE BE TESTED AND HOW OFTEN?</h3>
Every person has his/her own individual 'normal' range of
baseline cholinesterase values; cholinesterase levels vary
greatly within an individual, between individuals, between test
laboratories, and between test methods.
<p>The extent of potential pesticide poisoning can be better
understood if cholinesterase tests taken after exposure to the
cholinesterase inhibiting pesticides can be compared to the
individual's baseline, pre-exposure measurement.  Workers that
receive routine exposure to organophosphate or carbamate
pesticides should be offered an initial pre-employment check of
their blood cholinesterase levels to establish "baseline values"
prior to any exposure to these agrochemicals.  If no pre-exposure
value was obtained, however, the earliest cholinesterase value
recorded can be used for later comparison.  Excessive exposure to
OPs and CMs depresses the cholinesterase so markedly that a
diagnosis can also be made without previous baseline testing.  If
an individual's cholinesterase levels drop 30 percent below the
original baseline level, immediate retesting should be done.
</p><p>While there is no set formula for deciding the frequency of
cholinesterase testing, in general, the initial baseline test
should be followed by subsequent cholinesterase testing on a
regular (usually monthly) basis.  This testing should be done
weekly during the active season, however, when workers are
employed full-time and regularly using OPs and CMs labelled
"DANGER."  The test should be repeated any time a worker becomes
sick while working with OPs, or within 12 hours of his/her last
exposure.
</p><p>Several factors should be considered in deciding how often
someone should have his/her cholinesterase levels tested:
</p><p>
</p><ol type="a">
<li>The extent and seriousness of the possible exposure.  This
will vary with the toxicity of the pesticides being used and how
often they are handled.<p>
</p></li><li>The type of work being done and the equipment being used may
involve different risks of exposure.<p>
</p></li><li>Work practices have an important effect on worker safety. 
Some good practices include: the proper use of protective
clothing and equipment; showering after each job; avoidance of
drinking, eating and smoking in pesticide contaminated areas;
prompt and effective decontamination in the event of spills.<p>
</p></li><li>The past safety record of a company and the work history and
experience of an individual.<p>
</p></li><li>The physician's experience and familiarity with a specific
work force may be an additional factor.
</li></ol>
<h3>HOW DOES SOMEONE GET TESTED?</h3>
Since individual states vary in their cholinesterase
monitoring programs, people that want to get their cholinesterase
levels checked should consult with either their family or company
physician for the specific requirements and procedures for
cholinesterase testing in their particular state.  After the
blood is sampled and tested, test results are sent to the
individual and his/her physician for interpretation.
<p>Baseline blood samples should be taken at a time when the
worker has not been exposed to organophosphate and carbamate
pesticides for at least 30 days.  Establishing a stable baseline
requires a minimum of two pre-exposure tests taken at least 3
days but not more than 14 days apart.  If these two tests differ
by as much as 20 percent, a third sample should be taken and the
two closest values averaged and considered the true baseline.
</p><h3>WHAT ARE THE LIMITS OF CHOLINESTERASE TESTING?</h3>
While cholinesterase testing is extremely valuable, it does
have its limits, for the following reasons:  (a) not all
hospitals are set up to complete the test within one facility,
causing delays in diagnosis; (b) the wide statistical error of
the test makes it difficult to accurately detect very slight
poisoning from cholinesterase inhibiting pesticides; (c) the
blood test is more effective in detecting cholinesterase
depression from OP exposure than it is in detecting
cholinesterase inhibition from carbamate exposure.
<p>While carbamates (CMs) cause a depression in cholinesterase
levels, the enzyme levels may return to baseline levels within
hours of exposure, perhaps before test results are returned. 
When the effects of over-exposure to CMs are being checked, blood
must be drawn during actual exposure or not more than 4 hours
thereafter.  If the drawing of blood and the actual completion of
the laboratory test is delayed for more than 4 hours,
reactivation of the enzyme will have taken place in the blood. 
This situation makes it hard for the physician to know the extent
to which cholinesterase was inhibited, and to fully assess the
seriousness of any safety problems which might exist in the work
environment.
</p><h3>HOW ARE  THE TESTS INTERPRETED?</h3>
The interpretation of cholinesterase test results should be
done by a physician.  A 15 to 25 percent depression in
cholinesterase means that slight poisoning has taken place.  A 25
to 35 percent drop signals moderate poisoning, and a 35 to 50
percent decline in the cholinesterase readings indicates severe
poisoning (<a href="http://pmep.cce.cornell.edu/#8">8</a>).
<p>A reported change in an individual's cholinesterase level
may result from something other than a pesticide exposure, or it
may be the result of laboratory error, but this should never be
assumed to be the case.  If the report shows a worker's
cholinesterase level has dropped 20 percent below his/her
baseline in either plasma or RBC, he/she should be retested
immediately.  If the second test repeats the same low values,
faulty work practices should be carefully looked for and steps
should be taken to correct them.
</p><p>A 30 percent drop below the individual's baseline of RBC
cholinesterase or plasma cholinesterase means that the individual
should be removed from all exposure to organophosphates and
carbamates, with the individual not being allowed to return until
both levels return to the pre-exposure baseline range.  Removal
from exposure means avoidance of areas where the materials are
handled or mixed and avoidance of any contact with open
containers or with equipment that is used for mixing, dusting or
spraying organophosphates or carbamates.  A worker removed from
exposure to cholinesterase inhibitors may be employed at other
types of work.
</p><h3>WHERE CAN ONE GET TESTED AND WHAT IS THE COST OF THE TEST?</h3>
Because of the lack of approval of standardized test methods
and laboratories in the U.S., a list of approved laboratories is
not available.  However, consult with your physician or local
community hospital (testing laboratory) and the State Department
of Health for guidance and recommendation of a good laboratory. 
Keep in mind that a single test method at one test laboratory
should be used in your monitoring program.
<p>The 1986 estimates on the cost of individual cholinesterase
tests range from $7.00 to $60.00, with the average test costing
approximately $35.00.  The quality of tests will improve and
prices will be lowered if and when testing methods are
standardized and automated.
</p><h3>WHAT IS THE CURRENT STATUS OF CHOLINESTERASE SURVEILLANCE
PROGRAMS?</h3>
Current EPA worker protection standards (put into place in
1974) are incomplete, and more comprehensive rules are being
proposed which would be put into effect in the Spring of 1988. 
The standards address reentry intervals, notification,
decontamination facilities, training of workers, and emergency
medical care for workers.  Additional provisions are also
specified on protective equipment, change facilities, medical
monitoring, annual physical examinations, and maintaining contact
during pesticide handling.  These regulations are likely to
require commercial pesticide applicators to have cholinesterase
blood tests to establish individual baseline readings. 
Applicators would then be required to have another test for every
3 or more consecutive days of exposure to organophosphates which
fall in toxicity category I ("highly toxic") or category II
("moderately toxic") or when exposed six or more days in a 21-day
period.  Four states currently have some type of cholinesterase
testing requirement in place: California, Ohio, Arizona, and
Colorado.
