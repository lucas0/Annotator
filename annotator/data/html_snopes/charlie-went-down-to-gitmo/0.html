<p><b>The Straight Scoop</b></p>
<p><b> I’ve just returned from Guantanamo Bay, Cuba Naval Air Station base 
        where we did three shows for the troops and toured several locations around 
        the post visiting with some of the finest military personnel on planet 
        earth. The kids seemed to really enjoy the shows and especially liked 
        “This Ain’t No Rag, It’s A Flag” and “In America”. We had a great time 
        with them. We saw Camp X-Ray, where the Taliban detainees are being held 
        only from a distance, but I picked up a lot of what’s going on there from 
        talking with a lot of different people. The truth of the matter is that 
        this operation is under a microscope. The Red Cross has an on site presence 
        there and watches everything that goes on very closely. The media is not 
        telling you the whole truth about what’s going on over there. The truth 
        is that these scum bags are not only being treated humanely, but they 
        are probably better off healthwise and medically than they’ve ever been 
        in their lives They are fed well, able to take showers and receive state 
        of the art medical care. And have their own Moslem chaplain. I saw several 
        of them in a field hospital ward where they were being treated in a state 
        of the art medical facility. Now let’s talk about the way they treat our 
        people. First of all, they have to be watched constantly. These people 
        are committed and wanton murderers who are willing to die just to kill 
        someone else. One of the doctors told me that when they had Taliban in 
        the hospital the staff had to really be careful with needles, pens and 
        anything else which could possibly be used as a weapon. They also throw 
        their excrement and urine on the troops who are guarding them. And our 
        guys and gals have shown great restrain in not retaliating. We are spending 
        over a million dollars a day maintaining and guarding these nasty killers 
        and anyone who wants to see them brought to the U.S.A. for trial is either 
        out of their heads or a lawyer looking for money and notoriety. Or both. 
        I wish that the media and the Red Cross and all the rest of the people 
        who are so worried about these criminals would realize that this is not 
        a troop of errant Boy Scouts. These are killers of the worst kind. They 
        don’t need protection from us, we need protection from them. If you don’t 
        get anything else out of this soapbox, please try to realize that when 
        you see news coverage much of the time you’re not getting the whole story, 
        but an account filtered through a liberal mindset with an agenda. We have 
        two fights on our hands, the war against terror and the one against the 
        loudmouthed lawyers and left wing media who would sap the strength from 
        the American public by making us believe that we’re losing the war or 
        doing something wrong in fighting it. Remember these are the same people 
        who told us that Saddam Hussein's Republican guard was going to be an 
        all but invincible enemy and that our smart bombs and other weapons were 
        not really as good as the military said that they were. They also took 
        up for Bill Clinton while he was cavorting around the Oval office with 
        Monica Lewinsky while the terrorists were gaining strength and bombing 
        our Embassies and dragging the bodies of dead American heroes around the 
        dusty streets of Somalia. It’s a shame that we can’t have an unbiased 
        media who would just report the truth and let us make up our own minds. 
        Here I must commend Fox News for presenting both sides much better than 
        the other networks. They are leaving the other cable networks in the dust. 
        People like being told the truth. Our military not only needs but deserves 
        our support. Let’s give it to them. The next time you read a media account 
        about the bad treatment of the Taliban in Cuba, remember what I told you. 
        Been there done that. Footnote: I got an e-mail from a rather irate first 
        cousin of mine the other day who has a daughter who’s a lawyer and she 
        seemed to think that I was painting all lawyers with the same brush. Please 
        understand that I’m not doing that at all. That would be like saying that 
        all musicians were drug addicts. There are a lot of good and honest attorneys 
        out there. I happen to have one of them. But it seems that they never 
        get any airtime. It’s always the radicals who get their opinions heard. 
        Who fight the idea of the military tribunals and site The Constitution 
        and the integrity of America as their source of justifying their opinions. 
        Well, first of all The Constitution says ” We the people of the United 
        States”, it doesn’t mention any other country. And secondly as far as 
        integrity is concerned, I don’t think some of these folks would know integrity 
        if it bit them in the posterior. </b></p>
