<h1>Notes</h1>
<p>I-95 has some very weird spur routes in New England.  In any other 
part of the country I-495 in MA would probably be a two digit highway.  
</p><p>I 95 was originally supposed to go through Boston instead of around 
it, but locals nixed the idea.  Apparently you still can find small 
stretches of that road if you know where to look.   </p><p> If you were 
wondering what happens to I-95 through New Jersey, the following post 
from misc.transport.road might explain things:

&gt; If the weather's good enough, I was planning to drive from Washington<br/>
&gt; to New York during a trip in January.  I assumed that I could take I-95<br/>
&gt; all the way, but my atlas shows a break in the route between Trenton 
and<br/>
&gt; New York.  What happened here?  Are they planning to complete the route?
</p><p>
One of my favorite subjects...
</p><p>
The large freeway which was supposed to carry I-95 through central New Jersey
was cancelled after fierce opposition from wealthy folks in western Somerset
and northern Mercer Counties... especially in Hopewell Township in northern
Mercer County, which was directly in I-95's projected path.  
</p><p>
I-95 southbound was supposed to leave the New Jersey Turnpike at Exit 10
(I-287), share I-287 west until (roughly) South Plainfield, then split 
off and
run parallel to and a few miles south of I-287 until about Somerset 
(I-695 was
supposed to connect I-287 and I-95 around there), then go directly southwest
through the rich areas (crossing US 206 near Hopewell) to the current
intersection of I-95 northbound and I-295 southbound.
</p><p>
Instead, I-95 southbound goes to NJTP Exit 10 and vanishes into thin air 
(from
there, the NJTP southbound calls itself "To I-95"... the NJTP ends at I-295,
which crosses the Delaware Memorial Bridge and meets I-95 in suburban
Wilmington, DE).  I-95 northbound goes to its intersection with I-295 and
vanishes into grassy oblivion about ten miles southwest of where it would 
have
intersected US 206 (a few hundred yards of I-95, now overgrown, are visible
beyond the I-95/I-295 intersection).
(Note: since this post was sent out, the I-95/I-295 intersection has been 
moved a few miles to coincide with the US 1 exit.)


</p><p>
In my opinion, this part of central New Jersey could have become one of the
USA's most important "edge cities", but its development was stunted by the
cancellation of I-95 and the concomitant overcrowding of the nearby US 1
corridor... which leads to a good trivia question:
</p><p>
Is there a direct all-freeway route between New York and Philadelphia?
</p><p>
No!
</p><p>
I-95 would have been such a route (though the part on the NJTP would have 
been
toll... I meant limited-access, not free of toll)...  but, after it was
cancelled, both the NJ and PA Turnpike authorities were asked at various 
times
(and declined, due to expense and/or projected loss of toll revenue) to add
exits (e.g., NJTP south to I-76 west, I-276 west to I-95 south, I-276 
west to
I-295 south) to create such a route.
</p><p>
&gt; Also, if anyone has any suggestions for the best route, according to<br/>
&gt; shortest time, best scenery, etc., please let me know.  I'll be driving<br/>
&gt; on a Thursday.
</p><p>
The standard route is to take I-95 north to downtown Baltimore through the
Fort McHenry Tunnel (if the electronic warning signs tell you the tunnel is
closed by accidents, take the Harbor Tunnel Thruway, which is normally 
worse).</p><p>
At the edge of the Baltimore metro area, I-95 north becomes a toll highway
(called the JFK highway in Maryland and the Delaware Turnpike in Delaware).
Stay on I-95 north until you get to suburban Wilmington, Delaware, where you
take I-295 east (north?) across the Delaware Memorial Bridge to New Jersey.
From there, you can take the New Jersey Turnpike (which has a steadily
increasing rate of toll per mile once you pass I-195) all the way to the
George Washington Bridge, or you can take it part way towards NYC (specific
directions available on request).
</p><p>
This route is relatively expensive, and the scenery isn't wonderful...
especially the oil refinery and shipping district north of the Raritan River.
</p><p>
However, there is a reasonable alternate route (on a day without ice or snow)
for the part through Maryland and Delaware... take US 50 east to the eastern
shore of Maryland, then take US 301 through Maryland and Delaware to US 13
north to I-295.
</p><p>
In really nice weather (and with extra time), one can also drive over to
Lewes, Delaware, take the ferry to Cape May, NJ and drive up the Jersey shore
on the Garden State Parkway (don't do this until spring).<br/>

I really like that the Delaware River bridge was built before the rest of 
the Interstate, leaving about a 5 mile stretch of opened road that 
doesn't really connect to anything.

<strong><center>UPDATE</center></strong><br/>
There appears to be a new offical plan for I-95.  I-95 will go through 
Philadelphia as it does now.  A direct connection with the PA Turnpike 
(I-276) will be made.  There it will hook up with the NJ Turnpike for the 
rest of the way.  This will of course, make I-295 a three state 3DI which 
I believe is a record.
<p> 
Ok many people wrote in to point out that this would only tie the 
record.  I-275 goes through Kentucky, Ohio, and Indiana.
