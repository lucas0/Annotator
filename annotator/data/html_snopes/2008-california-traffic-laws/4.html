   An act to amend Section 21201 of the Vehicle Code, relating to
vehicles.



	LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGEST


   AB 478, Wolk. Vehicles: bicycle safety.
   (1) The Vehicle Code regulates the safe operation of bicycles on
highways and roadways. Operation of a bicycle upon a highway, during
darkness, requires the use of an illuminated lamp and certain
specified reflecting devices. It is a crime to violate any provision
of the Vehicle Code.
   This bill would expand the places where the operator of a bicycle
is required to use an illuminated lamp and certain specified
reflecting devices to include sidewalks where bicycle operation is
not prohibited by the local jurisdiction and bikeways, as defined.
The bill would expand the requirement that the operator of the
bicycle have reflectors on each pedal to include the option of having
reflectors on his or her shoes or ankles.
   Because this bill would create a new crime, this bill would impose
a state-mandated local program.
   (2) The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse
local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the
state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that
reimbursement.
   This bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this
act for a specified reason.


THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

  SECTION 1.  Section 21201 of the Vehicle Code is amended to read:
   21201.  (a) No person shall operate a bicycle on a roadway unless
it is equipped with a brake which will enable the operator to make
one braked wheel skid on dry, level, clean pavement.
   (b) No person shall operate on the highway a bicycle equipped with
handlebars so raised that the operator must elevate his hands above
the level of his shoulders in order to grasp the normal steering grip
area.
   (c) No person shall operate upon a highway a bicycle that is of a
size that prevents the operator from safely stopping the bicycle,
supporting it in an upright position with at least one foot on the
ground, and restarting it in a safe manner.
   (d) A bicycle operated during darkness upon a highway, a sidewalk
where bicycle operation is not prohibited by the local jurisdiction,
or a bikeway, as defined in Section 890.4 of the Streets and Highways
Code, shall be equipped with all of the following:
   (1) A lamp emitting a white light that, while the bicycle is in
motion, illuminates the highway, sidewalk, or bikeway in front of the
bicyclist and is visible from a distance of 300 feet in front and
from the sides of the bicycle.
   (2) A red reflector on the rear that shall be visible from a
distance of 500 feet to the rear when directly in front of lawful
upper beams of headlamps on a motor vehicle.
   (3) A white or yellow reflector on each pedal, shoe, or ankle
visible from the front and rear of the bicycle from a distance of 200
feet.
   (4) A white or yellow reflector on each side forward of the center
of the bicycle, and a white or red reflector on each side to the
rear of the center of the bicycle, except that bicycles that are
equipped with reflectorized tires on the front and the rear need not
be equipped with these side reflectors.
   The reflectors and reflectorized tires shall be of a type meeting
requirements established by the department.
   (e) A lamp or lamp combination, emitting a white light, attached
to the operator and visible from a distance of 300 feet in front and
from the sides of the bicycle, may be used in lieu of the lamp
required by paragraph (1) of subdivision (d).
  SEC. 2.  No reimbursement is required by this act pursuant to
Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California Constitution because
the only costs that may be incurred by a local agency or school
district will be incurred because this act creates a new crime or
infraction, eliminates a crime or infraction, or changes the penalty
for a crime or infraction, within the meaning of Section 17556 of the
Government Code, or changes the definition of a crime within the
meaning of Section 6 of Article XIII B of the California
Constitution.
