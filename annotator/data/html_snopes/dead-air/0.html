owns a car dealership in southern California.  And he called us to discuss
his problem.  Not a car problem, a schnauzer problem.  Max's story went
on for 15 minutes and turned out to be the canine equivalent of the
"Alice's Restaurant Massacre," minus the four-part harmony.</p>
<p>We've had so many requests for this story that we had our Car Talk Lackeys
transcribe our phone call with Max, and have included the full story here,
in all its canine splendor--although it's not quite the same without Max's
magnificent German accent.</p>
<p>(By the way, if you're a purist and want to hear the actual call, tapes of
the show with Max and the Schnauzer are available in our <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/19981202120429/http://cartalk.cars.com/Tools/store.pl?page=browse">Shameless Commerce
Division</a>. It's Program # 9610.)</p>

<p><b><font color="NAVY">Max and the Schnauzer</font><br/>
Car Talk<br/>
March 9, 1996</b></p>
<p>(To be read in your finest German/Jewish accent...)</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Max:</b> This Maxmillan from Valencia, California. I am listening to your
program and I think that you guys are the Mensch. I have a problem.</p>
<p><b>Ray:</b> "What did you say about our stench? I didn't get all that!"</p>
<p><b>Tom:</b> "And if we can't solve it, our audience can solve it--because what?  They're the ones with the brains and we're the morons."</p>
<p><b>Max:</b>  I have been in the car business all my life. And last Friday the 13th
I had a problem.  My sales guys stand in the driveway waiting for
customers. I see one of my salesmen jump onto his bike and take off like
crazy. An old woman who had just bought a new Camry is driving by, and
"BANG!" He hits her front bumper.</p>
<p><b>Tom:</b> Heh heh heh heh heh heh.</p>
<p><b>Max:</b>  My God! What an unlucky day. I run out to help my salesman and the
woman says, "My God! I just bought this car!" And I say, "Well, ma'am you
could have just killed my salesman." She say, "I know. I know. I wasn't
watching." She was so honest. "The salesman didn't show me how to turn on
the air conditioning. It's 100 degrees and I'm trying to find the
air conditioner, and "BANG!"</p>
<p><b>Tom:</b> Heh heh heh heh heh.</p>
<p><b>Max:</b> Now she <i>thought that she hit him!</i> I know that
<i>he hit her</i>. I relax and say, "Thanks, God!" I say,
"Ma'am, you're so honest, I will take care of you. We have a big body shop
here. We'll put on a new bumper for you. I like your honesty, that you said
you weren't watching." See, I saw how my stupid salesman wasn't watching
when he took off.</p>
<p>I take the car to the body shop and call Rick. I tell Rick, "We'll put on a
new bumper and put four screws in and that'll be that and it'll be the end
of the story."</p>
<p>The woman tells me, "Max, I'm going across the street to go shopping while
you fix the bumper." I say, "Great idea!"</p>
<p>So, she goes across the street. Poor woman didn't know that the body shop
closes at 6:00 pm. Eight-thirty she shows up with 20 bags! She's
looking around--and no car! The body shop is closed and there's nobody
there.</p>
<p><b>Ray:</b> "I got it! I got it! She buys a new car from <i>George!</i>"</p>
<p><b>Max:</b> No, no, listen to this. It's a true story. I have a problem, guys. I
take my keys to the body shop and and run down there and open this huge
metal door and what do I see? They pushed 35 cars behind her car.
I go to the back seat of the car, I see a cage with a little Schnauzer.</p>
<p>And he's dead.</p>
<p><b>Tom:</b> Uh oh. No!</p>
<p><b>Max:</b> He's dead. With his legs up. I started sweating, my heart starts
beating! This stupid body shop guy put the car next to the paint booth with
everything locked. it's one hundred and ten degrees in there, with all
those paint fumes! Great, I think, that's all I need now!</p>
<p><b><font color="NAVY">Part II</font></b></p>
<p>I'm lucky, I've worked twenty five years in Valencia. I know everyone. Right
away I go to the phone and I call a customer of mine who has a pet shop,
and I say, "Joe. I have a big problem. I just killed a schauzer in my body
shop." He said, "Max I like you. If I had a schnauzer I'd give you one.
But, I don't have one. So, he goes to his computer and starts locating
breeders.</p>
<p><b>Ray:</b> "Yeah, a schnauzer search."</p>
<p><b>Max:</b> He says, "Max, you're lucky. Twenty miles from here there's a German
breeder in Acton. The computer shows he's got 12 Schnauzers!"</p>
<p>I take the car 300 miles an hour to this breeder and put the schauzer on
the table and I say....</p>
<p><b>Tom:</b> "Hans--match 'em up!"</p>
<p><b>Max: </b>I say, "Hans, I need a miniature schauzer like this one.</p>
<p><b>Tom:</b> Heh heh heh heh heh heh.</p>
<p><b>Max:</b> He says, "Max, you're in the wrong place. I do have 12, but those
12 I have are champions. Purebreed. I bring them over from Germany. I
have all the certificates. This new miniature schnauzer will cost you
between $1,500 to $2,000 apiece.</p>
<p>I say, "What??!!!" I counted every pocket, I had three hundred and seventy
five dollars. I say, "Hans, I don't need a champion. I just want to replace
this dead one."</p>
<p>He goes to his backyard and comes with this miniature Schnauzer. He says,
"Max, you're lucky. He's a year old. He's house trained. I don't have a
certificate for him. I'll give him to you "as is" for $275."</p>
<p><b>Ray:</b> "What? No warranty?"</p>
<p><b>Tom:</b> Heh heh heh heh heh.</p>
<p><b>Max:</b> No, no warranty. "As is." I say "Great" and give him the money. He
takes the dead one and puts it in box. I take the live one and put it in a
cage, and I drive right down to the dealership.</p>
<p>I get to the dealership and say, "Thanks, God!" The woman is waiting in the
dealership and I say, "Honey, here're your keys, here's your car, let me
help you with all the stuff you bought."</p>
<p>She says, "Max. I don't want help. I've had it today! She takes the stuff,
she goes to the car, she looks in the front window, turns away, looks in
again, she throws down all the stuff she's holding in her arms and comes
back to the showroom screaming, "Max! This is not my dog!"</p>
<p>I say, "What dog?"</p>
<p>She says, "Max, don't play games with me. If you won't get me my dog right
away I'll call the police and you'll have a big problem. Max, when I drove
in here I had a dead dog in my car."</p>
<p><b>Tom:</b> Heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh.</p>
<p><b>Ray:</b> Heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh.</p>
<p><b><font color="NAVY">Part III</font></b></p>
<p><b>Max:</b> I said, "I have your dead dog. I thought they killed him in the body
shop." We drove back to Hans and we saw her dog lying in the box and she
says, "Max, you're lucky he still has my dog." Now, I don't know whether to
laugh or to cry! She takes the dead dog and wants to take off.</p>
<p>But, I have to ask what happened.</p>
<p>She says, "Max, I never had any children. This dog is 17 years and
3 months old. And this morning I went to the bedroom and the dog was
dead. I called my sister, and told her that Snoopy died." Her sister says,
"What do you want? He's almost eighteen years old, he's completely blind.
The time came--thanks, God! You got rid of him."</p>
<p>Her sister tells her to take the dog to Thousand Oaks, where they have a
dog hospital. They'll freeze Snoopy and stuff him, and he looks alive and
you'll have him forever in your bedroom. So, she took the dog and dropped
by to pick up the car, and that's how it happened.</p>
<p><b><font color="NAVY">Part IV</font></b></p>
<p>So, now I'm here with Hans the breeder, with this live dog, trying to give
him back. And Hans has this sign that says, "No Refunds." He says, "Max,
I'm running a business. Dead dog or no dead dog, you own this schnauzer."</p>
<p>I say, "Fine. I'll leave it in consignment. Give me half the money."</p>
<p>Guess what? This Friday I get a note from Hans that he wants $75
a week to feed him! Now I have to pay him!</p>
<p>So here's the help I need. I need a good home for this good little
schauzer. He's a good dog. One year old. But no paperwork.</p>
<p><b>Tom:</b> Okay, this is a business we haven't started yet. We've matched up some
people before, but never something like this.</p>
<p><b>Ray:</b> You could give it to the old woman. This one could play with the other
one. Wouldn't be too exciting, though.</p>
<p><b>Max:</b> It's no joke.</p>
<p><b>Ray:</b> I know it's no joke. You know why? Because you couldn't have possibly made up a story like this.</p>
<p><b>Max:</b> I really want this dog to have a good home. You know, the whole story
is sad in a way.</p>
<p><b>Ray:</b> You're a good guy, Max, and you tell a good story.</p>
<p><b>Tom:</b> We'll work on a name. His name should be Max. Okay, so we're looking
for a home for little Max.</p>
<p><b>Max:</b> Okay, thanks for talking with you.</p>
<p><b>Tom:</b> Bye bye, Max!</p>
