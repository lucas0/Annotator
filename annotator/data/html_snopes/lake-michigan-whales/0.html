it's wonderful sailing and cool fresh water, but little has been known about the abundant 
whale and dolphin population until recently.  As winter turns to spring and the cool waters of the 
lake are warmed by the sun, the fresh water sperm whales and dolphins begin their annual southbound 
1300-mile journey from Hudson Bay.  Although there are a number of locks at Sault St. Marie, 
these beautiful and intelligent creatures forge a faster route through nearby streams, and 
by mid-June, they have reached the breeding grounds of southern Lake Michigan that they know as their "summer home".  Freed from the threat of the whalers, taking benefits of the clean waters and abundant food of coho salmon, lake trout and zebra mussels, the whales remain in 
the southernmost 60 miles of the lake through mid-September.

A historical note ... the Lake Michigan Sperm Whale has been protected since the early 
1920's, due to a little known provision of the Volstead Act.  This spelled an end to the carnage 
caused by the whalers along the southern shores of Lake Michigan, and ensured the protection of this fresh water mammal.  You can see remnants of whaling villages all over the shores of Michigan, Indiana and Illinois ... many of the traditional whaling harbors are now the present day marinas of Michigan, Indiana and Illinois.

Thank you to all those who have inquired to us here at Lake Michigan Whale
Watching - we are overwealmed with requests for information, and your feedback has been very valuable.  We are currently trying to solve a couple of problems before we can get back underway with our Lake Michigan whale-watching trips and "swim with the dolphins" program (by renowned marine-biologist George Bell).</font></p><p><font face="arial" size="2">

1.  Hector the whale-spotter has gone back to
Guatemala for a month-long vacation/siesta.  This could not
have come at a worse time for those of us here at LMWW.  Without Hector, we have no
way of spotting the whales from high atop the sand
dunes.  We are currently training his understudy,
Ricardo, however, it is a very steep learning curve. 
He's almost ready, though the loss of Hector is a huge blow to our operation.</font></p><p><font face="arial" size="2">

2.  Tranquil, one of our sturdy vessels, had a
ruptured seacock and flooded.  Unfortunately, the
bilge pump is from a salt-water vessel and can only
pump salt-water, not fresh-water.  We did not know
this when we purchased Tranquil.  This has now been
repaired and she is almost ready for service.</font></p><p><font face="arial" size="2">

3.  The FCC has severely curtailed our flights on the Admiral and Island Cynthia from
Chicago to the Ernie Broglio Marina and Seaplane
Lagoon.  We are negotiating for resumption of our
landing rights as we speak.</font></p><p><font face="arial" size="2">

4.  We understand that the whales and dolphins have begun their fall journey back to their winter home in Hudson Bay.  This is not really a problem; it happens each year as the waters of Lake Michigan get a little cool for them.  However, we expect 2005 will be just as good as 2004 for whale watching in the beautiful waters of southern Lake Michigan.</font></p><p><font face="arial" size="2">

When Hector returns from Guatamala and Tranquil is
again ready, I am sure that our service will resume as
previously offered.  I think the whales miss us, I know the dolphins do!  Thank you for your patience.</font></p><p><font face="arial" size="2">

First of all, I would like to thank you for finally acknowledging the

whale.  Not only are the whales that travel the Southwest Michigan 
coast gentle creatures, but also spectacular to view and are one of the most

We received the letter below in mid-November 2002.  We asked our renowned marine biologist George Bell about this and he informed us that it is likely accurate, as the whales begin their journey back toward Hudson Bay in late summer ... the timeframe of "just after Labor Day" is about right.

when I was salmon fishing. We fished a couple of times in Lake Michigan and 
saw the Sperm whale once. Then I started fishing right after Labor Day just
inside Lake Huron by Mackinac Island. I actually developed a friendship
with one of the whales up there which we named 'Old Blue'. He was a Pacific
Gray (didn't know we had them in the Great Lakes) and had taken one of my
lures. I got him up to the boat and showed him the pliers for removing the
hook and he just held his mouth right there for me. I felt like a dentist.
Anyway, after that he'd herd the salmon toward us and we'd fill our limit
every time. He helped one other way also. I'd caught a too-small steelhead
and the game warden came up as I was reeling it in. I just unhooked the
fish and tossed him to Old Blue who promptly disposed of the evidence!</i></font></font></p><p><font face="arial" size="2"><font face="arial" size="2"><i>

From what I hear, he's still up there with his own pod of 7 Pacific grays
and ranges all the way down to the mouth of the St Clair river, but he stays
away from salmon fishermen now.</i></font></font></p><p><font face="arial" size="2"><font face="arial" size="2"><i>

I know it was exciting for me when I saw them.</i></font></font></p><p><font face="arial" size="2"><font face="arial" size="2"><i>

Hello, regarding an item on your Lake Michigan whale watching site.  The emailed comment from Doug about seeing a pod of Pacific Gray Whales in Lake Michigan is undoubtedly a confusion by Doug with perhaps the last remnants of the Atlantic Gray Whale population. This is a significant finding. You should give it greater prominence on your site. In particular you should task your marine biologist colleague, George Bell, to research this further. I think George, though he undoubtedly meant well, was too quick to offer a decision based on temperature. George may not be familiar with the scientific literature on the historical population of gray whales in the North Atlantic. There are historic mentions and skeletal remains of gray whales in the North Atlantic including America. The gray whale was common in American waters at one time, and was known as the scrag whale to whalers. Radiocarbon dating shows the most recent specimen to date from colonial times, around 1675 AD. If sperm whales can transit from the North Atlantic to Lake Michigan, then so can gray whales. See: JG Mead and ED Mitchell. Atlantic Gray Whales. IN: The Gray Whale, Eschrichtius robustus. Edited by ML Jones, SL Swartz, and S Leatherwood. Orlando : Academic Press, 1984. pp. 33-53 If you would like me to send you or George a photocopy of this chapter, let me know. Doug's finding of a gray whale pod in Lake Michigan is very significant, and George can publish his fieldwork on this remnant population of Atlantic gray whales in a scientific journal. Thank you for your very informative site on whale watching in Lake Michigan. My Navajo forebears would surely appreciate your commitment to increasing public appreciation for Lake Michigan and its natural environment.</i></font></font></p><p><font face="arial" size="2"><font face="arial" size="2"><i>
