<td><p align="left"><b><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Hi,<br/>My name is Lauren Archer, my son Kevin and I lived in Midrand. <br/>On October 2nd, 1999, I took my only son to McDonald's for his 3rd birthday.<br/>After he finished lunch, I allowed him to play in the ball pit. When he started whining later on, I asked him what was wrong, he pointed to the back of his pull-up and simply said "Mommy, it hurts." But I couldn't find anything wrong with him at that time. <br/>I bathed him when we got home, and it was at that point when I found a welt on his left buttock.  Upon investigating, it! ! seemed as if there was something like a splinter under the welt.  I made an appointment to have it taken out the next day, but soon he started vomiting and shaking, then his eyes rolled back into his head.  <br/>From there, we went to the emergency room. He died later that night.  It  turned out that the welt on his buttock was the tip of a hypodermic needle that had broken off inside.  <br/>The autopsy revealed that Kevin had died from heroine overdose. <br/>The next week, the police removed the balls from the ball pit and lo and behold. There was rotten food, several hypodermic needles: some full; some used; knives, half-eaten candy, diapers, feces, and the stench of urine. If a child is not safe in a child's play area then where? <br/>You can find the article on Kevin Archer in the October 10,1999, issue of the Midrand Chronicle. <br/>Please forward this to all loving mothers.</font></b></p></td>

<td bgcolor="Silver"><pre>Hello,

I have gotten a couple of e-mails (same one) from different people about 
the McDonalds in your town. I'm a fire prevention officer in Oregon and the 
story just did not look wright, so I e-mailed McDonalds, and this is what 
they said:

&gt;From: "McDonald's Corporation" <mcdonaldland>
&gt;To: "'original data removed
&gt;Subject: RE: McDonald's Reply
&gt;Date: Tue, 1 Feb 2000 10:11:05 -0600
&gt;
&gt;Hello name removed:
&gt;
&gt;Thank you for taking the time to contact McDonald's Corporation directly 
&gt;to receive accurate
&gt;information regarding a rumor you have heard.  We have thoroughly 
&gt;investigated this rumor
&gt;and it is absolutely not true.  There have been no such incidents ever 
&gt;reported at any
&gt;McDonald's.  In addition, there has never been an article in any newspaper 
&gt;regarding this
&gt;rumor.
&gt;
&gt;Unfortunately these types of rumors bring unnecessary concerns for our 
&gt;customers.  It is
&gt;important to know that safety is a top priority at McDonald's, especially 
&gt;as it relates to children.
&gt;We take many precautions to ensure our Playlands are safe.
&gt;
&gt;We do realize that the Internet is a "hotbed" for irresponsible rumors, 
&gt;and for that reason, we
&gt;especially appreciate the fact that you have taken the time to contact 
&gt;McDonald's for the
&gt;facts.  I encourage you to share this e-mail with anyone who shares this 
&gt;rumor with you.
&gt;
&gt;If you have any questions, please feel free to call me at 
&gt;630-623-6198.  Again, thank you for
&gt;contacting McDonald's.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Sandi
&gt;Customer Satisfaction Department


After a couple of days I received your web site info from one of the people 
I had send this reply from McDonalds to.

It was interesting that I could not find that newspaper either, and then to 
see it on your web site to confirm my suspicions.

Just wanted to let you know.
