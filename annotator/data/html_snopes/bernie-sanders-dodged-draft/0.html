                                to actions conflicting with their society's
                                legal system or government. The legal definition
                                and status of conscientious objection has varied
                                over the years and from nation to nation.
                                Religious beliefs were a starting point in many
                                nations for legally granting conscientious
                                objection status. Acceptable grounds for
                                granting conscientious objector status have
                                broadened in many countries.<o:p>

                                wars distinguish between wars of offensive
                                aggression and defensive wars while others

                                consistent but may depend on circumstance or
                                political conviction. Currently, the U.S.
                                Selective Service System states, "Beliefs
                                which qualify a registrant for conscientious
                                objector status may be religious in nature, but
                                don't have to be. Beliefs may be moral or
                                ethical; however, a man's reasons for not
                                wanting to participate in a war must not be
                                based on politics, expediency, or self-interest.

                                his claim must reflect his current claims.” In
                                the US, this applies to primary claims, that is,
                                those filed on initial SSS registration. On the

                                reasons for refusing to serve are varied. Many
                                conscientious objectors are so for religious
                                reasons. Members of the Historic Peace Churches
                                are pacifist by doctrine. Jehovah's Witnesses,
                                who, while not pacifist in the strict sense,
                                refuse to participate in the armed services on
                                the grounds that they believe Christians should
                                be neutral in worldly conflicts. Some look at
                                Romans 12:19, which says, Do not take revenge,
                                my friends, but leave room for God's wrath, for
                                it is written: "It is mine to avenge; I
                                will repay," says the Lord. Other
                                objections can stem from a deep sense of
                                responsibility toward humanity as a whole, or
                                from simple denial that any government should

                                are divergent views about the degree of pacifism
                                in the early Christian Church. Within the <st1:place w:st="on">

                                avoiding military service was not a problem,
                                because the legions and other armed forces were
                                largely composed of volunteers. Some legionaries
                                who converted to Christianity were able to
                                reconcile warfare with their Christian beliefs
                                which is formalized in the Just War theory. This
                                option became more normal after <st1:city w:st="on">

                                Empire. In the 11th century, there was a further
                                shift of opinion in the Latin-Christian
                                tradition with the crusades, strengthening the
                                idea and acceptability of Holy War. Objectors
                                became a minority.<o:p>

                                imposed various forms of military obligation,
                                before and after the crusading movement (which
                                was composed of volunteers). But the demand was
                                to send someone rather than any particular
                                person. Those who did not wish to fight, for
                                whatever reason, were left alone if they could
                                pay or persuade someone else to go. Armies in
                                medieval times were quite small - for instance
                                Bosworth Field settled the fate of England
                                with 8,000 fighting for Richard III defeated by
                                5,000 gathered by Henry Tudor/Henry VII. The
                                question of unwilling service did not arise
                                until armies became much larger.<o:p>

                                argument used by some Christian objectors is
                                that every soldier should be given the choice to
                                go home before every battle according to
                                Deuteronomy 20:8 which states, Then the officers
                                shall add, "Is any man afraid or
                                fainthearted? Let him go home so that his
                                brothers will not become disheartened too."
                                By this interpretation, any military draft as
                                well as all military service that is based on
                                enlistment in years or tours of duty would be

                                accept noncombatant roles. Alternatives to

                                imprisonment or other punishment for refusing
                                conscription, falsely claiming unfitness for

                                country which does not extradite those wanted
                                for military conscription. Avoiding military

                                individuals could provide a substitute or pay
                                $300 to hire one. By 1864 the draft act allowed
                                the $300 to be paid for the benefit of sick and
                                wounded soldiers. Conscientious objectors in
                                Confederate States initially had few options.
                                Responses included moving to northern states,
                                hiding in the mountains, joining the army but
                                refusing to use a weapon or imprisonment.
                                Between late 1862 and 1864 a payment of $500
                                into the public treasury exempted conscientious

                                War II. From 1941 to 1947 nearly 12,000
                                draftees, unwilling to do any type of military

                                from the general population both because of the
                                government's concern that a pacifist philosophy
                                would spread and that conscientious objectors
                                would not be tolerated in neighboring
                                communities. A constant problem through the
                                duration of the program, especially in camps
                                located in national forests for fire control,

                                needs of the men was the responsibility of their

                                skeptical of the program, government agencies
                                learned to appreciate the men's service and
                                requested more workers from the program. CPS

                                service. Some worked as stretcher-bearers, which
                                was dangerous even though no one intentionally
                                shot at them.<o:p>

                                much less harsh - it was generally enough to say

                                every adult man can be obligated to military
                                service called Wehrdienst. The draftee can apply
                                for an alternative service called "Zivildienst"
                                (civilian service), if he declares conscience

                                applied since October 1, 2004. Before that date
                                the civilian service was longer than military
                                service, because soldiers could later be called

                                Pacifist persuasion, due to pervasive public
                                feeling that the country was fighting for its

                                army took up the job of keeping a sizeable

                                2005, the Swiss parliament considered whether
                                willingness to serve 1.5 times longer than an
                                army recruit was sufficient proof of sincerity,
                                citing that the cost of judging the state of
                                conscience of just a few thousand men per year
                                was too great.<o:p>

                                In Germany, objections to military service are
                                filed in writing, and an oral hearing is only
                                scheduled if the written testimonials has been
                                unconvincing; in practice, due to the heavy

                                written applications only summarily, and it
                                denies the alternative of a civilian service
                                only in cases of grave shortcomings or

                                and you, shipwrecked, need cling to it in order
                                to save your life. Another person swims nearby
                                and he also is in need of this plank. If you
                                deny him the plank, you are apparently ready to
                                accept the killing of a human being, and
                                therefore able to serve in the military.
                                Otherwise, when you would give the plank to your

                                and therefore not credible. "Well, it comes

                                because it is elusive, and in stating that there
                                would be a fight you imply that somebody might

                                self-defense, perhaps when a friend or family
                                member is in immediate danger. The analogy to a
                                possible commitment in the military is wrong
                                since defending an emotionally close person
