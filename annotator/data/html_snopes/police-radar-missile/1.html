<p><b>CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION TO RADAR</b></p>
<p><b>INTRODUCTION. The word "RADAR" is an acronym for Radio
Detection and Ranging. As it was originally conceived, radio waves were
used to detect the presence of a target and to determine its distance or
range. </b></p>
<p><b>CHAPTER 2. CHARACTERISTICS OF RF RADIATION</b></p>
<p><b>INTRODUCTION. In order for a radar system to determine range, azimuth,
elevation, or velocity data, it must transmit and receive electromagnetic
radiation. This electromagnetic radiation is referred to as radio frequency
(RF) radiation. RF transmissions have specific characteristics that determine
the capabilities and limitations of a radar system to provide these target
discriminants, based on an analysis of the characteristics of the target
return. The frequency of transmitted RF energy affects the ability of a
radar system to analyze target return, based on time, to determine target
range. RF frequency also affects the ability of the transmitting antenna
to focus RF energy into a narrow beam to provide azimuth and elevation
information. The wavelength and frequency of the transmitted RF energy
impact the propagation of the radar signal through the atmosphere. The
polarization of the RF signal affects the amount of clutter the radar must
contend with. The ability of a radar system to use the Doppler effect in
analyzing the radar return impacts the velocity discrimination capability
of the radar. These characteristics of RF radiation will be discussed in
this chapter.</b></p>
<p><b>CHAPTER 3. RADAR SIGNAL CHARACTERISTICS</b></p>
<p><b>INTRODUCTION. Every radar produces a radio frequency (RF) signal
with specific characteristics that differentiate it from all other signals
and define its capabilities and limitations. Pulse width (pulse duration),
pulse recurrence time (pulse recurrence interval), pulse recurrence frequency,
and power are all radar signal characteristics determined by the radar
transmitter. Listening time, rest time, and recovery time are radar receiver
characteristics. An understanding of the terms used to describe these characteristics
is critical to understanding radar operation.</b></p>
<p><b>CHAPTER 4. RADAR SYSTEM COMPONENTS</b></p>
<p><b>INTRODUCTION. The individual components of a radar determine the
capabilities and limitations of a particular radar system. The characteristics
of these components also determine the countermeasures that will be effective
against a specific radar system. This chapter will discuss the components
of a basic pulse radar, a continuous wave (CW) radar, a pulse Doppler radar,
and a monopulse radar.</b></p>
<p><b>CHAPTER 5. RADAR PRINCIPLES </b></p>
<p><b>INTRODUCTION. The primary purpose of radar systems is to determine
the range, azimuth, elevation, or velocity of a target. The ability of
a radar system to determine and resolve these important target parameters
depends on the characteristics of the transmitted radar signal. This chapter
explains the relationship of radar frequency (RF), pulse recurrence frequency
(PRF), pulse width (PW), and beamwidth to target detection and resolution.</b></p>
<p><b>CHAPTER 6. RADAR SCANS</b></p>
<p><b>INTRODUCTION. The method radar antennas employ to sample the environment
is a critical design feature of the radar system. This method is often
called the radar scan. The scan type selected for a particular radar system
often decides the employment of that radar in an integrated air defense
system (IADS). The process the radar antenna uses to search airspace for
targets is called scanning or sweeping. This chapter will discuss circular,
unidirectional, bidirectional, Helical, Raster, Palmer, and conical scans,
and track-while-scan (TWS) radar systems.</b></p>
<p><b>CHAPTER 7. TARGET TRACKING</b></p>
<p><b>INTRODUCTION. A target tracking radar (TTR) is designed to provide
all the necessary information to guide a missile or aim a gun to destroy
an aircraft. Once a target has been detected, either by a dedicated search
radar or by using an acquisition mode, the TTR is designed to provide accurate
target range, azimuth, elevation, or velocity information to a fire control
computer.</b></p>
<p><b>CHAPTER 8. MISSILE GUIDANCE TECHNIQUES INTRODUCTION. Once a target
has been designated, acquired, and tracked by a radar system, the final
stage in target engagement is to guide a missile or projectile to destroy
the target. There are three basic requirements for successful missile guidance:
(1) precise target tracking by a target tracking radar (TTR) or from an
infrared (IR) tracker to provide target parameters (range, azimuth, elevation,
velocity, etc.); (2) a method to track the position of the missile compared
with the target; and (3) a fire control computer to generate missile guidance
commands based on target and missile position. The missile guidance techniques
employed by modern air-to-air and surface-to-air missile (SAM) systems
will be covered in this chapter. In addition, the target engagement techniques
employed by antiaircraft artillery (AAA) systems will also be discussed.
There are three distinct phases in any missile intercept: boost, mid-course,
and terminal.</b></p>
<p><b>CHAPTER 9. INTRODUCTION TO RADAR JAMMING</b></p>
<p><b>INTRODUCTION. Radar jamming is the intentional radiation or reradiation
of radio frequency (RF) signals to interfere with the operation of a radar
by saturating its receiver with false targets or false target information.
Radar jamming is one principal component of electronic combat (EC). Specifically,
it is the electronic attack (EA) component of electronic warfare (EW).
Radar jamming is designed to counter the radar systems that play a vital
role in support of an enemy integrated air defense system (IADS). The primary
purpose of radar jamming is to create confusion and deny critical information
to negate the effectiveness of enemy radar systems. This chapter will introduce
the two types of radar jamming, the three radar jamming employment options,
and discuss the fundamental principles that determine the effectiveness
of radar jamming.</b></p>
<p><b>CHAPTER 10. RADAR NOISE JAMMING</b></p>
<p><b>INTRODUCTION. A radar noise jamming system is designed to generate
a disturbance in a radar receiver to delay or deny target detection. Since
thermal noise is always present in the radar receiver, noise jamming attempts
to mask the presence of targets by substantially adding to this noise level.
Radar noise jamming can be employed by stand-off jamming (SOJ) assets,
escort jamming assets, or as a self-protection jamming technique. Radar
noise jamming usually employs high power jamming signals tuned to the frequency
of the victim radar. This chapter will discuss the factors that determine
the effectiveness of radar noise jamming, radar noise jamming generation,
and the most common noise jamming techniques. These noise jamming techniques
include barrage, spot, swept spot, cover pulse, and modulated noise jamming.</b></p>
<p><b>CHAPTER 11. DECEPTION JAMMING</b></p>
<p><b>INTRODUCTION. Deception jamming systems are designed to inject false
information into a victim radar to deny critical information on target
azimuth, range, velocity, or a combination of these parameters. To be effective,
a deception jammer receives the victim radar signal, modifies this signal,
and retransmits this altered signal back to the victim radar. Because these
systems retransmit, or repeat, a replica of the victim's radar signal,
deception jammers are known as repeater jammers. The retransmitted signal
must match all victim radar signal characteristics including frequency,
pulse recurrence frequency (PRF), pulse recurrence interval (PRI), pulse
width, and scan rate. However, the deception jammer does not have to replicate
the power of the victim radar system.</b></p>
<p><b>CHAPTER 12. CHAFF EMPLOYMENT</b></p>
<p><b>INTRODUCTION. Chaff was first used during World War II when the Royal
Air Force, under the code name "Window," dropped bales of metallic
foil during a night bombing raid in July 1943. The bales of foil were thrown
from each bomber as it approached the target. The disruption of German
AAA fire control and ground control intercept (GCI) radars rendered these
systems almost totally ineffective. Based on this early success, chaff
employment became a standard bomber tactic for the rest of the war.</b></p>
<p><b>CHAPTER 13. FLARE EMPLOYMENT </b></p>
<p><b>INTRODUCTION. Since their introduction in the 1950s, infrared (IR)
missiles have been an increasing threat from both ground-based and airborne
systems. The range, reliability, and effectiveness of IR missiles have
been continuously updated and improved by advanced detector materials and
computer technology. Since IR missiles are passive, they are relatively
simple and inexpensive to produce. These characteristics have contributed
to the proliferation of IR missiles in the combat arena. Nearly every aircraft
flying in either the air-to-air or air-to-surface role, now carries an
all-aspect IR missile. Additionally, every infantry unit down to the platoon
level is equipped with shoulder-fired IR missiles. The primary countermeasure
against IR missiles is the expendable IR countermeasure, or flare. This
chapter will cover basic IR theory, flare characteristics, flare employment,
and other IR countermeasures (IRCM).</b></p>
<p><b>CHAPTER 14. IR MISSILE FLARE REJECTION</b></p>
<p><b>INTRODUCTION. There are two important characteristics of infrared
(IR) missiles that influence the effectiveness of self-protection flares.
The first is the ability of the IR missile seeker to discriminate between
the IR signature of the aircraft and the IR signature of background interference,
especially clouds. The second is the flare rejection capability built into
the missile seeker and the missile guidance section.</b></p>
<p><b>CHAPTER 15. RADAR ELECTRONIC PROTECTION (EP) TECHNIQUES</b></p>
<p><b>INTRODUCTION. Electronic warfare (EW) is defined as military action
involving the use of electromagnetic and directed energy to control the
electromagnetic spectrum or to attack the enemy. Nearly every military
action, from command and control of an entire integrated air defense system
(IADS) to precision guidance of an individual weapon, depends on effective
use of the electromagnetic spectrum. Radar systems have become a vital
element of nearly every military operation. Since these systems operate
across the entire electromagnetic spectrum, much of the EW effort is concerned
with countering radar systems. All of the jamming techniques discussed
in Chapters 10 and 11 and the chaff employment options discussed in Chapter
12 are specifically designed to counter radar systems. These actions are
classified as electronic attack (EA), which is a division under EW.</b></p>
<p><b>CHAPTER 16. RADAR WARNING RECEIVER (RWR) BASIC OPERATIONS</b></p>
<p><b>INTRODUCTION. Radar surveillance and radar directed weapons represent
the biggest threat to aircraft survival on the modern battlefield. The
first step in countering these threat systems is to provide the pilot or
crew with timely information on the signal environment. The radar warning
receiver (RWR) is designed to provide this vital information to the pilot.
The RWR system is an example of an electronic warfare support (ES) system.
ES is a division under electronic warfare (EW). The primary purpose of
an RWR system is to provide a depiction of the electronic order of battle
(EOB) that can have an immediate impact on aircraft survival. Though the
RWR system is complex, the basic operations of the various components is
straightforward. This chapter will discuss the functions of the various
components of a RWR system including the antennas, receiver/amplifiers,
signal processor, emitter identification (EID) tables, RWR scope, RWR audio,
and limitations to RWR systems.</b></p>
<p><b>CHAPTER 17. SELF-PROTECTION JAMMING SYSTEM OPERATIONS</b></p>
<p><b>INTRODUCTION. Self-protection jamming systems are designed to counter
surface-to-air (SAM), airborne interceptor (AI), and anti-aircraft artillery
(AAA) acquisition and target tracking radars. Self-protection jamming systems
generate noise and deception jamming techniques to either deny threat system
automatic tracking capability or generate sufficient tracking errors to
prevent a successful engagement.</b></p>
