Plantation has been the continuous residence of the Tyler family since

in America, it is over 300 feet long. Sherwood Forest Plantation

<p>John Tyler was the first vice president to ascend to the
presidency upon the death of 9th President, William Henry Harrison.</p>
<p>The plantation, first recorded in a 1616 land grant, was
originally known
as Smith's Hundred. The house, circa 1720, is a classic example of
Virginia
Tidewater design: big house, little house, colonnade, and kitchen. It
had several owners before Tyler purchased
the home and its surrounding 1,600 acres in 1842. He bought the
plantation
from his cousin, Collier Minge, while he was still in the White House
and renamed the plantation "Sherwood Forest" referring to his
reputation
as a political outlaw.</p>
<p>The Tyler family still maintain the plantation today through
the Sherwood Forest Plantation Foundation. Their children and
grandchildren frequently are seen at the Plantation.</p>
<p>Sherwood Forest Plantation remains the longest frame house in
America -- expanded
to its present length of over 300 feet in 1845 when Tyler added a
68-foot
ballroom catering to the popular dance of his time, the Virginia Reel.
The grounds are 25 acres of terraced gardens and lawn based on the
landscape designs of Andrew Jackson Downing of New York and include
original
outbuildings or dependencies. It is considered one of the most complete
plantation yards left in America, dating from c. 1680.</p>
