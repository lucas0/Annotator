cost of any services shall be the cost actually incurred, excluding
therefrom any part of incurred cost found to be unnecessary in the
efficient delivery of needed health services, and shall be determined
in accordance with regulations establishing the method or methods
to be used, and the items to be included, in determining such costs
for various types or classes of institutions, agencies, and services;
except that in any case to which paragraph (2) or (3) applies, the
amount of the payment determined under such paragraph with respect
to the services involved shall be considered the reasonable cost of
such services. In prescribing the regulations referred to in the preceding
sentence, the Secretary shall consider, among other things, the principles
generally applied by national organizations or established prepayment
organizations (which have developed such principles) in computing
the amount of payment, to be made by persons other than the recipients
of services, to providers of services on account of services furnished
to such recipients by such providers. Such regulations may provide
for determination of the costs of services on a per diem, per unit,
per capita, or other basis, may provide for using different methods
in different circumstances, may provide for the use of estimates of
costs of particular items or services, may provide for the establishment
of limits on the direct or indirect overall incurred costs or incurred
costs of specific items or services or groups of items or services
to be recognized as reasonable based on estimates of the costs necessary
in the efficient delivery of needed health services to individuals
covered by the insurance programs established under this title, and
may provide for the use of charges or a percentage of charges where
this method reasonably reflects the costs. Such regulations shall
(i) take into account both direct and indirect costs of providers
of services (excluding therefrom any such costs, including standby
costs, which are determined in accordance with regulations to be unnecessary
in the efficient delivery of services covered by the insurance programs
established under this title) in order that, under the methods of
determining costs, the necessary costs of efficiently delivering covered
services to individuals covered by the insurance programs established
by this title will not be borne by individuals not so covered, and
the costs with respect to individuals not so covered will not be borne
by such insurance programs, and (ii) provide for the making of suitable
retroactive corrective adjustments where, for a provider of services
for any fiscal period, the aggregate reimbursement produced by the
methods of determining costs proves to be either inadequate or excessive.</p>

such rates are reasonably related to (but not necessarily limited
