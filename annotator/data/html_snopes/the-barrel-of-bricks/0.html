The Bricklayer's Song

<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20070428031524/http://paul.merton.ox.ac.uk/work/bricklayer.html">The Bricklayer's Lament</a> was told by Gerard
Hoffnung at the Oxford Union, December 4th, 1958. More recently it was
converted into a song, which <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20070428031524/http://www.corries.com/">The Corries</a>
sang. The song is attributed to

Dear sir I write this note to you to tell you of my plight,<br/>
For at the time of writing it, I'm not a pretty sight,<br/>
My body is all black &amp; blue, my face a deathly grey,<br/>
And I write this note to say why I am not at work today.<br/>
</p><p>
While working on the 14th floor some bricks I had to clear,<br/>
But tossing them down from such a height, was not a good idea,<br/>
The foreman wasn't very pleased, he is an awkward sod,<br/>
and he said I had to cart them down the ladders in me hod.<br/>
</p><p>
Well clearing all these bricks by hand, it was so very slow,<br/>
So I hoisted up a barrel and secured a rope below.<br/>
But in me haste to do the job, I was too blind to see,<br/>
That a barrel full of building bricks was heavier than me.<br/>
</p><p>
And so when I untied the rope, the barrel fell like lead,<br/>
And clinging tightly to the rope, I started up instead.<br/>
I shot up like a rocket, and to my dismay I found<br/>
That halfway up I met the bloody barrel coming down.<br/>
</p><p>
Well, the barrel broke me shoulder as to the ground it sped,<br/>
And when I reached the top, I banged the pulley with me head.<br/>
But I clung on tightly, numb with shock, from this almighty blow,<br/>
While the barrel spilled out half its bricks some fourteen floors below.<br/>
</p><p>
Now when these bricks had fallen from the barrel to the floor,<br/>
I then outweighed the barrel &amp; so started down once more.<br/>
But I clung on tightly to the rope, me body wracked with pain,<br/>
And halfway down I met the bloody barrel once again.<br/>
</p><p>
The force of this collision halfway down the office block,<br/>
Caused multiple abrasions and a nasty case of shock,<br/>
But I clung on tightly to the rope as I fell towards the ground,<br/>
And I landed on the broken bricks the barrel had scattered round.<br/>
</p><p>
Well as I lay there on the floor I thought I'd passed the worst,<br/>
But the barrel hit the pulley wheel &amp; then the bottom burst.<br/>
A shower of bricks rained down on me; I didn't have a hope.<br/>
As I lay there bleeding on the ground I let go the bloody rope.<br/>
</p><p>
The barrel now being heavier, it started down once more.<br/>
It landed right across me as I lay there on the floor.<br/>
It broke three ribs and my left arm, and I can only say,<br/>
"I hope you'll understand why I am not at work today."<br/>
