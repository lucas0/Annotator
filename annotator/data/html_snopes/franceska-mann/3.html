<td valign="top">Although a teacher and poet by profession, University of 
      Utah Professor Jacqueline Osherow appears to be a storyteller at heart. 
      She's not into answering questions about her life or work with "yes," 
      "no," or intellectual musings. Instead, every question serves 
      as a prologue to another story. 
      <p>Naturally, the first question is why Osherow, raised in a tight-knit 
        Jewish community in Philadelphia, would contemplate moving to Utah.<br/>
<br/>
        This story begins in 1989, when Osherow finished her doctoral degree at 
        Princeton: She was looking toward accepting a "dream job" 
        at a private East Coast liberal arts college when she was asked to trek 
        west for a job interview at the U. Osherow, who readily admits to being 
        "a real East Coast kid," knew nothing—beyond some awareness 
        of the LDS Church—about Utah. </p>
<p><img align="right" height="336" src="http://continuum.utah.edu/back_issues/winter04/images/osherow.jpg" width="180"/>Everything 
        changed when Osherow arrived on the U of U campus. She was highly impressed 
        with the quality of students—and the warm reception she received 
        on her interview. </p>
<p>"They were clearly interested in me," Osherow recalls, "and 
        treated me so well." She vividly remembers meeting faculty such 
        as onetime U professor Mark Strand, 1999 recipient of the Pulitzer Prize 
        for Poetry, and current Graduate Studies director Barry Weller. </p>
<p>That East Coast school offered Osherow the position. But somehow, the 
        University of Utah post had metamorphosed into her dream job.<br/>
<br/>
        On that initial visit, Osherow was asked to do something for the first 
        time—a poetry reading. Then, earlier this year, she gave a reading 
        for the College of Humanities at its monthly "Happy Hour," sharing 
        poems that could only have been written because of living in Salt Lake 
        City. </p>
<p>The event was entitled "An East Coast Jewish Poet in the West." 
        While there is no argument on religion, literary occupation 
        or current locale, labeling Osherow an East Coast poet could be called 
        into question. Utah truly has become her home.<br/>
<br/>
        She is active in the local Jewish community and with the University. As 
        well, she's raising three daughters in Utah: Magda (17), Dora (14) 
        and Mollie (10). </p>
<p>"I used to be very much an urban poet," Osherow says. "Utah 
        has really gotten to me." </p>
<p> At the Humanities reading, she shared one of the acclaimed "Scattered 
        Psalms" from her fourth book, <em>Dead Men's Praise</em>. The 
        poem ruminates on a passage from Hebrew Psalm 121:1-2, "I will lift 
        my eyes to the mountains, where help will come." Her Psalm IX in 
        part reads: "there is a chance/That all I'll know of real deliverance/Is 
        these blue-white mountains out my window/Still reeling from this morning's 
        blast of snow." </p>
<p align="center"><img height="273" src="http://continuum.utah.edu/back_issues/winter04/images/mountains.jpg" width="576"/></p>
<p align="left">As she explained to the crowd, "It was really only 
        when I lived here that I finally understood that help really does come 
        from looking at mountains." </p>
<p>Inspiration from Utah might surprise some in the Jewish literary 
        community. But, as Weller points out, "Unlikely destinations are 
        part of the fate of Jewish culture." Weller also notes that Osherow 
        has made her Hebrew Bible class one of the U's "signature 
        courses." </p>
<p>"I've always thought that Jackie is among the most gifted 
        American poets of her generation," says Strand. "She is deeply 
        serious in her commitment to her students." </p>
<p>When discussing her students and how she teaches, she again starts with 
        a story—this from the beginning of the semester, reading her Bible 
        as Literature class roll. "I was absolutely horrified. It said 'lecture.' 
        I don't lecture. They have to read, they have to discuss." 
        Osherow mentions poet Paul Celan's quote, "Poems are gifts 
        to the attentive," which she feels is the greatest definition of 
        poetry. To Osherow, students making their own discoveries provide the 
        best learning experience. </p>
<p>Osherow's principle holds steadfast in her Poetry Workshop. 
        Students are immersed in poetry spanning time and place: "The Mower 
        to the Glow-Worms" from 17th-century British poet Andrew Marvell; 
        an English translation of Rainer Maria Rilke's early 20th-century 
        German poem "Gazelle"; and "Robin Redbreast" from 
        contemporary American author Stanley Kunitz. From Osherow's multitude 
        of gifts to the attentive, students select the poems to explore. 
        Only after analysis, discussion and reflection can the actual writing 
        of poetry begin. </p>
<p>"She is a fabulous teacher," says former student Craig Arnold 
        PhD'01, an assistant professor in creative writing at the University 
        of Wyoming. "She is passionate about poetry and is clear in communicating 
        that passion to students." </p>
<p><img align="right" height="287" src="http://continuum.utah.edu/back_issues/winter04/images/dead_mens_praise.jpg" width="216"/>Osherow 
        also discourages students having one overarching project. "I'm afraid 
        it will cut off possibility," she says. "Go where you're taken. 
        See where that is." </p>
<p>Osherow is utterly surprised to have four books of her own (and another 
        on the way), since she always writes one poem at a time: "I didn't 
        imagine them all fitting together, especially that first one." </p>
<p>That first one, <em>Looking for Angels in New York</em> (1988), took 
        shape during Osherow's university years. She studied in literature programs—from 
        undergraduate to doctoral work—but felt compelled to write. </p>
<p>"Poetry was my secret; I just sat in a room and did it," Osherow 
        laughs. "I mean, nobody's going to stop you." Her writing (and 
        eventual submission) resulted in a pleasant surprise—winning the 
        Contemporary Poetry Series competition, meaning publication of her first 
        book. </p>
<p><em>Looking for Angels in New York</em> elicits themes and forms existent 
        throughout her career: poetry in sonnets, travels to Italy, her faith 
        and explorations of Judaism and Jewish poetry. In one poem, "Dawn," 
        she finds inspiration in New York City's buildings, in the way she will 
        later discover in Utah's blue-white mountains: "Dawn, even from a 
        midtown skyscraper, /Is beautiful. Cement and glass, as if/Still dreaming, 
        tentative. The long, lazy/Stretch of yawning stone." </p>
<p>Her second book, <em>Conversations with Survivors</em> (1994), expanded 
        more into her traditional background in Judaism, from the Yiddish language 
        to the Holocaust. "I was introduced far too young," Osherow 
        says of the Holocaust. "It was such a gigantic overwhelming presence."Osherow 
        recalls at age 7 admitting to her mother the reason she refused to take 
        showers: She feared that gas would come out of the showerhead. </p>
<p>A grown Osherow wasn't seeking accounts, but her then-husband's entire 
        family survived the Holocaust. This included his stepmother, Fany, who 
        wanted her memories documented. The result was "Conversations With 
        Survivors," a poem recalling Fany's experience during the Holocaust 
        and in present day. </p>
<p>"Brief Encounter With a Hero, Name Unknown," a poem from her 
        third book, <em>With a Moon in Transit</em> (1996), is one of her most 
        acclaimed. Osherow tells how the poem took shape: She asked her father-in-law, 
        a Holocaust survivor in charge of delousing at Birkenau (an extermination 
        camp annex of Auschwitz, the Nazi's largest concentration camp), 
        if he knew any of the SS. He told the story of Josef Schillinger, an SS 
        officer. In the tale, a woman brought to the gas chamber grabs Schillinger's 
        gun, killing him and three other guards before being gunned down herself. 
        The story haunted Osherow until she wrote the poem. Since then, "Brief 
        Encounter" has taken on a life of its own. </p>
<p><img align="left" height="309" src="http://continuum.utah.edu/back_issues/winter04/images/conversations.jpg" width="216"/>Last 
        year, Susan Gubar released <em>Poetry After Auschwitz: Remembering What 
        One Never Knew</em>, in which she discusses "Brief Encounter." 
        Gubar then mentions another account of the same incident: a Tadeusz Borowski 
        story, "The Death of Schillinger." </p>
<p>Osherow was stunned—and incredibly thrilled—to discover the 
        story had a history beyond her father-in-law's account. Merely searching 
        online, Osherow found various accounts of the incident: It occurred in 
        October 1943, and the woman was most likely a Polish dancer named Franceska 
        Mann. </p>
<p>"My mind exploded," Osherow recalls, still astonished. "I 
        thought it was something that only existed in my father-in-law's head 
        and my head. Suddenly, there was external proof." It also lends insight 
        to the way Osherow writes poetry: It's about conversations, stories and 
        experiences, not historic research. </p>
<p>"I hear it, I'm relating a story I was told, it's a personal thing," 
        Osherow explains. "It's all about memory." </p>
<p>This July, Osherow's efforts as a poet and teacher led to her appointment 
        as a Distinguished Professor of English and Creative Writing. In Osherow's 
        view it is an honor and a testament to "the University's tremendous 
        support." Support from the university and her colleagues has enabled 
        Osherow to "write poems that could not have been written" without 
        grants and fellowships. </p>
<p>Among her honors are fellowships from the Guggenheim Foundation (1997-98) 
        and the National Endowment for the Arts (1999-2000). Osherow's poetry 
        appeared in <em>Best American Poetry in 1995</em> (for "Late Night 
        Tête-à-tête with a Moon in Transit") and in 1998 
        (for "Views of La Leggenda della Vera Croce"), and she has published 
        many others in journals and magazines, including <em>Paris Review</em>, 
        <em>The New Republic</em> and <em>The New Yorker</em>. </p>
<p>When asked about the accolades, she returns to her new title, grinning 
        while sharing a story of how her daughter Dora reacted to the honor: "Mom, 
        you're the least distinguished person I know." </p>
<p>The poet's fifth book, <em>The Hoopoe's Crown</em>, comes in 2005 from 
        BOA Editions. Included are poems about a subject and place she has never 
        explored—Israel. Osherow, who spent most of her career writing in 
        forms such as terza rima and sonnets, is trying more free verse in her 
        most recent outing.</p>
<p> "Israel is so austere," Osherow says. "I could not do 
        my usual things. That landscape doesn't fit any of these generous English 
        forms." She is excited by these challenges in her continued explorations 
        of place and experiences in Judaism.</p>
<p>"You should write whatever you're obsessed by," Osherow 
        says. "You should take it on, and that's what I'm trying 
        to do." </p>
