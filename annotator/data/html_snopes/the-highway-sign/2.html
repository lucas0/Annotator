The ISTEA states that Oklahoma can submit US 75-69 from the TX line to
I-40 at Checotah, OK as an interstate whenever it's ready for it, and
since US 75 is interstate from Dallas on up to the border, and since
I-45 ends and US 75 immediately picks up, then expect I-45 to be
extended along that path soon.
<p>
In fact, I propose extending I-45 from there to Muskogee, OK to Vinita,
OK through east Kansas along US 69 all the way up to <a href="http://www.ihoz.com/I35.html">I-35</a> (where 
the US 69 freeway ends now) in the Kansas suburban side of Kansas City.
