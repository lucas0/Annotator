<h1>Notes</h1>
This is one of my all time favourite roads.  It's the only Interstate 
that actually runs from Canada to Mexico, and it goes through many 
interesting places in between.  It starts down in San Diego and cuts up 
through beach cities along the coast for a while.  The Inspection 
Checkpoint south of LA is the least annoying one I have ever been 
through; they barely even look at the passengers due to the traffic. (It 
must be said that the "Pedestrians Running Across the Road Warning signs 
would still get the point across without being Mexican charactures.)
<p>
Around the time that you're getting bored with expensive beachfront 
property, you hit urban hell.  What is a major highway without a few 
spraypainted over exit signs.  It is in LA where you get the one exit in 
the nearly 800 miles of I-5 in CA that they bothered to give an exit 
number to.  
</p><p>
North of LA is where you finally (under the old laws) get a 65 zone.  The 
character of the land changes once again as I-5 cedes the Pacific to US 
101 and goes inland into the desert.  While this stretch is much more 
bearable than I-15 to Las Vegas, it's still can remind you of jokes about 
mirages.
</p><p>
When you hit the Bay Area, you get the first sign that things are 
beginning to change.  Around Sacramento the signs about using reclaimed 
water to water the grass start to disapear.  The run up to Redding is 
quite pleasant, as trees start to become much more prevalent.  If you are 
at all tired though, Redding is where you should grab a nap; the rough 
stretch is coming.
</p><p>
For the next 200 miles or so, I-5 suddenly resembles Colorado.  While the 
speed limit stays pretty constant the whole time, there are quite a few 
twists, turns, and slopes.  However the real danger is not the mountains 
we go over, but the one off to our right.  Mt Shasta is very hard to not 
stare at as you drive, but by resisting the temptation you can make it to 
Yreka and stop at the Yreka Bakery.  The rest is needed, because we've 
got another pass at the Oregon border, and the fog is beginning to creep in.
</p><p>
By the time you hit Roseburg, I-5 flattens and straightens out.  When the 
rain starts in Eugene, you realise that you are in the Pacific 
Northwest.  Deciding not to stop at the college town, you head up past 
the industrial looking city of Portland.  Singing "Roll on Columbia, roll 
on," you cross into Washington.
</p><p>
Southern Washington state is quite rural.  The area is mainly farmland, 
and the Uncle Sam sign in Centralia reminds you of the conservative 
politics that the farming community is supposed to have.  However, as 
there is a time to reap and a time to sow, there is a place for farms and 
a place for cities.  It may look like Indiana, but the mountains on the 
horizon let you know that you are barely south of Olympia.  Once you're 
past there, it's just a hop, step, and a jump to Seattle.  While you 
could bypass the city on I-405, staying on I-5 lets you go right by the 
Space Needle.
</p><p>
Once north of Seattle, all of the signs start reading Vancouver.  While 
there still is some beautiful scenery and the rather interesting town of 
Bellingham to go through, billboards for duty free shops and Victoria BC 
begin to infest the side of the road.  After all of that, reaching Blaine 
is almost anti-climatic.... until you see the backup at the border.
