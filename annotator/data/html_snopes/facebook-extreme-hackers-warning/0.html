information on the content provider), users are required to appropriately fulfill the respective
labeling and information duties.
</dd>
<dt>5.4.</dt>
<dd>The Service Provider has the right to remove non-relevant content, in particular content that does

range of games).
</dd>
<dt>5.5.</dt>
<dd>If users can directly contact and invite other users, this contact and invitation option may not be
used for advertising purposes or to otherwise harass the contacted users (for example, through repeated

stated). The Service Provider reserves the right to restrict the function both generally and in
individual cases if users should feel harassed.
</dd>
<dt>5.6.</dt>
<dd>The Service Provider reserves the right not to release content or to reverse the release thereof if
there is concrete evidence to suggest that the content is in breach of statutory regulations, official
prohibitions, the rights of third parties or public morality. The Service Provider is not, however,
obliged to verify the content in advance.

<dt>6.1.</dt>
<dd>The Service Provider is neither responsible nor liable for user-generated content or for linked

</dd>
<dt>6.2.</dt>
<dd>The Service Provider wishes to point out that no claim is made regarding the accuracy,

information and/or advice and/or results contained within. The content, the IQ and knowledge tests
and all other tests, quizzes and horoscopes are non-scientific fun-content and can never replace
medical diagnoses, scientific testing methods or professional advice.</b> Such content is to be
understood as non-binding information, recommendations and statements. In particular, no guarantee is
offered that the content of the Service can be used in each country in which it is available. This
restriction is due to the global nature of the Internet.

ratings.
</dd>
<dt>6.4.</dt>

content and the criteria by which they have found fault with it, and apply for the correction or
deletion of such content. The Service Provider may forward the complaint to the users responsible for

caution to a user, c) the restriction of the use of applications, d) the temporary blocking of a user,

non-sublicensable license for Publishing of any Publishing Items made available for Publishing within

Publisher's Site of any Publishing Advertisements, our ToS, our privacy policy or any other first-party

</dl>
</dd>
<dt>12.</dt>
<dd><p><strong>Remuneration and Billing</strong></p>
<dl>
<dt>12.1.</dt>
<dd>The provisions of this section apply if a contract is concluded between the user and the Service
Provider for the provision of fee-based services. If the acquisition and payment processes are to be
carried out via a third-party service provider (such as Apple iTunes or Google Play), the contractual
terms of said provider will apply in this regard and take priority over the regulations in this section.
</dd>
<dt>12.2.</dt>
<dd>The remuneration currently owed is based on the chosen plan and is quoted net. Statutory VAT
applicable at the time of invoicing is charged in addition. The remuneration is due to payment at the
beginning of each payment interval.
</dd>
<dt>12.3.</dt>
<dd>We reserve the right to change the scale of remuneration at any time. With regard to current
contracts, such change shall take effect only from the beginning of the following contracting period.
</dd>
<dt>12.4.</dt>
<dd>You may settle the remuneration using one of the payment methods we have offered to you.</dd>
<dt>12.5.</dt>
<dd>The period for submission of pre-notifications by the provider to the customer within the SEPA
Direct Debit scheme is two days.
</dd>
<dt>12.6.</dt>
<dd>You will be provided with the invoices electronically.</dd>
<dt>12.7.</dt>
<dd>Should it not be possible to have an invoice paid by direct debit, you shall bear all
consequential costs. These include especially bank charges in connection with the return of direct
debits and comparable fees to the extent that you are responsible for the event that triggers the costs.
We can send you payment reminders electronically.
</dd>
<dt>12.8.</dt>
<dd>Should you fall into arrears with your payments, we have the right to refuse to fulfill payments
due to you and to block access to the user account until such default has been rectified. In such cases
we will normally notify you of such at least 10 working days in advance to rectify such default. In the
case of users who are consumers, the arrears must not be only marginally and the blocking must not be
unreasonable for the user. Our other legal and contractual rights with regard to payment delay shall
remain unaffected.
</dd>
<dt>12.9.</dt>
<dd>Should you fall into arrears with your payment, you must expect to be charged 5% interest for late
payment above the base interest rate effective for the place of our registered office. Default interest
will be charged, even without a written warning, if the payment is not made at the agreed date. We
reserve the right to raise a claim for a higher value of compensation for such delay.
</dd>
<dt>12.10.</dt>
<dd>You may offset only uncontested or legally binding debts against our claims, insofar as these are
not claims for completion or the rectification of faults. You are entitled to a right of retention only
for counterclaims arising from the contract that forms the basis of these ToS.
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dt>13.</dt>
<dd><p><strong>Termination</strong></p>
<dl>
<dt>13.1.</dt>
<dd>A termination of the contract is possible at any time on the free-of-charge plan.</dd>
<dt>13.2.</dt>
<dd>In case of fee-based plans the contract term for the use of our Service is determined for
chargeable plans by the selected payment interval. Unless otherwise stated, the contract will be
prolonged automatically upon the expiry of the contract term by the same period, insofar as it has not
been previously terminated giving notice of seven days before contract termination.
</dd>
<dt>13.3.</dt>
<dd>Users can object to any consent to receive e-mails and messages in the context of the Service.</dd>
<dt>12.4.</dt>
<dd>If users desist from using a function or a platform version of the Service (such as the Facebook
application but not the mobile application), this is not tantamount to the cancellation of the entire
Service. Users can declare their cancellation of the entire Service by notifying the Service Provider
and, where applicable to the Service in question, through the use of cancellation or account deletion
options, and also by clicking on the termination or "unsubscribe" link of, or, as the case may be, in
the e-mails of the Service.
</dd>
<dt>13.5.</dt>
<dd>Both contracting parties reserve the right to an early extraordinary termination of the contract
for important reasons. An extraordinary termination is permitted in particular where you remain in
default with your payment obligations for two months. Where necessary, a written warning concerning the
objectionable conduct must precede the extraordinary termination.
</dd>
<dt>13.6.</dt>
<dd>In case of contract termination, you are responsible for saving your data before your contract
expires.
</dd>
<dt>13.7.</dt>
<dd>
For the avoidance of doubt, termination of our services Service shall not limit us from pursuing
other remedies to which we are entitled under these Publisher Terms and Conditions, any other agreement
or under any applicable law, including, without limitation, any injunctive relief.
</dd>
<dt>13.8.</dt>
<dd>Posts and comments, their content and other comparable content will remain within the Service out
of consideration for other users if this is required, for example, to ensure that the meaning of
conversations or advice or the like is not lost or inverted. Such content can be removed individually on
request.
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dt>14.</dt>
<dd><p><strong>Changes in Service</strong></p>
<dl>
<dt>14.1.</dt>
<dd>The scope of the Service we are offering, the user accounts and their technical design are derived
from the current technical status of our Service and the description of services at the time of contract
conclusion.
</dd>
<dt>14.2.</dt>
<dd>We reserve the right to extend, change or limit functions on the following grounds: a) if the changes
are merely beneficial for users; b) if the changes serve to adjust the services with the applicable law,
in particular if the legal situation changes; b) if the changes serve to comply with compelling legal or
regulatory judgments; c) the respective change is necessary so far as to close existing security gaps;
e) if the changes are of a purely technical or procedural nature with no significant impact for the user.
Changes with only an insignificant impact on existing features do not represent "Changes in Service" as
understood within limits of these ToS. This applies especially to changes of purely optical kind and mere
changes in the arrangement of functions.
</dd>
<dt>14.3.</dt>
<dd>Where such change in the scope of functions impairs your contractual use of our Service to a more
than negligible degree, you have the right to a fee adjustment or the termination of your contract.
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dt>15.</dt>
<dd><p><strong>Availability</strong></p>
<dl>
<dt>15.1.</dt>
<dd>You hereby acknowledge that a 100% availability of our Service cannot be technically assured.
However, we shall strive to keep our Service available as consistently as possible and assure you of an
annual average availability of 98% in accordance with the following limitations in this section.
</dd>
<dt>15.2.</dt>
<dd>We cannot ensure the availability of our Service during times in which it cannot be accessed due
to technical or other problems that lie outside our sphere of influence (Force Majeure, third-party
culpability, necessary maintenance etc.). Where the safety of the network or the maintenance of network
integrity is endangered for reasons beyond our sphere of responsibility, we can temporarily limit access
to our Service as required.
</dd>
<dt>15.3.</dt>
<dd>You will be notified of foreseeable downtimes due to maintenance work in good time in advance.
Claims in this respect can therefore not be deduced.

liabilities and legal fees, from any claim or demand made by any third party arising out of or relating
to (i) user's access to or use of our Service, (ii) your violation of the ToS, (iii) any products or

<dl>
<dt>18.1.</dt>
<dd>ARBITRATION AN CLASS ACTION CLAUSE: YOU AGREE THAT ALL DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND US (WHETHER OR NOT SUCH
DISPUTE INVOLVES A THIRD PARTY) WITH REGARD TO YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH US, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION
DISPUTES RELATED TO THIS USER AGREEMENT, YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES, AND/OR RIGHTS OF PRIVACY AND/OR PUBLICITY,
WILL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING, INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION AND YOU WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION
LAWSUIT OR CLASS-WIDE ARBITRATION. YOU ARE GIVING UP THE RIGHT TO LITIGATE A DISPUTE IN COURT BEFORE A JUDGE
OR JURY. “DISPUTE” INCLUDES ANY DISPUTE, CONTROVERSY, OR ACTION BETWEEN YOU AND US CONCERNING OUR CONTENT
PLATFORMS OR SERVICES, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, WARRANTY, TORT, STATUTE OR REGULATION, OR OTHER LEGAL OR EQUITABLE
BASIS. IF WE ARE NOT ABLE TO RESOLVE ANY SUCH DISPUTE VIA INFORMAL NEGOTIATIONS OR SMALL CLAIMS COURT, THE
DISPUTE WILL BE SETTLED BY BINDING ARBITRATION BEFORE A NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR WHOSE DECISION WILL BE FINAL EXCEPT
FOR A LIMITED RIGHT OF APPEAL UNDER THE U.S. FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT. IF THE CLASS ACTION WAIVER IS FOUND TO BE
ILLEGAL OR UNENFORCEABLE AS TO ALL OR SOME PARTS OF A DISPUTE, THOSE PARTS WILL BE SEVERED AND PROCEED IN A COURT
OF LAW, WITH THE REMAINING PARTS PROCEEDING IN ARBITRATION. ARBITRATION WILL BE ADMINISTERED BY UNDER THE AMERICAN
ARBITRATION ASSOCIATION'S RULES FOR ARBITRATION OF CONSUMER-RELATED DISPUTES AND YOU AND WE HEREBY EXPRESSLY
WAIVE TRIAL BY JURY. DISCOVERY AND RIGHTS TO APPEAL IN ARBITRATION ARE GENERALLY MORE LIMITED THAN IN A LAWSUIT,
AND OTHER RIGHTS THAT YOU AND WE WOULD HAVE IN COURT MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE IN ARBITRATION. AS AN ALTERNATIVE, YOU
MAY BRING YOUR CLAIM IN YOUR LOCAL "SMALL CLAIMS" COURT, IF PERMITTED BY THAT SMALL CLAIMS COURT'S RULES AND IF
WITHIN SUCH COURT'S JURISDICTION, UNLESS SUCH ACTION IS TRANSFERRED, REMOVED OR APPEALED TO A DIFFERENT COURT.
YOU MAY BRING CLAIMS ONLY ON YOUR OWN BEHALF. NEITHER YOU NOR WE WILL PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION OR CLASS-WIDE
ARBITRATION FOR ANY CLAIMS COVERED BY THIS AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE. YOU ARE GIVING UP YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE AS
A CLASS REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS MEMBER ON ANY CLASS CLAIM YOU MAY HAVE AGAINST US INCLUDING ANY RIGHT TO CLASS
ARBITRATION OR ANY CONSOLIDATION OF INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATIONS. YOU ALSO AGREE NOT TO PARTICIPATE IN CLAIMS BROUGHT
IN A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL OR REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY, OR CONSOLIDATED CLAIMS INVOLVING ANOTHER PERSON'S
ACCOUNT, IF WE ARE A PARTY TO THE PROCEEDING. THIS DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROVISION WILL BE GOVERNED BY THE FEDERAL
ARBITRATION ACT AND NOT BY ANY STATE LAW CONCERNING ARBITRATION. IN THE EVENT THE AMERICAN ARBITRATION
ASSOCIATION IS UNWILLING OR UNABLE TO SET A HEARING DATE WITHIN ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY (160) DAYS OF FILING THE
CASE, THEN EITHER WE OR YOU CAN ELECT TO HAVE THE ARBITRATION ADMINISTERED INSTEAD BY THE JUDICIAL ARBITRATION
AND MEDIATION SERVICES. JUDGMENT ON THE AWARD RENDERED BY THE ARBITRATOR MAY BE ENTERED IN ANY COURT HAVING
COMPETENT JURISDICTION. ANY PROVISION OF APPLICABLE LAW NOTWITHSTANDING, THE ARBITRATOR WILL NOT HAVE AUTHORITY
TO AWARD DAMAGES, REMEDIES OR AWARDS THAT CONFLICT WITH THIS USER AGREEMENT.
</dd>
<dt>18.2.</dt>
<dd>SEVERABILITY CLAUSE CONCERNING CLAS ACTIONS AND ARBITRATION: IF THE PROHIBITION AGAINST CLASS ACTIONS AND OTHER
CLAIMS BROUGHT ON BEHALF OF THIRD PARTIES CONTAINED ABOVE IS FOUND TO BE UNENFORCEABLE, THEN ALL OF THE PRECEDING
LANGUAGE IN THIS ARBITRATION SECTION WILL BE NULL AND VOID. THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT WILL SURVIVE THE TERMINATION
OF YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH US.
</dd>
<dt>18.3.</dt>

HOWEVER IT IS APPLICABLE AS LONG AS CUSTOMERS RESORT TO US-JURISDICTION SEEKING FOR CLASS ACTIONS AND/OR AGREEMENTS
