<h2>President Bush Celebrates African American History Month</h2>
<p>"Throughout African American History Month, we remember how individuals, African American leaders of all kinds helped bring our nation together. We recognize our nation still has a long way to go. But in the example of the leaders like those we honor today, we see strength greater than any division. And we see hope for a day when freedom rings from every mountainside, and every corner of the country."</p>

<h2>National African American History Month, 2008</h2>
<p>A Proclamation by the President of the United States of America</p>
<p>During National African American History Month, we honor the achievements and celebrate the rich heritage of African Americans. </p>
<p>Throughout our Nation's history, African Americans from all walks of life have offered their talents to the betterment of American society. Scholars such as Frederick Douglass and W.E.B. DuBois were early leaders who placed great importance on educating all people about the need for justice and racial equality. Athletes such as Jackie Robinson and Althea Gibson persevered while breaking the color barrier and competing at the highest levels of sports. Musicians like Nat King Cole and Billie Holiday lifted the American spirit with their creativity and musical gifts. Through their extraordinary accomplishments, these leaders helped bring our Nation closer to fulfilling its founding ideals. </p>
<p>This year's theme, "Carter G. Woodson and the Origins of Multiculturalism," honors an educator who taught his fellow citizens about the traditions and contributions of African Americans. His dedication to educating Americans about cultural diversity initiated this celebration of African-American history. Our Nation is now stronger and more hopeful because generations of leaders like him have worked to help America live up to its promise of equality and the great truth that all of God's children are created equal. </p>
<p>Throughout African American History Month, we celebrate the many contributions African Americans have made to our Nation, and we are reminded of their courage in their struggle to change the hearts and minds of our citizens. While much progress has been made, we must continue to work together to achieve the promise and vision of our great Nation.</p>

		<h2>President Bush Participates in Volunteer Service Event on Martin Luther King, Jr. Day</h2>
<p>"One of the things that Mrs. King wanted was for MLK Day to be a day of service. It is not a day off, but it's a day on. ... I encourage people all around the country to seize any opportunity they can to help somebody in need. And by helping somebody in need, you're honoring the legacy of Martin Luther King."</p>
	<p align="right">- President George W. Bush<br>January 15, 2007</p></br>


		<h2>President Bush Attends Ceremonial Groundbreaking of the Martin Luther King, Jr. National Memorial</h2>
<p>"We have gathered in tribute to Dr. Martin Luther King, to the ideals he held and to the life he lived. Dr. King showed us that a life of conscience and purpose can lift up many souls. And on this ground, a monument will rise that preserves his legacy for the ages. Honoring Dr. King's legacy requires more than building a monument; it required the ongoing commitment of every American. So we will continue to work for the day when the dignity and humanity of every person is respected, and the American promise is denied no one."</p>
	<p align="right">- President George W. Bush<br>November 13, 2006</p></br>


		<h2>President Bush Signs H.R. 9, The Fannie Lou Hamer, Rosa Parks, And Coretta Scott King Voting Rights Act Reauthorization And Amendments Act Of 2006</h2>
<p>"In four decades since the Voting Rights Act was first passed, we've made progress toward equality, yet the work for a more perfect union is never ending. We'll continue to build on the legal equality won by the civil rights movement to help ensure that every person enjoys the opportunity that this great land of liberty offers. And that means a decent education and a good school for every child, a chance to own their own home or business, and the hope that comes from knowing that you can rise in our society by hard work and God-given talents."</p>
	<p align="right">- President George W. Bush<br>July 27, 2006</p></br>


<h2>Fact Sheet: Voting Rights Act Reauthorization and Amendments Act of 2006</h2>

<p><strong>On July 27, 2006, The President Signed Into Law The Fannie Lou Hamer, Rosa Parks, And
Coretta Scott King Voting Rights Act Reauthorization And Amendments Act Of
2006.</strong>  The Voting Rights Act of 1965 (VRA) was designed to restore the
birthright of every American - the right to choose our leaders.  It has
been vital to guaranteeing the right to vote for generations of Americans
and has helped millions of our citizens enjoy the full promise of freedom.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>In Signing This Bill, President Bush Honored The Memory Of Three Women Who
      Devoted Their Lives To The Struggle For Civil Rights - Fannie Lou Hamer,
    Rosa Parks, And Coretta Scott King.</strong>  The Voting Rights Act Reauthorization
    and Amendments Act of 2006 was named in honor of these three American
    heroes.</li>
</ul>

<p class="underln">The Voting Rights Act Reauthorization And Amendments Act Of 2006 Reaffirms A Commitment To Enforce The Right To Vote For All Americans</p>

<p><strong>The Voting Rights Act Reauthorization And Amendments Act Of 2006 Extends The VRA For 25 Years, Extending:  </strong></p>

<ul>
  <li> The prohibition against the use of tests or devices to deny the right to
    vote in any Federal, State, or local election; and </li>
  <li> The requirement for certain States and local governments to provide voting
    materials in multiple languages. </li>
</ul>

<p class="underln">The New Law Also Amends The VRA With Regard To:</p>

<ul>
	<li> The use of election examiners and observers; </li>
  	<li> Voting qualifications or standards intended to diminish, or with the effect of diminishing, the ability of U.S. citizens on account of race or color to elect preferred candidates; and </li>
  	<li> Award of attorney fees in enforcement proceedings to include expert fees and other reasonable costs of litigation. </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The President Has Committed His Administration To Vigorously Enforce The
Provisions Of This Law And To Defend It In Court.  The President will also
continue to work with Congress to ensure that our country lives up to our
guiding principle that all men and women are created equal.  </strong></p>

<p><strong>The Administration Will Continue To Build On The Legacy Of The Civil Rights
Movement To Help Ensure That Every Child Enjoys The Opportunities America
Offers.</strong>  These opportunities include the right to a decent education in a
good school, the chance to own a home or small business, and the hope that
comes from knowing you can rise in our society through hard work and using
your talents.</p>

<p class="underln">History Of The Voting Rights Act Of 1965</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>In March 1965, African Americans Marched Across The Edmund Pettus Bridge In Selma, Alabama, To Protest The Unfair And Racist Practices That Kept Them Off The Voter Rolls.  </strong></li>
	<li><strong>When The Marchers Reached The Far Side Of The Bridge, They Were Met By
      State Troopers And A Civilian Posse Bearing Tear Gas, Billy Clubs, And
    Whips. </strong>This group brutally attacked the peacefully protesting men, women,
    and children.</li>
  <li><strong>One Week After The Selma Incident, President Johnson Announced That He Planned To Submit Legislation That Would Bring African Americans Into The Civic Life Of Our Nation.  </strong></li>
  <li>
    <strong>Five Months After Selma, President Johnson Signed The Voting Rights Act
    Into Law.</strong>  For some parts of our country, the Voting Rights Act marked the
    first appearance of African Americans on the voting rolls since
    Reconstruction following the Civil War.

			President's Message African American History Month 2008</p>
<h4>History</h4>
<p><span class="alert">Celebrating Community</span><br/>A Tribute to Black Fraternal, Social, and Civic Institutions, recognizes the African-American groups that have worked to confront injustices and expand opportunities. These organizations believe in the potential and worth of every person, and they have worked to help all Americans receive a quality education, to feed the hungry and house the homeless, to encourage youth to make healthy choices, and to reach out to others in need. By answering the call to love a neighbor as we would like to be loved ourselves, these groups have set a positive example, and we continue to be inspired by their compassion and service to others.</p>
