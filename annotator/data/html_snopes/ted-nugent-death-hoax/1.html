In Dallas, Micah Xavier Johnson, a Black Lives Matter activist wielding a Sig Sauer MCX rifle, killed five police officers and injured seven others. Nugent wrote on Facebook that President Barack Obama “<a href="http://mm4a.org/29taxwV">wants a racewar</a>” and that he “<a href="http://mm4a.org/29taxwV">will go down in history as a maniac America hating freak with his fundemental (sic) transformation scam</a>.” When a commenter implored him to respect President Barack Obama and help rather than criticize him, Nugent responded, "<a href="http://mm4a.org/29taxwV">He is the enemy of America &amp; it is our WE THE PEOPLE [sic] duty to oust his evil ass. wake the fkup [sic] sheep</a>." Nugent later stated, "<a href="http://mm4a.org/29taxwV">Blacks slaughtering blacks at an unprecedented rate. Blacks killed more blacks this week than the KKK has in 50yrs. braindead goofballs</a>.” When another commenter asked Nugent why the NRA had not commented on the shooting of Philando Castile yet, given that he “<a href="http://mm4a.org/29taxwV">was doing what any law abiding gun owners would do</a>,” Nugent replied, "<a href="http://mm4a.org/29taxwV">Not really. review the facts</a>" and linked to an article at TheConservativeTreehouse.com that <a href="http://www.snopes.com/philando-castile-was-not-wanted-for-armed-robbery/">falsely reported</a> that Castile was the suspect in an armed robbery case at the time of his death.</div><p class="state_text tRight"><strong><em>2016-07-09</em></strong></p><hr/></li>

An enraged wild boar charged me in the forest, so I shot it with my bow and arrow, killed it and ate it. One time in Alaska a very large black bear stood on its hind legs only 10 feet away, so I killed him with my .44 magnum, ate the meat and made a beautiful rug. A shark circled my in the Keys one time, so I put an arrow through its heart, ate it and had it mounted. In my 66 years as a natural hunter, I’ve had too many encounters with large, wild animals to count, but never had a problem with any of them. My encounters were natural, real-world encounters as predator and prey, hunter and hunted, the way God intended it. Chimps and lions, cheetahs and cougars, deer and other wild animals are not pets. If you disrespect wildlife enough to reduce them to pets, you are asking for trouble. And if you drive through a wild animal park with your windows rolled down in defiance of ubiquitous, common-sense rules and regulations, you have a very good chance of being attacked and dying.

The Nazis’ idea was that the public was more likely to believe a big, bold lie as opposed to a small one. “<a href="http://www.wnd.com/2015/05/the-real-danger-to-kids-this-summer-its-not-guns/">According to the Centers for Disease Control, drowning is the leading cause of death for kids 1-4 years old and is the second-leading cause of unintentional deaths for kids 1-14 years old … Wow</a>,” wrote Nugent in his column. “<a href="http://www.wnd.com/2015/05/the-real-danger-to-kids-this-summer-its-not-guns/">And Mr. Obama has worked overtime to convince Americans that kids are being slaughtered with guns</a>.” A <em>Mother Jones</em> report about accidental shootings in 2013 found “<a href="http://mediamatters.org/blog/2015/05/14/ted-nugent-the-big-lie-about-guns-is-that-innoc/203652">84 fatal gun accidents involving children aged 12 and under, 64 of which involved a child pulling the trigger, killing themselves or someone else</a>.” Another <a href="http://issuu.com/cdfweb/docs/protect_children_not_guns_2013?e=3139395/3981849">report</a> estimated that the rate of accidental death by firearms among children is 17 times higher than in 25 other high-income nations combined.</div><p class="state_text tRight"><strong><em>2015-05-13</em></strong></p><hr/></li>

<ul>
<li>“Look at this audience. Couldn’t we end the War on Terror ourselves? And I’ll play Commander in Chief for a minute. Here’s rules of engagement. Kill ‘em all.”</li>
<li>We’re a little spoiled in Texas and Arizona and Wyoming and Vermont. Can you be spoiled in Vermont? And Kansas. We’re starting to get something that looks like the Second Amendment in some places, because it doesn’t exist anywhere yet.</li>
<li>That’s the Second Amendment. If you’re 18 and you’re not convicted of a felony or a violent crime you get to keep and you get to bear 24/7/365 anywhere you damn well please.</li>
<li>My name’s Ted Nugent. I’m 66 years old and I’ve never been in a gun-free zone.       Ever.</li>
<li>I cannot comprehend the soullessness of unarmed and helpless.</li>
<li>So the community scammer [President Barack Obama] didn’t get to be the Commander in Chief because he’s clever. [Democratic presidential candidate] Hillary Clinton, [National Security Advisor] Susan Rice and [IRS employee] Lois Lerner aren’t in jail yet because they’re sneaky. They commit their crimes in the wide open and We The People have failed to arrest them yet.</li>
<li>Whatever we want is always the right thing.</li>
<li>Here’s the only gun law we need: Don’t shoot the wrong guy.</li>
<li>Back when Richard Pryor’s afro caught on fire, I knew I was on the mountaintop of comedy … But thank God the liberal media has actually gotten funnier than Richard Pryor’s afro igniting.</li>
<li>Don’t back away from the storm. Look for the storm. Put your head down and walk proudly right into the storm. Let the wimps and the French back away. You just keep plowing forward, the higher the drifts, the worse the wind, the more wolves, kill ‘em all.</li>
<li>Go forth into that quiet night and let our government know we want separation of powers. Tell them to be the watchdogs our Founding Fathers wanted them to be, not to be a united force against the citizens. So take this good [guns] and use it against the bad and the ugly. It’s a target rich environment. If it was duck season, there’d be so many ducks, you could just close your eyes and shoot ‘em. Don’t close your eyes and don’t shoot just yet, but plow forward and demand accountability … So now let’s take all that good and crush the bad and the ugly, when we identify the gun-grabbers and freedom-haters.</li>
<li>If your child is dying, and there’s only one way to get to the doctor, would you get on [Senate Minority Leader] Harry Reid’s boat to get there? Then your child’s dead. I’d get on the boat, get there, and then I’d shoot him.</li>
<li>[When asked by an audience member how one should respond to law enforcement officers enforcing a law that would involve the seizure of firearms]: “You don’t need to get shot, you don’t need to start a firefight, yet.” (Vigilantism, Political Violence, Racism, GOP Ties, Conspiracy Theory]</li>

Bush administration in 2008. “<a href="http://mediamatters.org/blog/2015/04/07/military-suicide-experts-ted-nugent-veteran-cla/203188">It's politicizing the serious public health problem and it is a disservice to the men and women who serve this country. [President Barack Obama] has done more in the last few years than any other administration has done to try to understand and prevent suicide in the veteran population</a>.” The executive director of the National Center for Veterans Studies at the University of Utah, Craig J. Bryan, added, "<a href="http://mediamatters.org/blog/2015/04/07/military-suicide-experts-ted-nugent-veteran-cla/203188">It's a pretty ridiculous comment … First off, there's absolutely no scientific evidence backing that up. Suicide is much more complex than simply being angry at a politician. We have been studying suicide for close to eight or nine years on military personnel and veterans and I've never heard a single military person use that as a reason they were suicidal or want to kill themselves … We're at a point where we are actually making progress, comments like this kind of demeans the suffering of service members and veterans.

In some urban areas, over 50 percent of black kids drop out of high school, thereby condemning themselves to a life of poverty and dependence, a prison cell or an early grave. This is not a redeemable family value. Dependency on welfare breeds more dependency, which breeds more despair, hopelessness and anger.

The federal voting loophole is this: People who pay no federal income taxes are allowed to vote in federal elections. Arguably, this is a ‘loophole’ since these voters have no federal income tax flesh in the game. The producers who pay more than our fair share believe that it is grossly unfair for those who pay no federal income taxes to be able to vote in federal elections determining how other Americans’ hard-earned tax dollars are spent</a>.” The “Gun Show Loophole” refers to private sales of firearms that are conducted at gun shows without background checks.  </p></div><p class="state_text tRight"><strong><em>2014-02-04</em></strong></p><hr/></li>

I don't think we are prejudging. I think we are taking evidence, and going, 'Uh-oh black clouds coming in, wind is picking up, I think I better head for a shelter.’ … I think when you use the word ‘profile,’ if a Dalmatian has been biting the children in the neighborhood, I think we're going to look for a black and white dog. The gangs of blacks lately that have been just been going down the downtown streets and breaking windows on cars. Over and over again, I watch the news, and here's a rape and here's a burglary and here's a murder in Chicago. Twenty-nine shot, 29 blacks shot by 29 blacks. At some point, you've gotta be afraid of black and white dogs if the Dalmatian is doing the biting</a>." </p></div><p class="state_text tRight"><strong><em>2014-02-04</em></strong></p><hr/></li>

Nugent stated, “<a href="http://rare.us/story/nugent-zimmerman-should-sue-trayvons-parents/" target="blank">Mr. Zimmerman may also face a wrongful-death civil suit brought by Trayvon Martin’s family, who refuse to admit their son was a troublemaker who brought about his own demise</a>.” He suggested that Zimmerman should sue Martin’s family for “<a href="http://rare.us/story/nugent-zimmerman-should-sue-trayvons-parents/" target="blank">emotional pain and suffering</a>.”  “<a href="http://rare.us/story/nugent-zimmerman-should-sue-trayvons-parents/" target="blank">Trayvon Martin’s vicious attack on George Zimmerman and Martin’s tragic death have no doubt surely dragged Mr. Zimmerman through 18 months of untold emotional hell, pain, distress, anguish, fatigue, nightmares and financial ruin</a>,” added Nugent.  “<a href="http://rare.us/story/nugent-zimmerman-should-sue-trayvons-parents/" target="blank">Parents can be held responsible for the actions of their minor-age children until the children reach the age of majority (meaning adulthood), which is exactly why Mr. Zimmerman should explore filing a lawsuit against Martin’s parents. The age of majority in Florida is 18-years-old. Trayon Martin was 17-years-old when he attacked Mr. Zimmerman, which potentially means that Trayvon’s parents may possibly be held responsible for the stress, emotional pain and anguish their son caused George Zimmerman</a>.” </p></div><p class="state_text tRight"><strong><em>2013-07-18</em></strong></p><hr/></li>

An <a href="http://www.state.gov/documents/organization/202446.pdf" target="blank">investigation</a> by the State Department Accountability Review Board found that mistakes were made in the response to the attacks, but that those decisions <a href="http://www.wjla.com/articles/2013/05/hillary-clinton-defended-by-diplomat-about-benghazi-88695.html" target="blank">were not made at the level of Secretary of State</a>.

<li class="inner_topic clearfix"><div class="categories" title=""><strong></strong></div><div class="state_text"><p>On May 8, 2013, in a column for World Net Daily, Nugent wrote that his "Nuge Immigration Plan" should be implemented because "<a href="http://www.wnd.com/2013/05/the-5-year-nuge-immigration-plan/" target="blank">We don't need any more bloodsuckers</a>."  He also suggested that America "<a href="http://www.wnd.com/2013/05/the-5-year-nuge-immigration-plan/" target="blank">apply Sherriff Joe Arpaio justice</a>" to anyone who has been deported for committing a crime and caught trying to re-enter the country.  According to Nugent, "<a href="http://www.wnd.com/2013/05/the-5-year-nuge-immigration-plan/" target="blank">The anchor baby scam should be immediately rescinded. You don't need to be a constitutional expert like our President to know that the original intent of the 14th Amendment was not to provide citizenship to illegal women or their babies who are born on American soil</a>." </p>
<p>The “Anchor Baby” narrative pushed by Nugent is largely a <a href="http://swampland.time.com/2010/08/11/dispelling-anchor-baby-myths/" target="blank">myth</a>.  Most families immigrate to the United States for simple economic reasons, not to have children. Sheriff Joe Arpaio is a sheriff working along the Arizona-Mexico border.  In 2011 a Justice Department <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/justice/2011/12/15/390264/despite-stonewalling-doj-uncovers-rampant-lawbreaking-by-sheriff-joe-arpaio/" target="blank">report</a> found that Arpaio had committed wide ranging civil rights violations and instituted racial profiling.  In May, 2013 a federal judge <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/25/us/federal-judge-finds-violations-of-rights-by-sheriff-joe-arpaio.html?_r=0" target="blank">ruled</a> that Arpaio had violated the rights of Latinos by targeting them during raids and police stops. </p>

Instead of electing a serious-minded, proven professional, America went once again with a guy whose most impressive qualification is that of a questionable ‘Chicago’ community organizer.  I don’t mean Chicago in a geographic sense.  President John F. Kennedy would have been appalled … We have decayed into a nation of gluttonous, soulless pigs who feast on whatever Fedzilla provides by taking from one group of Americans (the producers) and giving to others (the takers) who haven’t earned it and don’t deserve it … The pigs have come home to wallow in the mud of the Washington swamp, and we have a group of professional political punks—master scam artists—who are all too happy to shovel more slop while advocating that the producers should be punished further by raising their taxes and restricting entrepreneurs with business-wrecking overregulation … I’m not nearly as surprised with the outcome of the presidential election as I’m disheartened and disgusted that my fellow Americans can be this woefully uninformed, easily manipulated and thunderously ignorant.  I’ve got a rotting fence post smarter than these mouth breathers.  If you voted for [President Barack] Obama, you are thunderously dumb and incredibly naïve … Thanks for nothing, numbskulls</a>.” </p></div><p class="state_text tRight"><strong><em>2013-07-18</em></strong></p><hr/></li>

Roosevelt’s New Deal was responsible for creating the Social Security Administration, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Federal Housing Administration, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.  President Lyndon Johnson’s Great Society was responsible for the creation of Medicare and Medicaid, and a variety of other anti-poverty programs.  These programs <a href="http://mediamatters.org/blog/2010/10/26/becks-war-on-facts/172462" target="blank">drastically reduced the rate of poverty</a> nationally.  Nugent also spoke about his hometown of Detroit, Michigan, stating, “<a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2012/oct/30/ted-nugent-5-questions-with-decker/" target="blank">It is so very true that my birth city of Detroit was the cleanest, most neighborly, positive-energy, work-ethic epicenter of planet earth when I was born there in 1948, right on through to the 1960s. Enter the liberal death wish of Mayor Coleman Young and a tsunami of negative, anti-productivity policies by liberal Democrats that put a voodoo curse on our beloved Motor City. When you train and reward people to scam, cheat and refuse to be productive, there is only one direction that society can go: straight down the toilet.  It is truly a heartbreaker.  Some wonderful people are still to be found back home, but they are outnumbered by the pimps, whores and welfare brats that have made bloodsucking a lifestyle.  And now we have a president who is doing everything he can to take the whole country down that same path. Truly amazing</a>.” </p></div><p class="state_text tRight"><strong><em>2013-07-18</em></strong></p><hr/></li>

God help America</a>.”  Saul Alinsky was a community organizer and writer in the mid-20th century.  In 1971, he wrote a book called “Rules for Radicals” which described his theory and methods of organizing.  Richard Cloward and Frances Piven were sociologists and political activists. They outlined a political strategy in 1966 that called for overloading the U.S. public welfare system in order to precipitate a crisis that would lead to a replacement of the welfare system with a national system of "guaranteed annual income and thus an end to poverty."  President Barack Obama has never publicly mentioned Saul Alinsky, Richard Cloward or Frances Piven nor, has he supported a guaranteed annual income in place of welfare. </p></div><p class="state_text tRight"><strong><em>2013-07-18</em></strong></p><hr/></li>

The slaughter rages on in gun-free zones around the world.  Shame.  Here’s a lifesaving alert to the dependent masses: Unarmed and helpless is unarmed and helpless.  The evil guys running amok here, there and everywhere appreciate you very much, for they are assured in your gun-free zones that you are incapable of doing a darned thing when they decide to eat you alive, beat you to death, rape, rob, assault, torture and do with you as they wish, for you, my poor pathetic sheep, have chosen to be unarmed and helpless.  To bow before evil is as soulless as soulless gets.  No thank you. Those of us who dearly appreciate the precious gift of life follow our powerful instincts for self-preservation and have made it a priority to be ready to defend ourselves. Those on the lunatic fringe can squawk and moan all they want; the rest of us need no interpretation of ‘keep and bear.’  ‘Keep’ means it’s mine, and you can’t have it, and ‘bear’ means one thing and one thing only:  I have one or two on me, and they’re loaded.

Nugent was referring to several U.S. Fish and Wildlife Department raids on the guitar maker Gibson for importing endangered wood.

Jacking the poor and downtrodden against wealthy Americans is a core Democratic political strategy … The message the Democrats send to their base is that wealthy Americans are to be despised, maligned and punished.  The Democratic Party will never admit that wealthy Americans might just be smarter, have a greater tolerance for risk and a stronger work ethic than supporters who carp about how the system is rigged against them and seek a fantasy of ‘shared opportunity.’  Show me where life is fair and I will vote for President Obama.

Barack Obama hates freedom.  Barack Obama's voting record, his upbringing, his education, his words, his actions, his misdeeds, all reek of everything anti-American, anti-Constitution, anti-Bill of Rights.  The latter of which is most deviously manifested in his voting record against the individual right to keep and bear arms … America faces doom if we re-elect Barack Obama to the presidency.  It is a dire, dangerous forecast for freedom … If he wins in November he won't have to kowtow, he won't have to placate anybody anymore.  He will be able to go for the jugular, and that includes the jugular of the Second Amendment.  He will begin again what he did in Illinois as a gangster politician and go against gun rights, he will tax ammunition, he will ban certain types of bullets, and he will ban certain types of firearms.  His goal is Attorney General Eric Holder's goal: namely, to brainwash Americans into believing that guns are bad and that the Second Amendment does not mean individuals have the right to keep and bear arms.  Barack Obama is a smoke-and-mirrors scam artist who has convinced people he believes one and one equals two, while he shoves three-and-a-half down your throat … In November 2012, we are voting for [Republican presidential candidate Mitt] Romney/[Republican vice presidential candidate Paul]Ryan because we are voting for the very soul of America.

They are saturated in the media and entertainment, or by the entertainment industry, with violence.  And I think too many of our young people, in particular our young men, are fascinated with violence, and in particular fascinated with guns.  What we need to do is change the way in which people think about guns, especially young people, and make it something that’s not cool, that it’s not acceptable, it’s not hip to carry a gun anymore, in the way in which we changed our attitudes about cigarettes.  When I was growing up, people smoked all the time…but over time we changed the way people thought about smoking…and that’s what I think we need to do with guns, really change the way people think about them … This is not going to be something that’s very easy to do, because we are, quite frankly, fighting something that appears every day on television, on the radio, in our popular music, in movies that these kids are exposed to … We need to get really innovative, really creative things that are gonna grab the attention of these kids and change, as I said, the way in which they think about guns … I have asked the school board to make a part of every day some kind of anti-violence, anti-gun message.  Every day, every school, at every level.  One thing I think is clear with young people, and adults as well, is that we just have to be repetitive about this … We need to do this every day of the week and just really brainwash people into thinking about guns in a vastly different way</a>.” </p></div><p class="state_text tRight"><strong><em>2013-07-18</em></strong></p><hr/></li>

<li class="inner_topic clearfix"><div class="categories" title=""><strong></strong></div><div class="state_text"><p>In an October 1, 2012 radio interview on KMOX, a St. Louis news radio station, Nugent spoke about the November 2012 presidential campaign, stating, “<a href="http://stlouis.cbslocal.com/2012/10/01/mark-reardon-ted-nugent-st-louis-police-chief-dan-isom-actor-ben-stein/" target="blank">[Republican vice presidential candidate] Paul [Ryan] is a great man … He is really a keeper.  He’s one of the best of the best and I really believe that what [Republican presidential candidate] Mitt Romney has learned over the years really makes him better than just a good man, he’s now a great man.  He would be such a vast improvement over this current criminal administration and the policies that clearly are against the American way and against being the best that you can be.  So, Mitt Romney picked the right guy.  Paul Ryan’s a real blood-brother, man … Bow-hunting really is the most difficult thing in the world, as far as a self-imposed challenge goes … There’s a real higher level of awareness that one attains, that one has to aspire to and Paul Ryan has achieved that.  He’s a dedicated, very successful bow-hunter.  And that higher level of awareness that drives your higher level of awareness on every level of life is what has made [Paul Ryan] a great representative, a great U.S. Constitution, Bill of Rights representative of ‘We the People’ of Wisconsin. So, what he can do in America, I think we have seen with [Wisconsin Governor] Scott Walker, Tommy Thompson, the past governor and hopefully U.S. Senate from Wisconsin and with Paul Ryan as Congressman.  I mean, Wisconsin went from a suburb of the hash-bash hippie hell of Madison to being a really accountable, living within their means, balancing their budget, and getting rid of the fat and the waste in Wisconsin</a>.”  Governor Scott <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/rickungar/2012/02/14/will-gov-scott-walker-ever-come-clean-on-wisconsins-budget-deficit/" target="blank">Walker did not balance Wisconsin’s budget</a>. In a letter sent by Mike Huebsch, Walker’s Administration Secretary, to the U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services in December 2011, Huebsch stated that Wisconsin would have an “undisclosed deficit” from January, 2012 through June, 2013. Nugent then explained why he thought polls showed some swing states leaning towards President Barack Obama in the election, stating, “<a href="http://stlouis.cbslocal.com/2012/10/01/mark-reardon-ted-nugent-st-louis-police-chief-dan-isom-actor-ben-stein/" target="blank">When you buy votes, when you buy entire societal blocks with handouts and with promises that clearly can’t be kept.  But this president, President Obama and his gang, they have literally smoke and mirrored their way into this artificial reign of terror. Unfortunately, the terror isn’t artificial.  And so the people that support Barack Obama and this current corruption, the current abuse in the U.S. government, it’s because they’re getting something out of it</a>.” Nugent told the radio host, Mark Reardon, “<a href="http://stlouis.cbslocal.com/2012/10/01/mark-reardon-ted-nugent-st-louis-police-chief-dan-isom-actor-ben-stein/" target="blank">There’s a bunch of us, like you and me and people that work really hard and get up early and put their heart and soul into being the most productive asset they can to their fellow man …  Barack Obama’s voter block, either you’re a liability or you believe people can intentionally put themselves in the position of a liability.  So, that’s why Mitt Romney’s 47 percent statement is statistically irrefutable</a>.”  Nugent referred to controversial comments Mitt Romney made at a private fundraiser earlier this year.  Romney stated, “<a href="http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/09/secret-video-romney-private-fundraiser" target="blank">There are 47 percent of the people who will vote for the president no matter what.  All right, there are 47 percent who are with him, who are dependent upon government, who believe that they are victims, who believe the government has a responsibility to care for them, who believe that they are entitled to health care, to food, to housing, to you-name-it—that that's an entitlement.  And the government should give it to them.  And they will vote for this president no matter what. ... These are people who pay no income tax. ... [M]y job is not to worry about those people.  I'll never convince them they should take personal responsibility and care for their lives</a>." Nugent continued, stating, “<a href="http://stlouis.cbslocal.com/2012/10/01/mark-reardon-ted-nugent-st-louis-police-chief-dan-isom-actor-ben-stein/" target="blank">This President [Barack Obama] has bought the gay vote, overall, just basically speaking, obviously there’s a bunch of smart gay people out there that ain’t buyin’ this crap. He’s bought the black vote, event though there’s a bunch of really smart, independent, rugged individuals in the black community.  And the female vote with this lie that we’re somehow gonna take away their health care because we won’t buy them contraception.  I mean, every aspect of Barack Obama’s campaign would be laughable if it was just a movie</a>.”  Nugent was referring to a <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/health/diseasesconditionsandhealthtopics/health_insurance_and_managed_care/health_care_reform/contraception/index.html" target="blank">January 2012 Obama Administration announcement</a> that the “Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act” requires employers to provide health insurance which covers contraception for women free of charge.  </p></div><p class="state_text tRight"><strong><em>2013-07-18</em></strong></p><hr/></li>

Facts are facts … As I’ve written before, for at least the past 50 years the Democratic Party has intentionally engineered a class of political ‘victims’ who have been bamboozled into being dependent on the federal government for their subsistence, including food, housing and now health care.  They get this without paying any federal income taxes, and that’s wrong.  Something for nothing is always a scam.  This is how you buy votes, plain and simple … Alternatively, the majority of federal income taxes are paid by the top wage earners, the very group of individuals the Democrats and President Obama constantly demonize and want to punish by raising their taxes even higher.  This is what’s called ‘fair’ in this bizzarro world.  Those who pay nothing can continue to pay nothing, and those who pay all will pay more … The Democratic Party exists because it promotes the creation of dependence on Fedzilla.  They have intentionally created the real political victims, many of whom have been victimized by the Democrats for decades … Through the creation of the Nanny State, the Democrats have destroyed lives, families and entire communities, and convinced some Americans that they can’t achieve anything without Fedzilla’s help. They have their own soulless Declaration of Dependence.  That’s downright pathetic.  While creating this voting bloc of handcrafted victims, the Democrats have also waged an artful campaign to paint Republicans as a group of arrogant, greedy rich people.  Some Democrats like Vice President Joseph R. Biden take their venom-filled lies about the GOP even a step lower … He’s a race-baiting yarn-spinner.  He should be made to wear a dunce hat and stand in the corner for the remainder of the campaign … No able-bodied American should get anything for free while doing nothing to earn it.  Put a rake, shovel, paint brush or broom in their hands.  That will instill some pride back in their lives that the Democrats have worked double-time to make extinct … What Fedzilla has done to individuals and businesses is not a victimless crime.  It’s killing America</a>.”  Nugent was referring to controversial comments Mitt Romney made at a private fundraiser in May 2012.

Gabrielle Giffords was holding a ‘meet and greet’ with constituents was an unfathomable act of barbarism … The obviously guilty mass murderer has pleaded guilty and has been spared the death penalty.  Yet the death penalty is exactly what he deserves.  For his crimes, he will spend the rest of his life in prison while six innocent Americans are dead and 13 more are struggling to recover from their wounds.  Sparing the killer’s life is not justice, it’s legalized barbarism.  Allowing him to live out his days in prison is our convoluted legal system allowing Lady Justice to be mugged again and again … If a killer is deemed to be psychotic, he is held to a different standard by our legal system than a killer who is deemed not to be crazy.  That’s a legal system that is certifiably nuts … Locking up the terminal whack-job shooters in prison for the remainder of their lives will cost taxpayers many millions of wasted dollars when all that is required is a 25-cent bullet to the back of their deranged heads.  But the do-gooders among us say we shouldn’t do that, that the state shouldn’t sanction ‘murder,’ especially of those who are deemed to be mentally incompetent.  Do-gooders are more dangerous than a sow grizzly with cubs or a coiled rattlesnake, as do-gooders champion and sanction legalized barbarism … The McNaughton rule, which basically states that terminal whack jobs can’t be held responsible for their crimes, is the ultimate definition of nuts.  It should be replaced with the McNugent rule, which states that regardless of your mental state, if you slaughter innocent people, expect a bullet to the back of the head, most preferably at the scene of the crime.  So long as the American justice system is held hostage by mindless do-gooders who wish to enforce their toxic, brain-dead legalized barbarism on the rest of us, our only recourse is to be vigilant and ready to protect ourselves and our loved ones from these psychotic monsters.  Shoot them.  Punks deserve to pay for their crimes with their lives instead of living out their lives and attending group therapy sessions on the taxpayers’ dime and further burdening the society they already have hurt deeply</a>.” The McNaughton Rule, which Nugent refers to, is a legal standard for insanity.  Under the rule, there is a presumption of sanity.  The defense must prove "<a href="http://www.forensic-psych.com/articles/artMcNaughtonRule.php" target="blank">at the time of committing the act, the accused was laboring under such a defect of reason, from disease of the mind, as not to know the nature and quality of the act he was doing or, if he did know it, that he did not know what he was doing was wrong</a>."  In addition, studies show that it is typically <a href="http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/costs-death-penalty" target="blank">less costly</a> to imprison an individual for life than to sentence him/her to death. </p></div><p class="state_text tRight"><strong><em>2013-07-18</em></strong></p><hr/></li>

Maybe cause they don’t like you.  Maybe you’re the wrong color.  Maybe they don’t agree with your politics.  Maybe they don’t like your music.  It doesn’t matter the reason.  A law enforcement official of Game Departments of the United States of America do not respect and are not limited by the Fourth Amendment … They don’t need just cause.  They don’t need a search warrant.  They can cut the lock on your gate–while you’re home or you’re not home.  They can break into your freezer and examine the meat and see if it’s legal.  On a hunch.  On a rumor.  Or just on a bad day … So that’s offensive on all levels but there’s also some other jack-booted Gestapo maneuvers going on these days like the Gibson raids … While we’re sitting here, my email’s going [noise] blowing up with stories of heartbreak: where a teenager, who’s never broke the law in his life, who’s never been in trouble with the law in his life, his family [is] law-abiding, their family has been bankrupted because the U.S. Fish and Wildlife thugs, the same ones that raided Gibson … Just the examples would gag you … When Governor [and Republican presidential nominee Mitt] Romney becomes Commander-in-Chief, I pray to God, along with a great Vice President, Paul Ryan … have got to look into these violations of civil rights and basic human rights at the hands of agencies gone mad … Vote Romney and Paul Ryan as president</a>.”  The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service <a href="http://www.fws.gov/policy/445fw1.html#sect6" target="blank">is subject to the requirements of the Fourth Amendment</a>; however, some statutes give U.S. Fish and Wildlife agents authority to conduct warrantless searches.  Nugent was referring to several U.S. Fish and Wildlife Department raids on the guitar maker Gibson for importing endangered wood.</p>
<p>Turning to the topic of sexual assault of minors, Nugent stated, “<a href="http://noisyroom.net/blog/2012/09/01/ted-nugent-warns-feds-arresting-innocent-citizens-without-warrants/" target="blank">We’ve got to create community review boards for judges who keep letting child rapists out, when that judge knows if that child rapist is let out on the streets, he will rape again.  And our court systems answer to that is to register them?  To know where they live?  In a neighborhood instead of a cage, instead of jail</a>?” In 1978, Nugent began a relationship with <a href="http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2012/04/19/ted-nugent-american-traitor-misogynist-romney-surrogate/" target="blank">seventeen-year-old</a> Hawaii native Pele Massa. Due to the age difference they could not marry so Nugent joined Massa’s parents in signing documents to make himself her legal guardian. In 1998 interview with VH1, Nugent spoke about his “weakness for young women.”</p>
<p>In part two of the interview with <i>Patriot Update</i>, Nugent stated, “<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIyyxZN5f1w&amp;feature=youtu.be" target="blank">I hold the most important office on earth, ‘We the People.’  I am a we the people activist on behalf of my family, my neighborhood, my state, my country, and mostly that soldier in a box who died fighting for the U.S. Constitution.

Nugent then spoke about Kasim Reed, the Mayor of Atlanta, stating, “<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIyyxZN5f1w&amp;feature=youtu.be" target="blank">Me and old Kasim go way back.  Kasim condemned me recently on one of the news shows … I love when the brown-shirts hate people saving Jews.  Anyhow, the idiots and the America-haters hate me.  That proves I’m doing God’s work because the devil is upset</a>.”  Regarding The Badger State, Nugent said, “<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIyyxZN5f1w&amp;feature=youtu.be" target="blank">Wisconsin is the guiding force and light for what America should be doing, between Scott Walker as Governor, Paul Ryan as Congressman, and now the Senator Tommy Thompson.  America should go the way of Wisconsin because Wisconsin turned into a lump of liberal snot hair, just embarrassing.  Everything was wrong with it and then come from the debris came Scott Walker</a>.” Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed, whom Nugent refers to, appeared on “Meet the Press” and was asked about a comment Vice President Joe Biden made to a crowd in Danville, Virginia.  Biden stated, “<a href="http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2012/08/vp-biden-says-republicans-are-going-to-put-yall-back-in-chains/" target="blank">Every Republican’s voted for [the House GOP budget].  Look at what they value and look at their budget and what they’re proposing.  Romney…said in the first hundred days he’s going to let the big banks once again write their own rules, ‘unchain Wall Street.’ They’re going to put y’all back in chains</a>.”  Reed replied, “<a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/48716359/ns/meet_the_press-transcripts/t/august-bob-mcdonnell-martin-omalley-ted-cruz-kasim-reed-ej-dionne-peggy-noonan-chuck-todd/#.UD4uy0QdI3Y" target="blank">When Mitt Romney or Paul Ryan stands up to Rush Limbaugh…when they’re disparaging a Georgetown law student or stands up to Ted Nugent, really stands up to anybody or stands up to Donald Trump, then I’ll be willing to have a conversation about a comment that the vice president made</a>.” </p></div><p class="state_text tRight"><strong><em>2013-07-18</em></strong></p><hr/></li>

We would be wise to remember when then-Sen. Barack Obama was campaigning for the presidency and told Joe the Plumber, “I think when you spread the wealth around, it’s good for everybody.” Those are the words of a socialist who learned his lessons well from his socialist upbringing and on the streets of Chicago as a community organizer … Socialists are punks who think they are smarter than ordinary Americans and that ordinary Americans are so dumb they need to be managed by Fedzillacrats in Washington.

Nugent wrote, “<a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2012/aug/24/class-warfare-is-all-democrats-have-left-romney-ta/" target="blank">As usual, the Democrats have nothing worthy of their own to promote, so they are going after Mitt Romney to release more of his tax records. My advice to Mr. Romney is to tell the Democrats to pound sand … What the Democrats want to do is to play class warfare, pit rich against poor. Playing class warfare is all the proof you need to know that the Democratic Party despises successful people such as Mr. Romney. The Democrats abhor success. They would rather Americans be beholden to Fedzilla for food stamps and other government programs than go out and become tremendously successful on their own. The Democrats hate success because they know success ultimately breeds success. The more successful Americans are, the less power and influence the Democrats can have over them, which means the less political power the Democrats can wield. That’s not a good thing for socialists and other big-government addicts and dependents. The “man” keeping down the people is not a successful person such as Mr. Romney, but rather the Democratic Party, which buys their votes by enslaving its supporters with government programs and checks, funded with the tax dollars that people like Mr. Romney have paid … With the sizable and legal pile of money Mr. Romney is reported to have made and banked, my hope is that he has legally hid as much of it as possible from Fedzilla. I would much rather Mr. Romney have his money than surrender it to Uncle Sham, who burns through our hard-earned tax dollars with impunity … Should Mr. Romney release his records, let’s wait and see if [President Barack Obama] then releases all his academic records, complete health records and other documents. How about it, Mr. President</a>?” </p></div><p class="state_text tRight"><strong><em>2013-07-18</em></strong></p><hr/></li>

Nugent commented, “<a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2012/aug/2/nut-control-not-gun-control-failure-to-deal-with-m/?page=1" target="blank">According to the kind, caring and considerate left, you have every right to be a crazy druggie and roam the streets with no means of support.  Heck, they even help nut-jobs occupy Wall Street and beyond.  Surely, the unarmed and helpless will someday bring peace to the world, end world hunger and Rodney King’s dream of everyone getting along will become a reality.  No wonder they call it dope.  Years ago the left clamored that mental institutions violated the rights of those with mental illnesses.  The American Civil Liberties Union even sued on their behalf.  The result was the doors of the cuckoo nests were flung open and the patients stumbled out.  Now they are everywhere.  You can’t visit any city in America without encountering dirty people who are severely mentally impaired roaming the streets.  Pushing shopping carts, mumbling to themselves, sleeping under bridges or in parks and basically being a nuisance, they ultimately endanger themselves.  Most are not violent, just certifiably crazy by anyone’s standards.  The real discussion that needs to occur in America is how we finally throw off the shackles of political correctness, quit worrying about ‘feelings’ and simply restrict the rights of psychotics by making it easier to lock them up for their safety and the safety of others.  Advocating additional gun laws and gun-free zones is crazy.  Crazy talk like that can get you killed</a>.” Rodney King was an African-American construction worker who was beaten by Los Angeles police officers during a traffic stop in 1991.  Four police officers from the LAPD who took part in the incident were later tried.  Three of them were acquitted, and the jury failed to reach a verdict regarding the fourth.  The acquittals are generally considered to have triggered the 1992 Los Angeles riots, in which 53 people were killed, and over 2,000 injured. During the riots, King appeared on television and asked, "Can we all get along?"</p></div><p class="state_text tRight"><strong><em>2013-07-18</em></strong></p><hr/></li>

Instead of tightening Fedzilla’s fiscal belt, government bureaucrats just buy him bigger belts and suspenders, and he gets fatter and smellier each day.  The only good pig is a dead pig.  Regrettably, there are way too many intellectually stunted Americans who support this gluttonous and irresponsible spending curse.  They are called socialists.  Socialists believe in Keynesian economics, which supports government control and meddling in our economy … It’s akin to Jerry Sandusky managing a little boys’ football team. Another, more accurate name for Keynesian economics is Kamikaze economics</a>.”  Keynesian economics are based on the ideas of 20th century economist John Maynard Keynes.  Advocates of Keynesian economics argue that private sector decisions sometimes lead to inefficient macroeconomic outcomes which require active policy responses by the public sector.  Nugent also made reference to Jerry Sandusky, a former assistant football coach at Penn State University who was convicted of sexually abusing ten boys during a 15-year period.  Finally, Nugent described fellow <a href="http://meetthenra.org/nra-member/Grover Norquist" target="blank">NRA board member Grover Norquist</a> as “The Dirty Harry of tax and government reform.”  “<a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2012/jul/26/grover-norquist-beltways-clint-eastwood/" target="blank">Dirty Harry Norquist, president of Americans For Tax Reform, has never seen a tax increase he supports</a>,” wrote Nugent, “<a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2012/jul/26/grover-norquist-beltways-clint-eastwood/" target="blank">which should immediately put him at the head of the line for a Presidential Medal of Freedom once Mitt Romney is elected.

<li class="inner_topic clearfix"><div class="categories" title=""><strong></strong></div><div class="state_text"><p>In a July 26, 2012 interview with conservative radio host Glenn Beck, Nugent spoke about a mass shooting that had occurred at a movie theater in Aurora, Colorado six days earlier.  In that shooting, severely mentally ill gunman James Holmes killed 12 people and wounded 58 others.  Holmes wore full body armor during the attack.  Nugent commented to Beck, “<a href="http://mediamatters.org/blog/2012/07/26/nugent-doubles-down-claims-aurora-shooter-could/187343" target="blank">And remember, Glenn, this monster in Aurora took 20 minutes to do his evil.  In 20 minutes you don't need an assault weapon, you don't need a machine gun, which he didn't have either of, but you could do more damage with a single shot or a bolt action because he had 20 minutes … His AR-15 Smith &amp; Wesson rifle is now the most popular sporting rifle in America.  It is the number one competition, number one in self-defense; it's the number one sporting rifle for big game and small game.  And if they keep calling it an ‘assault weapon,’ I may have that aneurysm</a>.”  In fact, the shooting in Aurora lasted only two minutes, after which time Holmes was apprehended by police in the parking lot of the theater.  Single shot rifles and bolt action rifles, which Nugent made reference to, must be reloaded manually after each shot is fired.  A semiautomatic firearm reloads automatically and can keep firing until its magazine is emptied.  Holmes had three semiautomatic firearms on the night of the Aurora shooting, including an AR-15 style rifle (the civilian version of the military’s M-16 rifle) equipped with a 100-round drum magazine.  Paul A. Smith, outdoors editor for the <i>Milwaukee Journal Sentinel</i>, has stated that while AR-15s "<a href="http://mediamatters.org/blog/2012/07/26/nugent-doubles-down-claims-aurora-shooter-could/187343" target="blank">have gained favor among some hunters and sport shooters in recent decades, they constitute a small fraction of deer hunting rifles in use today</a>." </p>
<p>Finally, Nugent compared target shooting to the scenario that an armed citizen might have encountered had he/she attempted to return fire against Holmes in the theater:  “<a href="http://mediamatters.org/blog/2012/07/26/nugent-doubles-down-claims-aurora-shooter-could/187343" target="blank">I know the hysteria about tear gas and it was dark in the theater.  Glenn, I am not making this up.  Last week my wife Shemane and I were filming a segment for our Spirit of the Wild show and we were shooting at watermelons surrounded by human silhouette targets just as kind of a competition and from 20 feet and from 20 yards and we were shooting from every imaginable angle, under cover, from sitting, from squatting, from prone position, from behind cover and from in the open, and we never hit an innocent and we never missed the watermelon.  And I'm just a guitar player.  If a guitar player can neutralize a watermelon from 20 feet—and this is with live fire, by the way.  We would shoot while the other would take the target shots.  So there was that tension of live fire.  And this was done in a scenario—and I understand it wasn't real bullets coming at us and it wasn't people screaming, running around … But dear God in heaven, doing nothing is not an option.  Training, having a firearm to neutralize an evil gun maniac is a way to go, and we train for that.  And I wish I would have been in the theater that day</a>.” </p></div><p class="state_text tRight"><strong><em>2013-07-18</em></strong></p><hr/></li>

Cosby said that the race of Trayvon Martin was less important than the fact that the neighborhood watch volunteer who killed him was carrying a gun.  In Cosby’s words:  “<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfOf0sNSR4c" target="blank">When a person has a gun, sometimes their mind clicks that this thing...will win arguments and straighten people out</a>.”  Nugent wrote, “<a href="http://www.newsmax.com/TedNugent/Bill-Cosby-Trayvon-Zimmerman/2012/06/15/id/442488" target="blank">Maybe that logic applies to drunks, dope heads and recidivistic gang bangers, but it doesn’t apply to the hundreds of thousands of law-abiding Americans with concealed carry permits such as George Zimmerman … Americans with concealed carry permits are tremendously responsible citizens, maybe the most responsible citizens of all</a>.” In reality, at least <a href="http://www.vpc.org/ccwkillers.htm" target="blank">447 Americans</a> were killed by concealed carry permit holders between May 2007 and June 2012. Nugent continued, stating, “<a href="http://www.newsmax.com/TedNugent/Bill-Cosby-Trayvon-Zimmerman/2012/06/15/id/442488" target="blank">Advocating that only the police should be armed in public is advocating a senseless and wrong-headed policy of the slaughter of innocent Americans.  Mr. Cosby is dead wrong here.  His unarmed son was murdered for God's sake</a>.”  Bill Cosby’s only son, Ennis, was shot and killed during a mugging along an interstate in Los Angeles while changing a tire in January 1997.  Turning to the issue of race, Nugent wrote, “<a href="http://www.newsmax.com/TedNugent/Bill-Cosby-Trayvon-Zimmerman/2012/06/15/id/442488" target="blank">I do agree with Mr. Cosby that the Trayvon Martin shooting has nothing to do with race.  Only empty-headed racists such as our black-panther loving Department of Justice believe otherwise.  Race does, however, play a significant role in the percentage of black Americans who are killed and wounded every single day in America. The overwhelming majority of blacks are slaughtered by other black hoodlums, the overwhelming majority of whom are involved in gangs and drugs—you know, that ‘victimless crime’ thing</a>.” </p></div><p class="state_text tRight"><strong><em>2013-07-18</em></strong></p><hr/></li>

He stated, “<a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2012/jun/13/attracting-the-latino-vote/" target="blank">The key to attracting Latino voters is to appeal to their sense of independence and to inform them the GOP believes in the power of the individual, not Fedzilla whose track record is one of dependence and destruction</a>.”  Nugent continued, stating, “<a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2012/jun/13/attracting-the-latino-vote/" target="blank">Mr. Romney should continue to press for education reform, and remind Latino voters that education is vital to success.  He should illustrate the importance that Americans of Asia-Pacific descent place on education and how fast their children move into the middle class.  It doesn’t have to be an Asian thing … Mr. Romney should also hammer away at the welfare state that Democrats have largely created and continue to support.

<li class="inner_topic clearfix"><div class="categories" title=""><strong></strong></div><div class="state_text"><p>On April 5, 2012, Nugent conducted a wide-ranging interview on KFYI’s “Mike Broomhead Show.”  He made the following comments:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nugent was first asked to respond to a Department of Justice investigation into allegedly unconstitutional and discriminatory practices employed by anti-immigrant hardliner and Maricopa County, Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio.  “<a href="http://www.kfyi.com/player/?mid=21974170" target="_blank">Well it’s an ongoing manifestation of a government out of control.  And there is no better warrior, there is no better American hero, to stand up against Fedzilla than the greatest sheriff in the world, Sherriff Joe Arpaio.  I would like to take this opportunity if I might, Mike, because you’re bringing up an important global story that’s coming right out of Phoenix.  So I want to establish my absolute heart and soul support for Sherriff Joe and all the heroes of the Maricopa County Sherriff Department</a>.”</li>
<li>Nugent then turned to his appearance the previous night on CNN’s “Piers Morgan Tonight,” where he discussed the killing of unarmed 17-year-old Trayvon Martin by neighborhood watch “captain” George Zimmerman in Sanford, Florida, stating, “<a href="http://www.kfyi.com/player/?mid=21974170" target="_blank">[Piers Morgan] attempted to get me on the gun issue but I let him have it.  I kept it civil and I let him know that the Trayvon Martin/George Zimmerman situation is anything but what most of the media was attempting to depict it as.  We should be ashamed of ourselves that our media in the United States of America is convicting this man.  Convicting him of quote ‘cold-blooded murder’ when the facts are still not in</a>.”  He went on to <a href="http://www.lonang.com/exlibris/blackstone/bla-416.htm" target="_blank">falsely characterize</a> English Common Law, saying, “<a href="http://www.kfyi.com/player/?mid=21974170" target="_blank">Piers Morgan tried to relate the English law would have not stood for George Zimmerman defending himself.  And I had to clarify to the CNN viewing public that in England, by law, if someone breaks into your house, you have to retreat like a cowardly sheep out the back door, Mike.  People listening right now to you and I on KYFI might not believe this, but in England if someone breaks into your house you have a lawful duty to get out of it.  To escape.  To not defend yourself.  To not defend your home.  That’s anti- human, its absolutely repulsive, and it encourages crime</a>.”  Nugent was then asked to address the racial implications of the Trayvon Martin incident (Martin is African-American while Zimmerman is Caucasian/Hispanic) leading him to respond, “<a href="http://www.kfyi.com/player/?mid=21974170" target="_blank">[Piers Morgan] is convinced that the vast majority of Americans want this guy [George Zimmerman] arrested and convicted.  And I cleared him up on my intro.  I said Piers, ‘The vast majority of Americans do not want this guy arrested and convicted.  The vast majority of Americans are like the Nugent family.  Were not only praying for Trayvon Martin’s family and George Zimmerman’s family, but were still busy praying for the families of the ten black children slaughtered in Chicago on the same weekend that Trayvon Martin was killed.’  Forty-nine shootings in Chicago that weekend.  Ten dead.  But according to Jesse Jackson and Al ‘Not So’ Sharpton and all these left-wing Marxist media pundits, that all those dead black kids don’t matter because they were killed by black people.  The only black life that matters to Al Sharpton is when a black person is killed by maybe, not a Hispanic, but a white Hispanic … Nobody cares about race.  There’s only a handful of nutcases like Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson that care about race.  The rest of us value human life regardless of the color</a>.”  In a March 24-25, 2012 CNN poll, <a href="http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0312/74486.html" target="_blank">73% of Americans</a> said that George Zimmerman should be arrested.  </li>

I also do not want to try this on television.  I think we both agree that there is a tragedy that it is being tried and that Zimmerman has been convicted across the media in many instances.  So let’s not do this here.  So let me propose to you a scenario that I think you can grasp and support.  You must be aware, and if not ill inform you now, how many professional law enforcement heroes are killed every year with their own weapon.  I’m not juxtaposing this with the Trayvon and the Zimmerman situation, but it does happen where an assaultant will start beating a person so badly that those of us that are armed, we have a responsibility to keep that new assault from taking our weapon.  Because if the assault escalates to that degree, certainly the fist can go into a deadly situation if they get ahold of the gun bearer’s gun.  So we have to be cognizant of that.  If it wasn’t for backup guns in law enforcement and in civilian hands oftentimes, that the perpetrator and the person getting beat up is killed with his own gun.  So let’s not dismiss that reality that is documented over and over again across this country</a>,” stated Nugent.  Morgan then asked him, “<a href="http://piersmorgan.blogs.cnn.com/2012/04/05/clips-from-last-night-ted-nugent-on-trayvon-martin-stedman-graham-on-identity-and-ownership/" target="_blank">Do you believe that a neighborhood watch official acting in that capacity should be armed and using that firearm?</a>” to which he responded, “<a href="http://piersmorgan.blogs.cnn.com/2012/04/05/clips-from-last-night-ted-nugent-on-trayvon-martin-stedman-graham-on-identity-and-ownership/" target="_blank">Yes</a>.”  In a March 24-25, 2012 CNN poll, <a href="http://articles.cnn.com/2012-03-26/justice/justice_florida-teen-shooting-poll_1_gun-laws-shooting-death-grand-jury?_s=PM:JUSTICE" target="_blank">three-quarters of Americans</a> said that neighborhood watch volunteers should not be armed.  </p></div><p class="state_text tRight"><strong><em>2013-07-18</em></strong></p><hr/></li>

<li class="inner_topic clearfix"><div class="categories" title=""><strong></strong></div><div class="state_text"><p>On February 27, 2012, Nugent conducted a wide-ranging interview on KFYI’s “Mike Broomhead Show.”  He made the following comments:</p>
<ul>
<li>Commenting on the position of the administration of President Barack Obama that the wealthy should pay more taxes, Nugent stated, “<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-ETxVyHZuQ" target="_blank">Let’s call a spade a spade.  I mean the entire current administration under the America-hating Barack Obama, and the America-hating Joe Biden, and the American Constitution criminal Eric Holder.  Tim Geithner is the perfect example of what the current American government stinks like.  Because Tim Geithner is a tax thief.  Tim Geithner was caught not paying his taxes.  So instead of being in jail, Tim Geithner, the tax thief, is actually in charge of our financial system.  Are you kidding me, why don’t we just hire [serial killer] Jeffery Dahmer to be in charge of the children’s playground?  I mean this whole administration is so corrupt.  It abuses power like no one in the history of the United States of America has ever done.  And Tim Geithner is a poster child.  Just like Eric Holder.  Running guns to the Mexican drug kings.  Are you kidding me?  Could it get crazier?  Could it get more criminal than this?  We have criminals.  We have American-hating maniacs in our government.  And Tim Geithner’s latest nonsense is a perfect example of that</a>.”  At one point, while pronouncing U.S. Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner’s last name, Nugent appeared to call him a “kike.”</li>
<li>Commenting on 2012 Republican presidential candidates Mitt Romney, Rick Santorum, Newt Gingrich, and Ron Paul, he stated, “<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-ETxVyHZuQ" target="_blank">I have great admiration, in varying degrees, for each and every one of them.  Each and every one of these candidates have some really really quality positive points about them.  And each one of them would make a vastly superior president of the United States than the current mess that we’re in right now.  That should be perfectly clear to anybody with a brain.  But ultimately these guys got to go down to the Army-Navy surplus store and buy themselves a box of scrotums.  They’ve gotta get some balls … These four presidential candidates have to get a little tougher, a little bit more fist pounding on the bully pulpit, and identify the curse, the abject curse that is the United States government the way it stands right now in the hands of Barack Hussein Obama and Eric Holder, et al</a>.” </li>
<li>Continuing on the topic of the Obama administration, Nugent stated, “<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-ETxVyHZuQ" target="_blank">Speaking of ridiculous policies, anti-American policies, this current anti-American monster in the White House, this administration is blatant and flagrantly abusing the Constitution, violating the Constitution, and continuing on a death march for America</a>.” </li>
<li>Turning to the topic of entitlement programs, Nugent claimed, “<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-ETxVyHZuQ" target="_blank">The entire welfare program is slavery.  We are literally enslaving people to feed off of a government and rewarding people to be the worst that they can be, to not try something.  Get rid of this embarrassment that there is a list of jobs that Americans aren’t willing to do.  Are you kidding me?  How about the condition where Americans have actually given up looking for work.  That is so embarrassing, why don’t these people just move to France</a>.”  </li>

This is so very wrong.  We should respect a person’s financial privacy and celebrate any American who succeeds … There is this toxic, anti-American idea that has surfaced that financial success is something that should be questioned, maligned and condemned and is somehow malicious.  This is dangerous and dumb.  The Occupy idiots who condemn and blame Wall Street for America’s stagnant economy are simpletons.  Let’s hope these morons just keep getting stoned and forget to vote in November</a>.”  The release of Romney’s tax returns led to the disclosure that he earns most of his multi-million dollar income in capital gains and placed millions of dollars in <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/romney-parks-millions-offshore-tax-haven/story?id=15378566&amp;singlePage=true#.T0PQNmB5lXV" target="_blank">offshore investments in an account located in the tax haven Cayman Islands</a>. </p></div><p class="state_text tRight"><strong><em>2013-07-18</em></strong></p><hr/></li>

If you listen carefully to these America-hating, social-engineering liberals, virtually all behavior, conduct, morals and beliefs make America stronger.  This, of course, is toxic, brain-dead logic that leaves ordinary Americans shaking and scratching their heads in confusion and disgust.  We recognize bull dung when we hear, see and smell it, and we have no desire whatsoever to embrace it … The left is forcing its version of diversity throughout our society and culture.  According to the left and its acolytes, we are supposed to respect people who refuse to respect Old Glory or learn English, look for a job or put forth the effort to do an honest day’s work.  We are supposed to respect all cultures, values, laws and religions—even when they have proved throughout history to be dangerous and diametrically opposed to our American way of life, customs, laws and traditions.  It will be a cold day in hell before I embrace voodoolike religions and unclean stone-age cultures that retard progress instead of advancing it.  The real issue is that by forcing diversity and multicultural nonsense in our workplaces, schools and government agencies on people who still cherish common sense and traditional American values, we’re ripping the nation apart</a>.”  Nugent went on to claim that Attorney General Eric Holder’s statement that some critics of President Obama are motivated by race is “the ultimate act of racism.”  He continued, “<a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2012/jan/9/diversity-perversity/" target="_blank">I respect diverse people who respect and cherish basic American customs, traditions, goodwill and values.  I have no respect for left-wingers who employ intimidation to make multiculturalism or diversity mandatory as the law of the land.  The diversity punks believe in racial set-asides and preferences.  You won’t ever solve discrimination by engaging in reverse discrimination. Maybe a racist like Jesse Jackson or Mr. Holder believes in reverse discrimination, but ordinary Americans do not.  We are much too focused and intelligent to buy into such Jabberwocky.  Real diversity, real change, real progress is accomplished by promoting and embracing Western culture, values and traditions, which is what made America great and created the greatest quality of life ever. Weakening this proven methodology under the artful guise of diversity, multiculturalism and political correctness is every bit as insidious a threat to America as are voodoo-inspired terrorist punks</a>.”</p></div><p class="state_text tRight"><strong><em>2013-07-18</em></strong></p><hr/></li>

That may be ugly and uncomfortable to the soulless, politically correct masters of denial, but it’s the truth nonetheless.  Being poor is largely a choice, a daily, if not hourly, decision … We need to punish poor decisions instead of rewarding them.  We cannot continue to offer a safety blanket to those Americans who make poor choices.  The fewer social welfare programs, the better.  This, too, may be ugly and uncomfortable, but we must make hard choices that force people into making smart, responsible decisions … Our schools need to be dramatically restructured.  I advocate that our kids go to school year-round from 8 a.m. until 5 p.m.  We need to make it easier to fire poor teachers and reward good ones and bust up the National Education Association [union] … If you can’t afford to have kids, quit having them and expecting the taxpayers to pay for them.  Men and women with no visible means of support other than the taxpayer dime shouldn’t be having children.  That may sound ugly and controlling, but it’s much uglier to expect the taxpayer to pay for mindless baby-making machines, which guarantees the cycle of poverty</a>.” </p></div><p class="state_text tRight"><strong><em>2013-07-18</em></strong></p><hr/></li>

I find that beautiful—priceless, actually.  Only human cockroaches spotlight themselves … What America is witnessing is the Democratic Party on parade.  I say let the parade of simple stooges continue.  Let them continue to demand something for nothing, try and close down streets, fight with the cops, live in filth, dance like Timothy Leary zombies.  It’s beautiful.  It’s so Democratic Party.  Let working hard, playing hard mom-and-pop America witness the Democratic Party in all its shameless, numskull and dirty glory.  As the party clowns work tirelessly to falsely paint conservatives as heartless, cold, evil, sexist and racist, I say conservatives should do whatever we can to encourage the Occupy stooges to stay on course, painting themselves for what they are.  While I don’t condone violence, watching the cops pounce on and pepper-spray a few Occupy stooges and then drag the dirtballs off to jail in shackles is good for my conservative soul and gold for my sense of humor.

I am convinced that the Republicans in general—and [2012 Republican presidential candidate] Rick Perry, specifically—represent that spirit and that spirit is alive and well across this country.  And if we just went to the core of those that are collecting unemployment checks that will look you right in the eye…and go, ‘Yeah, there’s a bunch of jobs I can take, but why bother?  I’m getting a pretty good check as it is and they’ll give it to me for two years.’  Do you realize that curse is widespread in this country?

The problem has gotten much worse after spending over $16 trillion since 1965 on so-called poverty programs</a>.” President Lyndon Johnson’s “Great Society” initiative was responsible for the creation of Medicare and Medicaid, and a variety of other anti-poverty programs. These programs, according to a 2012 study published by Brookings Institute, helped reduced the poverty by 26.4% from 1960 to 2000.</div><p class="state_text tRight"><strong><em>2004-08-24</em></strong></p><hr/></li>

Do you think I was gonna’ lay down my guitar and go play army?  Give me a break!  I was busy doin’ it to it … I got my physical notice thirty days prior to.  Well, on that day I ceased cleansing my body.  No more brushing my teeth, no more washing my hair, no baths, no soap, no water.  Thirty days of debris build.  I stopped shavin’ and I was 18, had a little scraggly beard, really looked like a hippie.  I had long hair, and it started gettin’ kinky, matted up.  Then two weeks before, I stopped eating any food with nutritional value … Then a week before, I stopped going to the bathroom.  I did it in my pants. poop, piss the whole shot.  My pants got crusted up.  See, I approached the whole thing like, Ted Nugent, cool hard-workin’ dude, is gonna wreak havoc on these imbeciles in the armed forces.  I’m gonna’ play their own game, and I’m gonna’ destroy ‘em.  Now my whole body is crusted in poop and piss.  I was ill.  And three or four days before, I started stayin’ awake.  I was close to death, but I was in control.  I was extremely anti-drug as I’ve always been, but I snorted some crystal methedrine.  Talk about one wounded mother *****.  A guy put up four lines, and it was for all four of us, but I didn’t know and I’m vacuuming that poop right up.  I was a walking, talking hunk of human poop.  I was six-foot-three of sin.  So the guys took me down to the physical, and my nerves, my emotions were distraught.  I was not a good person … So I went in, and those guys in uniform couldn’t believe the smell.  They were ridiculin’ me and pushin’ me around and I was cryin’, but all the time I was laughin’ to myself.  When they stuck the needle in my arm for the blood test I passed out, and when I came to they were kicking me into the wall.  Then they made everybody take off their pants, and I did, and this sergeant says, ‘Oh my God, put those back on!  You *****’ swine, you!’  Then they had a urine test and I couldn’t piss, but my poop was just like ooze, man, so I poop in the cup and put it on the counter.  I had poop on my hand and my arm.  The guy almost puked.  I was so proud. I knew I had these chumps beat.  The last thing I remember was wakin’ up in the ear test booth and they were sweepin’ up.  So I went home and cleaned up.  They took a putty knife to me.  I got the street rats out of my hair, ate some good steaks, beans, potatoes, cottage cheese, milk.  A couple of days and I was ready to kick ass.  And in the mail I got this big juicy 4-F.  They’d call dead people before they’d call my ass.  But you know the funny thing about it?  I’d make an incredible army man.  I’d be a colonel before you knew what hit you, and I’d have the baddest bunch of motherfuckin’ killers you’d ever seen in my platoon.  But I just wasn’t into it.

<li style="display: none;">We’re a little spoiled in Texas and Arizona and Wyoming and Vermont. Can you be spoiled in Vermont? And Kansas. We’re starting to get something that looks like the Second Amendment in some places, because it doesn’t exist anywhere yet.</li>
<li style="display: none;">That’s the Second Amendment. If you’re 18 and you’re not convicted of a felony or a violent crime you get to keep and you get to bear 24/7/365 anywhere you damn well please.</li>
<li style="display: none;">My name’s Ted Nugent. I’m 66 years old and I’ve never been in a gun-free zone.       Ever.</li>
<li style="display: none;">I cannot comprehend the soullessness of unarmed and helpless.</li>
<li style="display: none;">So the community scammer [President Barack Obama] didn’t get to be the Commander in Chief because he’s clever. [Democratic presidential candidate] Hillary Clinton, [National Security Advisor] Susan Rice and [IRS employee] Lois Lerner aren’t in jail yet because they’re sneaky. They commit their crimes in the wide open and We The People have failed to arrest them yet.</li>
<li style="display: none;">Whatever we want is always the right thing.</li>
<li style="display: none;">Here’s the only gun law we need: Don’t shoot the wrong guy.</li>
<li style="display: none;">Back when Richard Pryor’s afro caught on fire, I knew I was on the mountaintop of comedy … But thank God the liberal media has actually gotten funnier than Richard Pryor’s afro igniting.</li>
<li style="display: none;">Don’t back away from the storm. Look for the storm. Put your head down and walk proudly right into the storm. Let the wimps and the French back away. You just keep plowing forward, the higher the drifts, the worse the wind, the more wolves, kill ‘em all.</li>
<li style="display: none;">Go forth into that quiet night and let our government know we want separation of powers. Tell them to be the watchdogs our Founding Fathers wanted them to be, not to be a united force against the citizens. So take this good [guns] and use it against the bad and the ugly. It’s a target rich environment. If it was duck season, there’d be so many ducks, you could just close your eyes and shoot ‘em. Don’t close your eyes and don’t shoot just yet, but plow forward and demand accountability … So now let’s take all that good and crush the bad and the ugly, when we identify the gun-grabbers and freedom-haters.</li>
<li style="display: none;">If your child is dying, and there’s only one way to get to the doctor, would you get on [Senate Minority Leader] Harry Reid’s boat to get there? Then your child’s dead. I’d get on the boat, get there, and then I’d shoot him.</li>

Nugent wrote, “<a href="http://www.wnd.com/2013/07/what-would-martin-luther-king-jr-do/" target="blank">[A]ll thinking people are very relieved that George Zimmerman was found not guilty by the intelligent, justice-driven women of the jury, in spite of the façade presented by the prosecution and forced by the threat of racism by everyone from President Obama, to Eric Holder, the New Black Panther gangstas, NAACP, excuse-makers of every stripe and even the governor of Florida, but still this innocent man who simply defended his life from a violent, life-threatening, bloodying, head and face slamming attack by an enraged black man-child has so wrongly paid an inexplicable price financially and emotionally … George Zimmerman and his entire family, innocent of any wrongdoing, have lost everything and will be in debt for a long, long time for having to fight the trumped-up charges that he ‘profiled’ and/or set out to murder the poor, helpless, dope-smoking, dope-peddling, gangsta wannabe, Skittles hoodie boy <em class="blue">[1]</em></a>.” Zimmerman’s lawyers set up a website last summer titled “<a href="http://www.gzdefensefund.com/" target="blank">George Zimmerman Defense Fund <em class="blue">[2]</em></a>” to accept donations and raised almost $500,000 by the July 10 start of the trial.

He also suggested that America "<a href="http://www.wnd.com/2013/05/the-5-year-nuge-immigration-plan/" target="blank">apply Sherriff Joe Arpaio justice <em class="blue">[2]</em></a>" to anyone who has been deported for committing a crime and caught trying to re-enter the country.  According to Nugent, "<a href="http://www.wnd.com/2013/05/the-5-year-nuge-immigration-plan/" target="blank">The anchor baby scam should be immediately rescinded. You don't need to be a constitutional expert like our President to know that the original intent of the 14th Amendment was not to provide citizenship to illegal women or their babies who are born on American soil <em class="blue">[3]</em></a>." </p>
<p>The “Anchor Baby” narrative pushed by Nugent is largely a <a href="http://swampland.time.com/2010/08/11/dispelling-anchor-baby-myths/" target="blank">myth <em class="blue">[4]</em></a>.  Most families immigrate to the United States for simple economic reasons, not to have children. Sheriff Joe Arpaio is a sheriff working along the Arizona-Mexico border.  In 2011 a Justice Department <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/justice/2011/12/15/390264/despite-stonewalling-doj-uncovers-rampant-lawbreaking-by-sheriff-joe-arpaio/" target="blank">report <em class="blue">[5]</em></a> found that Arpaio had committed wide ranging civil rights violations and instituted racial profiling.  In May, 2013 a federal judge <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/25/us/federal-judge-finds-violations-of-rights-by-sheriff-joe-arpaio.html?_r=0" target="blank">ruled <em class="blue">[6]</em></a> that Arpaio had violated the rights of Latinos by targeting them during raids and police stops. </p>
<p>Nugent also derided government efforts to communicate through Spanish language documents saying, “<a href="http://www.wnd.com/2013/05/the-5-year-nuge-immigration-plan/" target="blank">The most racist thing our government does is to print literature in Spanish, thereby encouraging people not to learn English and deny themselves all the American Dream has to offer <em class="blue">[7]</em></a>.” </p></div><p class="fRight clearfix tRight">Sources <a href="http://www.wnd.com/2013/05/the-5-year-nuge-immigration-plan/" target="_blank">[1]</a> <a href="

Cosby said that the race of Trayvon Martin was less important than the fact that the neighborhood watch volunteer who killed him was carrying a gun.  In Cosby’s words:  “<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfOf0sNSR4c" target="blank">When a person has a gun, sometimes their mind clicks that this thing...will win arguments and straighten people out <em class="blue">[3]</em></a>.”  Nugent wrote, “<a href="http://www.newsmax.com/TedNugent/Bill-Cosby-Trayvon-Zimmerman/2012/06/15/id/442488" target="blank">Maybe that logic applies to drunks, dope heads and recidivistic gang bangers, but it doesn’t apply to the hundreds of thousands of law-abiding Americans with concealed carry permits such as George Zimmerman … Americans with concealed carry permits are tremendously responsible citizens, maybe the most responsible citizens of all <em class="blue">[4]</em></a>.” In reality, at least <a href="http://www.vpc.org/ccwkillers.htm" target="blank">447 Americans <em class="blue">[5]</em></a> were killed by concealed carry permit holders between May 2007 and June 2012. Nugent continued, stating, “<a href="http://www.newsmax.com/TedNugent/Bill-Cosby-Trayvon-Zimmerman/2012/06/15/id/442488" target="blank">Advocating that only the police should be armed in public is advocating a senseless and wrong-headed policy of the slaughter of innocent Americans.  Mr. Cosby is dead wrong here.  His unarmed son was murdered for God's sake <em class="blue">[6]</em></a>.”  Bill Cosby’s only son, Ennis, was shot and killed during a mugging along an interstate in Los Angeles while changing a tire in January 1997.  Turning to the issue of race, Nugent wrote, “<a href="http://www.newsmax.com/TedNugent/Bill-Cosby-Trayvon-Zimmerman/2012/06/15/id/442488" target="blank">I do agree with Mr. Cosby that the Trayvon Martin shooting has nothing to do with race.  Only empty-headed racists such as our black-panther loving Department of Justice believe otherwise.  Race does, however, play a significant role in the percentage of black Americans who are killed and wounded every single day in America. The overwhelming majority of blacks are slaughtered by other black hoodlums, the overwhelming majority of whom are involved in gangs and drugs—you know, that ‘victimless crime’ thing <em class="blue">[7]</em></a>.” </p></div><p class="fRight clearfix tRight">Sources <a href="http://www.newsmax.com/TedNugent/Bill-Cosby-Trayvon-Zimmerman/2012/06/15/id/442488" target="_blank">[1]</a> <a href="

<ul>
<li style="display: none;">Nugent was first asked to respond to a Department of Justice investigation into allegedly unconstitutional and discriminatory practices employed by anti-immigrant hardliner and Maricopa County, Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio.  “<a href="http://www.kfyi.com/player/?mid=21974170" target="_blank">Well it’s an ongoing manifestation of a government out of control.  And there is no better warrior, there is no better American hero, to stand up against Fedzilla than the greatest sheriff in the world, Sherriff Joe Arpaio.  I would like to take this opportunity if I might, Mike, because you’re bringing up an important global story that’s coming right out of Phoenix.  So I want to establish my absolute heart and soul support for Sherriff Joe and all the heroes of the Maricopa County Sherriff Department <em class="blue">[1]</em></a>.”</li>
<li style="display: none;">Nugent then turned to his appearance the previous night on CNN’s “Piers Morgan Tonight,” where he discussed the killing of unarmed 17-year-old Trayvon Martin by neighborhood watch “captain” George Zimmerman in Sanford, Florida, stating, “<a href="http://www.kfyi.com/player/?mid=21974170" target="_blank">[Piers Morgan] attempted to get me on the gun issue but I let him have it.  I kept it civil and I let him know that the Trayvon Martin/George Zimmerman situation is anything but what most of the media was attempting to depict it as.  We should be ashamed of ourselves that our media in the United States of America is convicting this man.  Convicting him of quote ‘cold-blooded murder’ when the facts are still not in <em class="blue">[2]</em></a>.”  He went on to <a href="http://www.lonang.com/exlibris/blackstone/bla-416.htm" target="_blank">falsely characterize <em class="blue">[3]</em></a> English Common Law, saying, “<a href="http://www.kfyi.com/player/?mid=21974170" target="_blank">Piers Morgan tried to relate the English law would have not stood for George Zimmerman defending himself.  And I had to clarify to the CNN viewing public that in England, by law, if someone breaks into your house, you have to retreat like a cowardly sheep out the back door, Mike.  People listening right now to you and I on KYFI might not believe this, but in England if someone breaks into your house you have a lawful duty to get out of it.  To escape.  To not defend yourself.  To not defend your home.  That’s anti- human, its absolutely repulsive, and it encourages crime <em class="blue">[4]</em></a>.”  Nugent was then asked to address the racial implications of the Trayvon Martin incident (Martin is African-American while Zimmerman is Caucasian/Hispanic) leading him to respond, “<a href="http://www.kfyi.com/player/?mid=21974170" target="_blank">[Piers Morgan] is convinced that the vast majority of Americans want this guy [George Zimmerman] arrested and convicted.  And I cleared him up on my intro.  I said Piers, ‘The vast majority of Americans do not want this guy arrested and convicted.  The vast majority of Americans are like the Nugent family.  Were not only praying for Trayvon Martin’s family and George Zimmerman’s family, but were still busy praying for the families of the ten black children slaughtered in Chicago on the same weekend that Trayvon Martin was killed.’  Forty-nine shootings in Chicago that weekend.  Ten dead.  But according to Jesse Jackson and Al ‘Not So’ Sharpton and all these left-wing Marxist media pundits, that all those dead black kids don’t matter because they were killed by black people.  The only black life that matters to Al Sharpton is when a black person is killed by maybe, not a Hispanic, but a white Hispanic … Nobody cares about race.  There’s only a handful of nutcases like Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson that care about race.  The rest of us value human life regardless of the color <em class="blue">[5]</em></a>.”  In a March 24-25, 2012 CNN poll, <a href="http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0312/74486.html" target="_blank">73% of Americans <em class="blue">[6]</em></a> said that George Zimmerman should be arrested.  </li>

This, too, may be ugly and uncomfortable, but we must make hard choices that force people into making smart, responsible decisions … Our schools need to be dramatically restructured.  I advocate that our kids go to school year-round from 8 a.m. until 5 p.m.  We need to make it easier to fire poor teachers and reward good ones and bust up the National Education Association [union] … If you can’t afford to have kids, quit having them and expecting the taxpayers to pay for them.

<ul>
<li style="display: none;">Nugent was first asked to respond to a Department of Justice investigation into allegedly unconstitutional and discriminatory practices employed by anti-immigrant hardliner and Maricopa County, Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio.  “<a href="http://www.kfyi.com/player/?mid=21974170" target="_blank">Well it’s an ongoing manifestation of a government out of control.  And there is no better warrior, there is no better American hero, to stand up against Fedzilla than the greatest sheriff in the world, Sherriff Joe Arpaio.  I would like to take this opportunity if I might, Mike, because you’re bringing up an important global story that’s coming right out of Phoenix.  So I want to establish my absolute heart and soul support for Sherriff Joe and all the heroes of the Maricopa County Sherriff Department <em class="blue">[1]</em></a>.”</li>
<li style="display: none;">Nugent then turned to his appearance the previous night on CNN’s “Piers Morgan Tonight,” where he discussed the killing of unarmed 17-year-old Trayvon Martin by neighborhood watch “captain” George Zimmerman in Sanford, Florida, stating, “<a href="http://www.kfyi.com/player/?mid=21974170" target="_blank">[Piers Morgan] attempted to get me on the gun issue but I let him have it.  I kept it civil and I let him know that the Trayvon Martin/George Zimmerman situation is anything but what most of the media was attempting to depict it as.  We should be ashamed of ourselves that our media in the United States of America is convicting this man.  Convicting him of quote ‘cold-blooded murder’ when the facts are still not in <em class="blue">[2]</em></a>.”  He went on to <a href="http://www.lonang.com/exlibris/blackstone/bla-416.htm" target="_blank">falsely characterize <em class="blue">[3]</em></a> English Common Law, saying, “<a href="http://www.kfyi.com/player/?mid=21974170" target="_blank">Piers Morgan tried to relate the English law would have not stood for George Zimmerman defending himself.  And I had to clarify to the CNN viewing public that in England, by law, if someone breaks into your house, you have to retreat like a cowardly sheep out the back door, Mike.  People listening right now to you and I on KYFI might not believe this, but in England if someone breaks into your house you have a lawful duty to get out of it.  To escape.  To not defend yourself.  To not defend your home.  That’s anti- human, its absolutely repulsive, and it encourages crime <em class="blue">[4]</em></a>.”  Nugent was then asked to address the racial implications of the Trayvon Martin incident (Martin is African-American while Zimmerman is Caucasian/Hispanic) leading him to respond, “<a href="http://www.kfyi.com/player/?mid=21974170" target="_blank">[Piers Morgan] is convinced that the vast majority of Americans want this guy [George Zimmerman] arrested and convicted.  And I cleared him up on my intro.  I said Piers, ‘The vast majority of Americans do not want this guy arrested and convicted.  The vast majority of Americans are like the Nugent family.  Were not only praying for Trayvon Martin’s family and George Zimmerman’s family, but were still busy praying for the families of the ten black children slaughtered in Chicago on the same weekend that Trayvon Martin was killed.’  Forty-nine shootings in Chicago that weekend.  Ten dead.  But according to Jesse Jackson and Al ‘Not So’ Sharpton and all these left-wing Marxist media pundits, that all those dead black kids don’t matter because they were killed by black people.  The only black life that matters to Al Sharpton is when a black person is killed by maybe, not a Hispanic, but a white Hispanic … Nobody cares about race.  There’s only a handful of nutcases like Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson that care about race.  The rest of us value human life regardless of the color <em class="blue">[5]</em></a>.”  In a March 24-25, 2012 CNN poll, <a href="http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0312/74486.html" target="_blank">73% of Americans <em class="blue">[6]</em></a> said that George Zimmerman should be arrested.  </li>

In some urban areas, over 50 percent of black kids drop out of high school, thereby condemning themselves to a life of poverty and dependence, a prison cell or an early grave. This is not a redeemable family value. Dependency on welfare breeds more dependency, which breeds more despair, hopelessness and anger.

<ul>
<li style="display: none;">“Look at this audience. Couldn’t we end the War on Terror ourselves? And I’ll play Commander in Chief for a minute. Here’s rules of engagement. Kill ‘em all.”</li>
<li style="display: none;">We’re a little spoiled in Texas and Arizona and Wyoming and Vermont. Can you be spoiled in Vermont? And Kansas. We’re starting to get something that looks like the Second Amendment in some places, because it doesn’t exist anywhere yet.</li>
<li style="display: none;">That’s the Second Amendment. If you’re 18 and you’re not convicted of a felony or a violent crime you get to keep and you get to bear 24/7/365 anywhere you damn well please.</li>
<li style="display: none;">My name’s Ted Nugent. I’m 66 years old and I’ve never been in a gun-free zone.       Ever.</li>
<li style="display: none;">I cannot comprehend the soullessness of unarmed and helpless.</li>
<li style="display: none;">So the community scammer [President Barack Obama] didn’t get to be the Commander in Chief because he’s clever. [Democratic presidential candidate] Hillary Clinton, [National Security Advisor] Susan Rice and [IRS employee] Lois Lerner aren’t in jail yet because they’re sneaky. They commit their crimes in the wide open and We The People have failed to arrest them yet.</li>
<li style="display: none;">Whatever we want is always the right thing.</li>
<li style="display: none;">Here’s the only gun law we need: Don’t shoot the wrong guy.</li>
<li style="display: none;">Back when Richard Pryor’s afro caught on fire, I knew I was on the mountaintop of comedy … But thank God the liberal media has actually gotten funnier than Richard Pryor’s afro igniting.</li>
<li style="display: none;">Don’t back away from the storm. Look for the storm. Put your head down and walk proudly right into the storm. Let the wimps and the French back away. You just keep plowing forward, the higher the drifts, the worse the wind, the more wolves, kill ‘em all.</li>
<li style="display: none;">Go forth into that quiet night and let our government know we want separation of powers. Tell them to be the watchdogs our Founding Fathers wanted them to be, not to be a united force against the citizens. So take this good [guns] and use it against the bad and the ugly. It’s a target rich environment. If it was duck season, there’d be so many ducks, you could just close your eyes and shoot ‘em. Don’t close your eyes and don’t shoot just yet, but plow forward and demand accountability … So now let’s take all that good and crush the bad and the ugly, when we identify the gun-grabbers and freedom-haters.</li>
<li style="display: none;">If your child is dying, and there’s only one way to get to the doctor, would you get on [Senate Minority Leader] Harry Reid’s boat to get there? Then your child’s dead. I’d get on the boat, get there, and then I’d shoot him.</li>

While I don’t believe this for a [former New York City] Mayor Bloomburg [sic] smoke-free, fat-free gun-hating second, I’m willing to lead a charge for closing this ‘loophole’ if the left wing, say Piers Morgan or Michael Moore, will agree to promoting and advocating closing what many hardworking and taxpaying Americans believe to be a federal voting loophole. The federal voting loophole is this: People who pay no federal income taxes are allowed to vote in federal elections. Arguably, this is a ‘loophole’ since these voters have no federal income tax flesh in the game. The producers who pay more than our fair share believe that it is grossly unfair for those who pay no federal income taxes to be able to vote in federal elections determining how other Americans’ hard-earned tax dollars are spent <em class="blue">[1]</em></a>.” The “Gun Show Loophole” refers to private sales of firearms that are conducted at gun shows without background checks.  </p></div><p class="fRight clearfix tRight">Sources <a href="http://www.wnd.com/2013/12/uncle-teds-grand-compromise/" target="_blank">[1]</a></p></li><li class="inner_topic clearfix" style="display: none;"><div class="categories" title="republican_party_gop_"><strong>Republican Party (GOP)</strong></div><div class="state_text"><p>In a November 12, 2013 op-ed for World Net Daily, Nugent blamed social welfare programs for a mass shooting at a barbershop in Detroit, Michigan, in which <a href='http://www.myfoxdetroit.com/story/23902143/3rd-person-dies-in-detroit-barbershop-shooting"' target="blank">a man dressed in body armor shot and killed three people <em class="blue">[1]</em></a>.

In 1971, he wrote a book called “Rules for Radicals” which described his theory and methods of organizing.  Richard Cloward and Frances Piven were sociologists and political activists. They outlined a political strategy in 1966 that called for overloading the U.S. public welfare system in order to precipitate a crisis that would lead to a replacement of the welfare system with a national system of "guaranteed annual income and thus an end to poverty."  President Barack Obama has never publicly mentioned Saul Alinsky, Richard Cloward or Frances Piven nor, has he supported a guaranteed annual income in place of welfare. </p></div><p class="fRight clearfix tRight">Sources <a href="https://twitter.com/TedNugent/status/258395913226186752" target="_blank">[1]</a></p></li><li class="inner_topic clearfix" style="display: none;"><div class="categories" title="republican_party_gop_"><strong>Republican Party (GOP)</strong></div><div class="state_text"><p>On October 10, 2012, Nugent tweeted, “<a href="https://twitter.com/TedNugent/status/256044613893230592" target="blank">Yeah thats it-The FtHood massacre was a workplace act of violence Yeah, thats the ticket Goodcall gang Obama lying enemies of America. damnU <em class="blue">[1]</em></a>.” Nugent was referring to a mass shooting at Fort Hood on November 5, 2009.

Every day, every school, at every level.

He’s one of the best of the best and I really believe that what [Republican presidential candidate] Mitt Romney has learned over the years really makes him better than just a good man, he’s now a great man.  He would be such a vast improvement over this current criminal administration and the policies that clearly are against the American way and against being the best that you can be.  So, Mitt Romney picked the right guy.  Paul Ryan’s a real blood-brother, man … Bow-hunting really is the most difficult thing in the world, as far as a self-imposed challenge goes … There’s a real higher level of awareness that one attains, that one has to aspire to and Paul Ryan has achieved that.  He’s a dedicated, very successful bow-hunter.  And that higher level of awareness that drives your higher level of awareness on every level of life is what has made [Paul Ryan] a great representative, a great U.S. Constitution, Bill of Rights representative of ‘We the People’ of Wisconsin. So, what he can do in America, I think we have seen with [Wisconsin Governor] Scott Walker, Tommy Thompson, the past governor and hopefully U.S. Senate from Wisconsin and with Paul Ryan as Congressman.  I mean, Wisconsin went from a suburb of the hash-bash hippie hell of Madison to being a really accountable, living within their means, balancing their budget, and getting rid of the fat and the waste in Wisconsin <em class="blue">[1]</em></a>.”  Governor Scott <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/rickungar/2012/02/14/will-gov-scott-walker-ever-come-clean-on-wisconsins-budget-deficit/" target="blank">Walker did not balance Wisconsin’s budget <em class="blue">[2]</em></a>. In a letter sent by Mike Huebsch, Walker’s Administration Secretary, to the U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services in December 2011, Huebsch stated that Wisconsin would have an “undisclosed deficit” from January, 2012 through June, 2013. Nugent then explained why he thought polls showed some swing states leaning towards President Barack Obama in the election, stating, “<a href="http://stlouis.cbslocal.com/2012/10/01/mark-reardon-ted-nugent-st-louis-police-chief-dan-isom-actor-ben-stein/" target="blank">When you buy votes, when you buy entire societal blocks with handouts and with promises that clearly can’t be kept.

So, that’s why Mitt Romney’s 47 percent statement is statistically irrefutable <em class="blue">[4]</em></a>.”  Nugent referred to controversial comments Mitt Romney made at a private fundraiser earlier this year.  Romney stated, “<a href="http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/09/secret-video-romney-private-fundraiser" target="blank">There are 47 percent of the people who will vote for the president no matter what.  All right, there are 47 percent who are with him, who are dependent upon government, who believe that they are victims, who believe the government has a responsibility to care for them, who believe that they are entitled to health care, to food, to housing, to you-name-it—that that's an entitlement.  And the government should give it to them.  And they will vote for this president no matter what. ... These are people who pay no income tax. ... [M]y job is not to worry about those people.  I'll never convince them they should take personal responsibility and care for their lives <em class="blue">[5]</em></a>."

Facts are facts … As I’ve written before, for at least the past 50 years the Democratic Party has intentionally engineered a class of political ‘victims’ who have been bamboozled into being dependent on the federal government for their subsistence, including food, housing and now health care.  They get this without paying any federal income taxes, and that’s wrong.  Something for nothing is always a scam.  This is how you buy votes, plain and simple … Alternatively, the majority of federal income taxes are paid by the top wage earners, the very group of individuals the Democrats and President Obama constantly demonize and want to punish by raising their taxes even higher.  This is what’s called ‘fair’ in this bizzarro world.  Those who pay nothing can continue to pay nothing, and those who pay all will pay more … The Democratic Party exists because it promotes the creation of dependence on Fedzilla.  They have intentionally created the real political victims, many of whom have been victimized by the Democrats for decades … Through the creation of the Nanny State, the Democrats have destroyed lives, families and entire communities, and convinced some Americans that they can’t achieve anything without Fedzilla’s help. They have their own soulless Declaration of Dependence.  That’s downright pathetic.  While creating this voting bloc of handcrafted victims, the Democrats have also waged an artful campaign to paint Republicans as a group of arrogant, greedy rich people.  Some Democrats like Vice President Joseph R. Biden take their venom-filled lies about the GOP even a step lower … He’s a race-baiting yarn-spinner.  He should be made to wear a dunce hat and stand in the corner for the remainder of the campaign … No able-bodied American should get anything for free while doing nothing to earn it.  Put a rake, shovel, paint brush or broom in their hands.  That will instill some pride back in their lives that the Democrats have worked double-time to make extinct … What Fedzilla has done to individuals and businesses is not a victimless crime.  It’s killing America <em class="blue">[1]</em></a>.”  Nugent was referring to controversial comments Mitt Romney made at a private fundraiser in May 2012.  Romney stated, “<a href="http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/09/secret-video-romney-private-fundraiser" target="blank">There are 47 percent of the people who will vote for the president no matter what. All right, there are 47 percent who are with him, who are dependent upon government, who believe that they are victims, who believe the government has a responsibility to care for them, who believe that they are entitled to health care, to food, to housing, to you-name-it –that that's an entitlement.  And the government should give it to them.  And they will vote for this president no matter what. ... These are people who pay no income tax. ... [M]y job is not to worry about those people.

A law enforcement official of Game Departments of the United States of America do not respect and are not limited by the Fourth Amendment … They don’t need just cause.

Or just on a bad day … So that’s offensive on all levels but there’s also some other jack-booted Gestapo maneuvers going on these days like the Gibson raids … While we’re sitting here, my email’s going [noise] blowing up with stories of heartbreak: where a teenager, who’s never broke the law in his life, who’s never been in trouble with the law in his life, his family [is] law-abiding, their family has been bankrupted because the U.S. Fish and Wildlife thugs, the same ones that raided Gibson … Just the examples would gag you … When Governor [and Republican presidential nominee Mitt] Romney becomes Commander-in-Chief, I pray to God, along with a great Vice President, Paul Ryan … have got to look into these violations of civil rights and basic human rights at the hands of agencies gone mad … Vote Romney and Paul Ryan as president <em class="blue">[1]</em></a>.”  The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service <a href="http://www.fws.gov/policy/445fw1.html#sect6" target="blank">is subject to the requirements of the Fourth Amendment <em class="blue">[2]</em></a>; however, some statutes give U.S. Fish and Wildlife agents authority to conduct warrantless searches.  Nugent was referring to several U.S. Fish and Wildlife Department raids on the guitar maker Gibson for importing endangered wood.</p>
<p>Turning to the topic of sexual assault of minors, Nugent stated, “<a href="http://noisyroom.net/blog/2012/09/01/ted-nugent-warns-feds-arresting-innocent-citizens-without-warrants/" target="blank">We’ve got to create community review boards for judges who keep letting child rapists out, when that judge knows if that child rapist is let out on the streets, he will rape again.  And our court systems answer to that is to register them?  To know where they live?  In a neighborhood instead of a cage, instead of jail <em class="blue">[3]</em></a>?” In 1978, Nugent began a relationship with <a href="http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2012/04/19/ted-nugent-american-traitor-misogynist-romney-surrogate/" target="blank">seventeen-year-old <em class="blue">[4]</em></a> Hawaii native Pele Massa. Due to the age difference they could not marry so Nugent joined Massa’s parents in signing documents to make himself her legal guardian. In 1998 interview with VH1, Nugent spoke about his “weakness for young women.”</p>
<p>In part two of the interview with <i>Patriot Update</i>, Nugent stated, “<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIyyxZN5f1w&amp;feature=youtu.be" target="blank">I hold the most important office on earth, ‘We the People.’  I am a we the people activist on behalf of my family, my neighborhood, my state, my country, and mostly that soldier in a box who died fighting for the U.S. Constitution.

Kasim condemned me recently on one of the news shows … I love when the brown-shirts hate people saving Jews.  Anyhow, the idiots and the America-haters hate me.

My advice to Mr. Romney is to tell the Democrats to pound sand … What the Democrats want to do is to play class warfare, pit rich against poor. Playing class warfare is all the proof you need to know that the Democratic Party despises successful people such as Mr. Romney. The Democrats abhor success. They would rather Americans be beholden to Fedzilla for food stamps and other government programs than go out and become tremendously successful on their own. The Democrats hate success because they know success ultimately breeds success. The more successful Americans are, the less power and influence the Democrats can have over them, which means the less political power the Democrats can wield. That’s not a good thing for socialists and other big-government addicts and dependents. The “man” keeping down the people is not a successful person such as Mr. Romney, but rather the Democratic Party, which buys their votes by enslaving its supporters with government programs and checks, funded with the tax dollars that people like Mr. Romney have paid … With the sizable and legal pile of money Mr. Romney is reported to have made and banked, my hope is that he has legally hid as much of it as possible from Fedzilla. I would much rather Mr. Romney have his money than surrender it to Uncle Sham, who burns through our hard-earned tax dollars with impunity … Should Mr. Romney release his records, let’s wait and see if [President Barack Obama] then releases all his academic records, complete health records and other documents.

The result was the doors of the cuckoo nests were flung open and the patients stumbled out.  Now they are everywhere.  You can’t visit any city in America without encountering dirty people who are severely mentally impaired roaming the streets.  Pushing shopping carts, mumbling to themselves, sleeping under bridges or in parks and basically being a nuisance, they ultimately endanger themselves.  Most are not violent, just certifiably crazy by anyone’s standards.  The real discussion that needs to occur in America is how we finally throw off the shackles of political correctness, quit worrying about ‘feelings’ and simply restrict the rights of psychotics by making it easier to lock them up for their safety and the safety of others.

Four police officers from the LAPD who took part in the incident were later tried.  Three of them were acquitted, and the jury failed to reach a verdict regarding the fourth.  The acquittals are generally considered to have triggered the 1992 Los Angeles riots, in which 53 people were killed, and over 2,000 injured.

If you listen carefully to these America-hating, social-engineering liberals, virtually all behavior, conduct, morals and beliefs make America stronger.  This, of course, is toxic, brain-dead logic that leaves ordinary Americans shaking and scratching their heads in confusion and disgust.  We recognize bull dung when we hear, see and smell it, and we have no desire whatsoever to embrace it … The left is forcing its version of diversity throughout our society and culture.  According to the left and its acolytes, we are supposed to respect people who refuse to respect Old Glory or learn English, look for a job or put forth the effort to do an honest day’s work.  We are supposed to respect all cultures, values, laws and religions—even when they have proved throughout history to be dangerous and diametrically opposed to our American way of life, customs, laws and traditions.  It will be a cold day in hell before I embrace voodoolike religions and unclean stone-age cultures that retard progress instead of advancing it.  The real issue is that by forcing diversity and multicultural nonsense in our workplaces, schools and government agencies on people who still cherish common sense and traditional American values, we’re ripping the nation apart <em class="blue">[1]</em></a>.”  Nugent went on to claim that Attorney General Eric Holder’s statement that some critics of President Obama are motivated by race is “the ultimate act of racism.”  He continued, “<a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2012/jan/9/diversity-perversity/" target="_blank">I respect diverse people who respect and cherish basic American customs, traditions, goodwill and values.  I have no respect for left-wingers who employ intimidation to make multiculturalism or diversity mandatory as the law of the land.  The diversity punks believe in racial set-asides and preferences.  You won’t ever solve discrimination by engaging in reverse discrimination. Maybe a racist like Jesse Jackson or Mr. Holder believes in reverse discrimination, but ordinary Americans do not.  We are much too focused and intelligent to buy into such Jabberwocky.  Real diversity, real change, real progress is accomplished by promoting and embracing Western culture, values and traditions, which is what made America great and created the greatest quality of life ever.

The lunatic fringe has given the green light to corruption, fraud, deceit, lying, the abuse of power the likes of which I’ve never seen… Let’s be perfectly honest—we have a president of the United States of America who was raised by communists that hate America.  Went to a church regularly—well, they call it a church, I call it a voodoo cave.  They went to a voodoo church where they preached hate for America, where it was racist worse than the Ku Klux Klan.

<li style="display: none;">“America has the dumbest, fattest, most disconnected, slovenly children in the world thanks to the [National Education Association (NEA)].  NEA, unions, no thank you.  Move to Canada.  They already have policies that reward slovenliness up there.”</li>

Nugent responded by posting twice more on the subject that day.

In this third post, Nugent shared a meme with a photo of Nazis subjugating Jews during the time of the Holocaust.

<li style="display: none;">We’re a little spoiled in Texas and Arizona and Wyoming and Vermont. Can you be spoiled in Vermont? And Kansas. We’re starting to get something that looks like the Second Amendment in some places, because it doesn’t exist anywhere yet.</li>
<li style="display: none;">That’s the Second Amendment. If you’re 18 and you’re not convicted of a felony or a violent crime you get to keep and you get to bear 24/7/365 anywhere you damn well please.</li>
<li style="display: none;">My name’s Ted Nugent. I’m 66 years old and I’ve never been in a gun-free zone.       Ever.</li>
<li style="display: none;">I cannot comprehend the soullessness of unarmed and helpless.</li>
<li style="display: none;">So the community scammer [President Barack Obama] didn’t get to be the Commander in Chief because he’s clever. [Democratic presidential candidate] Hillary Clinton, [National Security Advisor] Susan Rice and [IRS employee] Lois Lerner aren’t in jail yet because they’re sneaky. They commit their crimes in the wide open and We The People have failed to arrest them yet.</li>
<li style="display: none;">Whatever we want is always the right thing.</li>
<li style="display: none;">Here’s the only gun law we need: Don’t shoot the wrong guy.</li>
<li style="display: none;">Back when Richard Pryor’s afro caught on fire, I knew I was on the mountaintop of comedy … But thank God the liberal media has actually gotten funnier than Richard Pryor’s afro igniting.</li>
<li style="display: none;">Don’t back away from the storm. Look for the storm. Put your head down and walk proudly right into the storm. Let the wimps and the French back away. You just keep plowing forward, the higher the drifts, the worse the wind, the more wolves, kill ‘em all.</li>
<li style="display: none;">Go forth into that quiet night and let our government know we want separation of powers. Tell them to be the watchdogs our Founding Fathers wanted them to be, not to be a united force against the citizens. So take this good [guns] and use it against the bad and the ugly. It’s a target rich environment. If it was duck season, there’d be so many ducks, you could just close your eyes and shoot ‘em. Don’t close your eyes and don’t shoot just yet, but plow forward and demand accountability … So now let’s take all that good and crush the bad and the ugly, when we identify the gun-grabbers and freedom-haters.</li>
<li style="display: none;">If your child is dying, and there’s only one way to get to the doctor, would you get on [Senate Minority Leader] Harry Reid’s boat to get there? Then your child’s dead. I’d get on the boat, get there, and then I’d shoot him.</li>

Barack Obama hates freedom.  Barack Obama's voting record, his upbringing, his education, his words, his actions, his misdeeds, all reek of everything anti-American, anti-Constitution, anti-Bill of Rights.  The latter of which is most deviously manifested in his voting record against the individual right to keep and bear arms … America faces doom if we re-elect Barack Obama to the presidency.  It is a dire, dangerous forecast for freedom … If he wins in November he won't have to kowtow, he won't have to placate anybody anymore.  He will be able to go for the jugular, and that includes the jugular of the Second Amendment.  He will begin again what he did in Illinois as a gangster politician and go against gun rights, he will tax ammunition, he will ban certain types of bullets, and he will ban certain types of firearms.  His goal is Attorney General Eric Holder's goal: namely, to brainwash Americans into believing that guns are bad and that the Second Amendment does not mean individuals have the right to keep and bear arms.  Barack Obama is a smoke-and-mirrors scam artist who has convinced people he believes one and one equals two, while he shoves three-and-a-half down your throat … In November 2012, we are voting for [Republican presidential candidate Mitt] Romney/[Republican vice presidential candidate Paul]Ryan because we are voting for the very soul of America.

They are saturated in the media and entertainment, or by the entertainment industry, with violence.  And I think too many of our young people, in particular our young men, are fascinated with violence, and in particular fascinated with guns.  What we need to do is change the way in which people think about guns, especially young people, and make it something that’s not cool, that it’s not acceptable, it’s not hip to carry a gun anymore, in the way in which we changed our attitudes about cigarettes.  When I was growing up, people smoked all the time…but over time we changed the way people thought about smoking…and that’s what I think we need to do with guns, really change the way people think about them … This is not going to be something that’s very easy to do, because we are, quite frankly, fighting something that appears every day on television, on the radio, in our popular music, in movies that these kids are exposed to … We need to get really innovative, really creative things that are gonna grab the attention of these kids and change, as I said, the way in which they think about guns … I have asked the school board to make a part of every day some kind of anti-violence, anti-gun message.  Every day, every school, at every level.  One thing I think is clear with young people, and adults as well, is that we just have to be repetitive about this … We need to do this every day of the week and just really brainwash people into thinking about guns in a vastly different way <em class="blue">[2]</em></a>.” </p></div><p class="fRight clearfix tRight">Sources <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Hollywood/2012/10/01/BG-Interview-Ted-Nugent-On-Gun-Rights-Liberty-And-The-Dangers-Of-An-Obama-Second-Term" target="_blank">[1]</a> <a href="

He’s one of the best of the best and I really believe that what [Republican presidential candidate] Mitt Romney has learned over the years really makes him better than just a good man, he’s now a great man.  He would be such a vast improvement over this current criminal administration and the policies that clearly are against the American way and against being the best that you can be.  So, Mitt Romney picked the right guy.  Paul Ryan’s a real blood-brother, man … Bow-hunting really is the most difficult thing in the world, as far as a self-imposed challenge goes … There’s a real higher level of awareness that one attains, that one has to aspire to and Paul Ryan has achieved that.  He’s a dedicated, very successful bow-hunter.  And that higher level of awareness that drives your higher level of awareness on every level of life is what has made [Paul Ryan] a great representative, a great U.S. Constitution, Bill of Rights representative of ‘We the People’ of Wisconsin. So, what he can do in America, I think we have seen with [Wisconsin Governor] Scott Walker, Tommy Thompson, the past governor and hopefully U.S. Senate from Wisconsin and with Paul Ryan as Congressman.  I mean, Wisconsin went from a suburb of the hash-bash hippie hell of Madison to being a really accountable, living within their means, balancing their budget, and getting rid of the fat and the waste in Wisconsin <em class="blue">[1]</em></a>.”  Governor Scott <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/rickungar/2012/02/14/will-gov-scott-walker-ever-come-clean-on-wisconsins-budget-deficit/" target="blank">Walker did not balance Wisconsin’s budget <em class="blue">[2]</em></a>. In a letter sent by Mike Huebsch, Walker’s Administration Secretary, to the U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services in December 2011, Huebsch stated that Wisconsin would have an “undisclosed deficit” from January, 2012 through June, 2013. Nugent then explained why he thought polls showed some swing states leaning towards President Barack Obama in the election, stating, “<a href="http://stlouis.cbslocal.com/2012/10/01/mark-reardon-ted-nugent-st-louis-police-chief-dan-isom-actor-ben-stein/" target="blank">When you buy votes, when you buy entire societal blocks with handouts and with promises that clearly can’t be kept.  But this president, President Obama and his gang, they have literally smoke and mirrored their way into this artificial reign of terror. Unfortunately, the terror isn’t artificial.  And so the people that support Barack Obama and this current corruption, the current abuse in the U.S. government, it’s because they’re getting something out of it <em class="blue">[3]</em></a>.” Nugent told the radio host, Mark Reardon, “<a href="http://stlouis.cbslocal.com/2012/10/01/mark-reardon-ted-nugent-st-louis-police-chief-dan-isom-actor-ben-stein/" target="blank">There’s a bunch of us, like you and me and people that work really hard and get up early and put their heart and soul into being the most productive asset they can to their fellow man …  Barack Obama’s voter block, either you’re a liability or you believe people can intentionally put themselves in the position of a liability.  So, that’s why Mitt Romney’s 47 percent statement is statistically irrefutable <em class="blue">[4]</em></a>.”  Nugent referred to controversial comments Mitt Romney made at a private fundraiser earlier this year.  Romney stated, “<a href="http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/09/secret-video-romney-private-fundraiser" target="blank">There are 47 percent of the people who will vote for the president no matter what.  All right, there are 47 percent who are with him, who are dependent upon government, who believe that they are victims, who believe the government has a responsibility to care for them, who believe that they are entitled to health care, to food, to housing, to you-name-it—that that's an entitlement.  And the government should give it to them.  And they will vote for this president no matter what. ... These are people who pay no income tax. ... [M]y job is not to worry about those people.  I'll never convince them they should take personal responsibility and care for their lives <em class="blue">[5]</em></a>." Nugent continued, stating, “<a href="http://stlouis.cbslocal.com/2012/10/01/mark-reardon-ted-nugent-st-louis-police-chief-dan-isom-actor-ben-stein/" target="blank">This President [Barack Obama] has bought the gay vote, overall, just basically speaking, obviously there’s a bunch of smart gay people out there that ain’t buyin’ this crap. He’s bought the black vote, event though there’s a bunch of really smart, independent, rugged individuals in the black community.  And the female vote with this lie that we’re somehow gonna take away their health care because we won’t buy them contraception.  I mean, every aspect of Barack Obama’s campaign would be laughable if it was just a movie <em class="blue">[6]</em></a>.”  Nugent was referring to a <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/health/diseasesconditionsandhealthtopics/health_insurance_and_managed_care/health_care_reform/contraception/index.html" target="blank">January 2012 Obama Administration announcement <em class="blue">[7]</em></a> that the “Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act” requires employers to provide health insurance which covers contraception for women free of charge.  </p></div><p class="fRight clearfix tRight">Sources <a href="http://stlouis.cbslocal.com/2012/10/01/mark-reardon-ted-nugent-st-louis-police-chief-dan-isom-actor-ben-stein/" target="_blank">[1]</a> <a href="

We would be wise to remember when then-Sen. Barack Obama was campaigning for the presidency and told Joe the Plumber, “I think when you spread the wealth around, it’s good for everybody.” Those are the words of a socialist who learned his lessons well from his socialist upbringing and on the streets of Chicago as a community organizer … Socialists are punks who think they are smarter than ordinary Americans and that ordinary Americans are so dumb they need to be managed by Fedzillacrats in Washington.

<ul>
<li style="display: none;">Commenting on the position of the administration of President Barack Obama that the wealthy should pay more taxes, Nugent stated, “<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-ETxVyHZuQ" target="_blank">Let’s call a spade a spade.  I mean the entire current administration under the America-hating Barack Obama, and the America-hating Joe Biden, and the American Constitution criminal Eric Holder.  Tim Geithner is the perfect example of what the current American government stinks like.  Because Tim Geithner is a tax thief.  Tim Geithner was caught not paying his taxes.  So instead of being in jail, Tim Geithner, the tax thief, is actually in charge of our financial system.  Are you kidding me, why don’t we just hire [serial killer] Jeffery Dahmer to be in charge of the children’s playground?  I mean this whole administration is so corrupt.  It abuses power like no one in the history of the United States of America has ever done.  And Tim Geithner is a poster child.  Just like Eric Holder.  Running guns to the Mexican drug kings.  Are you kidding me?  Could it get crazier?  Could it get more criminal than this?  We have criminals.  We have American-hating maniacs in our government.  And Tim Geithner’s latest nonsense is a perfect example of that <em class="blue">[1]</em></a>.”  At one point, while pronouncing U.S. Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner’s last name, Nugent appeared to call him a “kike.”</li>
<li style="display: none;">Commenting on 2012 Republican presidential candidates Mitt Romney, Rick Santorum, Newt Gingrich, and Ron Paul, he stated, “<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-ETxVyHZuQ" target="_blank">I have great admiration, in varying degrees, for each and every one of them.  Each and every one of these candidates have some really really quality positive points about them.  And each one of them would make a vastly superior president of the United States than the current mess that we’re in right now.  That should be perfectly clear to anybody with a brain.  But ultimately these guys got to go down to the Army-Navy surplus store and buy themselves a box of scrotums.  They’ve gotta get some balls … These four presidential candidates have to get a little tougher, a little bit more fist pounding on the bully pulpit, and identify the curse, the abject curse that is the United States government the way it stands right now in the hands of Barack Hussein Obama and Eric Holder, et al <em class="blue">[2]</em></a>.” </li>
<li style="display: none;">Continuing on the topic of the Obama administration, Nugent stated, “<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-ETxVyHZuQ" target="_blank">Speaking of ridiculous policies, anti-American policies, this current anti-American monster in the White House, this administration is blatant and flagrantly abusing the Constitution, violating the Constitution, and continuing on a death march for America <em class="blue">[3]</em></a>.” </li>
<li style="display: none;">Turning to the topic of entitlement programs, Nugent claimed, “<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-ETxVyHZuQ" target="_blank">The entire welfare program is slavery.  We are literally enslaving people to feed off of a government and rewarding people to be the worst that they can be, to not try something.  Get rid of this embarrassment that there is a list of jobs that Americans aren’t willing to do.  Are you kidding me?  How about the condition where Americans have actually given up looking for work.  That is so embarrassing, why don’t these people just move to France <em class="blue">[4]</em></a>.”  </li>
</ul></div><p class="fRight clearfix tRight">Sources</p></li><li class="inner_topic clearfix" style="display: none;"><div class="categories" title="conspiracy_theory"><strong>Conspiracy Theory</strong></div><div class="state_text"><p>In a January 9, 2012 op-ed for the <i>Washington Times</i>, Nugent wrote, “<a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2012/jan/9/diversity-perversity/" target="_blank">Diversity is America’s greatest strength, according to the left and its socialist, Marxist, commie cohorts and co-conspirators running rampant across the country.  If you listen carefully to these America-hating, social-engineering liberals, virtually all behavior, conduct, morals and beliefs make America stronger.  This, of course, is toxic, brain-dead logic that leaves ordinary Americans shaking and scratching their heads in confusion and disgust.  We recognize bull dung when we hear, see and smell it, and we have no desire whatsoever to embrace it … The left is forcing its version of diversity throughout our society and culture.  According to the left and its acolytes, we are supposed to respect people who refuse to respect Old Glory or learn English, look for a job or put forth the effort to do an honest day’s work.  We are supposed to respect all cultures, values, laws and religions—even when they have proved throughout history to be dangerous and diametrically opposed to our American way of life, customs, laws and traditions.  It will be a cold day in hell before I embrace voodoolike religions and unclean stone-age cultures that retard progress instead of advancing it.  The real issue is that by forcing diversity and multicultural nonsense in our workplaces, schools and government agencies on people who still cherish common sense and traditional American values, we’re ripping the nation apart <em class="blue">[1]</em></a>.”  Nugent went on to claim that Attorney General Eric Holder’s statement that some critics of President Obama are motivated by race is “the ultimate act of racism.”  He continued, “<a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2012/jan/9/diversity-perversity/" target="_blank">I respect diverse people who respect and cherish basic American customs, traditions, goodwill and values.  I have no respect for left-wingers who employ intimidation to make multiculturalism or diversity mandatory as the law of the land.  The diversity punks believe in racial set-asides and preferences.  You won’t ever solve discrimination by engaging in reverse discrimination. Maybe a racist like Jesse Jackson or Mr. Holder believes in reverse discrimination, but ordinary Americans do not.  We are much too focused and intelligent to buy into such Jabberwocky.  Real diversity, real change, real progress is accomplished by promoting and embracing Western culture, values and traditions, which is what made America great and created the greatest quality of life ever. Weakening this proven methodology under the artful guise of diversity, multiculturalism and political correctness is every bit as insidious a threat to America as are voodoo-inspired terrorist punks <em class="blue">[2]</em></a>.”</p></div><p class="fRight clearfix tRight">Sources <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2012/jan/9/diversity-perversity/" target="_blank">[1]</a> <a href="

<li style="display: none;">“You have a warrior [in Wisconsin] now.  Scott Walker, the [Republican] governor of Wisconsin, is a warrior.  He is a great man.  He is upgrading the quality of life in Wisconsin—bringing accountability, pragmatism, and rugged individualism back to the forefront of a great state.” </li>
<li style="display: none;">“There’s a lunatic fringe.  There’s always been a lunatic fringe.  Unfortunately and heartbreakingly, the lunatic fringe now has a president.  The lunatic fringe has given the green light to corruption, fraud, deceit, lying, the abuse of power the likes of which I’ve never seen… Let’s be perfectly honest—we have a president of the United States of America who was raised by communists that hate America.  Went to a church regularly—well, they call it a church, I call it a voodoo cave.  They went to a voodoo church where they preached hate for America, where it was racist worse than the Ku Klux Klan.  Are you kidding me?  This guy is the president of the United States?”  </li>
<li style="display: none;">“America has the dumbest, fattest, most disconnected, slovenly children in the world thanks to the [National Education Association (NEA)].  NEA, unions, no thank you.  Move to Canada.  They already have policies that reward slovenliness up there.”</li>
<li style="display: none;">“Let me tell you who the goons are, who the lunatic fringe is:  Eric Holder, Tim Geithner, Hillary Clinton, who side with the goons, the savages, the rapists, the murderers of the U.N.”</li>
<li style="display: none;">“By voting in [Republican] Scott Walker as Governor of Wisconsin you just said thank you to the family of a dead soldier.” </li>

<ul>
<li style="display: none;">“Look at this audience. Couldn’t we end the War on Terror ourselves? And I’ll play Commander in Chief for a minute. Here’s rules of engagement. Kill ‘em all.”</li>
<li style="display: none;">We’re a little spoiled in Texas and Arizona and Wyoming and Vermont. Can you be spoiled in Vermont? And Kansas. We’re starting to get something that looks like the Second Amendment in some places, because it doesn’t exist anywhere yet.</li>
<li style="display: none;">That’s the Second Amendment. If you’re 18 and you’re not convicted of a felony or a violent crime you get to keep and you get to bear 24/7/365 anywhere you damn well please.</li>
<li style="display: none;">My name’s Ted Nugent. I’m 66 years old and I’ve never been in a gun-free zone.       Ever.</li>
<li style="display: none;">I cannot comprehend the soullessness of unarmed and helpless.</li>
<li style="display: none;">So the community scammer [President Barack Obama] didn’t get to be the Commander in Chief because he’s clever. [Democratic presidential candidate] Hillary Clinton, [National Security Advisor] Susan Rice and [IRS employee] Lois Lerner aren’t in jail yet because they’re sneaky. They commit their crimes in the wide open and We The People have failed to arrest them yet.</li>
<li style="display: none;">Whatever we want is always the right thing.</li>
<li style="display: none;">Here’s the only gun law we need: Don’t shoot the wrong guy.</li>
<li style="display: none;">Back when Richard Pryor’s afro caught on fire, I knew I was on the mountaintop of comedy … But thank God the liberal media has actually gotten funnier than Richard Pryor’s afro igniting.</li>
<li style="display: none;">Don’t back away from the storm. Look for the storm. Put your head down and walk proudly right into the storm. Let the wimps and the French back away. You just keep plowing forward, the higher the drifts, the worse the wind, the more wolves, kill ‘em all.</li>
<li style="display: none;">Go forth into that quiet night and let our government know we want separation of powers. Tell them to be the watchdogs our Founding Fathers wanted them to be, not to be a united force against the citizens. So take this good [guns] and use it against the bad and the ugly. It’s a target rich environment. If it was duck season, there’d be so many ducks, you could just close your eyes and shoot ‘em. Don’t close your eyes and don’t shoot just yet, but plow forward and demand accountability … So now let’s take all that good and crush the bad and the ugly, when we identify the gun-grabbers and freedom-haters.</li>
<li style="display: none;">If your child is dying, and there’s only one way to get to the doctor, would you get on [Senate Minority Leader] Harry Reid’s boat to get there? Then your child’s dead. I’d get on the boat, get there, and then I’d shoot him.</li>

<li style="display: none;">“I was in a helicopter in Northern Texas in April with my M4 machinegun killing 169 pigs and 11 coyotes in one morning.”</li>
<li style="display: none;">Nugent complained about a perceived liberal slant in the music press by comparing himself to “a black Jew at a Nazi-Klan rally.” </li>
<li style="display: none;">Throughout the interview, Nugent burped President Barack Obama’s name saying, “That’s the only decent use of toxic gas by the way.  Stating the President’s name.”  </li>

<li style="display: none;">“So when you’re on these kind of mind-altering drugs and you’re mentally ill to think that animals can have rights like human beings do, you can also succumb to the criminal urges and the subhuman anti-life urges of murderers.”  </li>
<li style="display: none;">“If a person can think that an animal has rights, then they can think that a human doesn’t have any rights.  And we have to watch out for these people and if necessary neutralize them.”</li>
<li style="display: none;">Nugent called President Barack Obama “a community organizer gangster from Chicago” and his administration the “Mao Zedong Fan Club.”  </li>
<li style="display: none;">“There are plenty of whales … Tell [environmental activist] Paul [Watson] that I’m gonna’ go whale hunting this year.

Nugent added his own message to the meme, which read: “<a href="https://www.facebook.com/tednugent/photos/a.415262022296.178371.124016042296/10153470914987297/">Know these punks.

Know them well. Tell every1 you know how evil they are. Let us raise maximum hell to shut them down! <em class="blue">[2]</em></a>”

The Anti-Defamation League (ADL) responded within hours, describing Nugent’s post as “conspiratorial anti-Semitism.” “<a href="http://www.adl.org/press-center/press-releases/anti-semitism-usa/adl-calls-on-ted-nugent-to-remove-facebook-post-targeting-prominent-jews-supporting-gun-control.html">Regardless of one’s views on gun control, this kind of scapegoating of an entire religious group is completely unacceptable and completely divorced from reality <em class="blue">[3]</em></a>,” wrote ADL president Jonathan Greenblatt. “<a href="http://www.adl.org/press-center/press-releases/anti-semitism-usa/adl-calls-on-ted-nugent-to-remove-facebook-post-targeting-prominent-jews-supporting-gun-control.html">Nugent should be ashamed for promoting anti-Semitic content, and we hope that good people on both sides of the gun control debate will reject his tactics and his message. We hope that Nugent will have the good sense to remove this share immediately so that it does not spread virally across the internet <em class="blue">[4]</em></a>.”
Nugent responded by posting twice more on the subject that day. In his second post, Nugent wrote “<a href="https://www.facebook.com/tednugent/posts/10153471495187297">Jews for guncontrol are nazis in disguise <em class="blue">[5]</em></a>” and described critics of his first post as “<a href="https://www.facebook.com/tednugent/posts/10153471495187297">superFreaks <em class="blue">[6]</em></a>” and “<a href="https://www.facebook.com/tednugent/posts/10153471495187297">racist prejudiced POS <em class="blue">[7]</em></a>.” “<a href="https://www.facebook.com/tednugent/posts/10153471495187297">I adjust my yamika at my barmitzva playing my kosher guitar <em class="blue">[8]</em></a>,” he added.

In this third post, Nugent shared a meme with a photo of Nazis subjugating Jews during the time of the Holocaust.

In response to the video and firing of Spring Valley High School officer Ben Fields, Nugent wrote the following, <a href="http://www.wnd.com/2015/10/that-high-school-brat-had-it-coming/">“By all accounts, the brat, like so many undisciplined brats before her, simply refused to obey the rules, refused to obey the teacher, refused to obey the principal and refused to obey officer Fields… Finally, somebody did the right thing and gave the poor child a dose of reality that will probably save her life, unless she is let off again. Political correctness still reigns supreme, and a guy that did the right thing has been fired.

<ul>
<li style="display: none;">“Look at this audience. Couldn’t we end the War on Terror ourselves? And I’ll play Commander in Chief for a minute. Here’s rules of engagement. Kill ‘em all.”</li>
<li style="display: none;">We’re a little spoiled in Texas and Arizona and Wyoming and Vermont. Can you be spoiled in Vermont? And Kansas. We’re starting to get something that looks like the Second Amendment in some places, because it doesn’t exist anywhere yet.</li>
<li style="display: none;">That’s the Second Amendment. If you’re 18 and you’re not convicted of a felony or a violent crime you get to keep and you get to bear 24/7/365 anywhere you damn well please.</li>
<li style="display: none;">My name’s Ted Nugent. I’m 66 years old and I’ve never been in a gun-free zone.       Ever.</li>
<li style="display: none;">I cannot comprehend the soullessness of unarmed and helpless.</li>
<li style="display: none;">So the community scammer [President Barack Obama] didn’t get to be the Commander in Chief because he’s clever. [Democratic presidential candidate] Hillary Clinton, [National Security Advisor] Susan Rice and [IRS employee] Lois Lerner aren’t in jail yet because they’re sneaky. They commit their crimes in the wide open and We The People have failed to arrest them yet.</li>
<li style="display: none;">Whatever we want is always the right thing.</li>
<li style="display: none;">Here’s the only gun law we need: Don’t shoot the wrong guy.</li>
<li style="display: none;">Back when Richard Pryor’s afro caught on fire, I knew I was on the mountaintop of comedy … But thank God the liberal media has actually gotten funnier than Richard Pryor’s afro igniting.</li>
<li style="display: none;">Don’t back away from the storm. Look for the storm. Put your head down and walk proudly right into the storm. Let the wimps and the French back away. You just keep plowing forward, the higher the drifts, the worse the wind, the more wolves, kill ‘em all.</li>
<li style="display: none;">Go forth into that quiet night and let our government know we want separation of powers. Tell them to be the watchdogs our Founding Fathers wanted them to be, not to be a united force against the citizens. So take this good [guns] and use it against the bad and the ugly. It’s a target rich environment. If it was duck season, there’d be so many ducks, you could just close your eyes and shoot ‘em. Don’t close your eyes and don’t shoot just yet, but plow forward and demand accountability … So now let’s take all that good and crush the bad and the ugly, when we identify the gun-grabbers and freedom-haters.</li>
<li style="display: none;">If your child is dying, and there’s only one way to get to the doctor, would you get on [Senate Minority Leader] Harry Reid’s boat to get there? Then your child’s dead. I’d get on the boat, get there, and then I’d shoot him.</li>

Cosby said that the race of Trayvon Martin was less important than the fact that the neighborhood watch volunteer who killed him was carrying a gun.

Race does, however, play a significant role in the percentage of black Americans who are killed and wounded every single day in America. The overwhelming majority of blacks are slaughtered by other black hoodlums, the overwhelming majority of whom are involved in gangs and drugs—you know, that ‘victimless crime’ thing <em class="blue">[7]</em></a>.” </p></div><p class="fRight clearfix tRight">Sources <a href="http://www.newsmax.com/TedNugent/Bill-Cosby-Trayvon-Zimmerman/2012/06/15/id/442488" target="_blank">[1]</a> <a href="

<ul>
<li style="display: none;">Nugent was first asked to respond to a Department of Justice investigation into allegedly unconstitutional and discriminatory practices employed by anti-immigrant hardliner and Maricopa County, Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio.  “<a href="http://www.kfyi.com/player/?mid=21974170" target="_blank">Well it’s an ongoing manifestation of a government out of control.  And there is no better warrior, there is no better American hero, to stand up against Fedzilla than the greatest sheriff in the world, Sherriff Joe Arpaio.  I would like to take this opportunity if I might, Mike, because you’re bringing up an important global story that’s coming right out of Phoenix.  So I want to establish my absolute heart and soul support for Sherriff Joe and all the heroes of the Maricopa County Sherriff Department <em class="blue">[1]</em></a>.”</li>
<li style="display: none;">Nugent then turned to his appearance the previous night on CNN’s “Piers Morgan Tonight,” where he discussed the killing of unarmed 17-year-old Trayvon Martin by neighborhood watch “captain” George Zimmerman in Sanford, Florida, stating, “<a href="http://www.kfyi.com/player/?mid=21974170" target="_blank">[Piers Morgan] attempted to get me on the gun issue but I let him have it.  I kept it civil and I let him know that the Trayvon Martin/George Zimmerman situation is anything but what most of the media was attempting to depict it as.  We should be ashamed of ourselves that our media in the United States of America is convicting this man.  Convicting him of quote ‘cold-blooded murder’ when the facts are still not in <em class="blue">[2]</em></a>.”  He went on to <a href="http://www.lonang.com/exlibris/blackstone/bla-416.htm" target="_blank">falsely characterize <em class="blue">[3]</em></a> English Common Law, saying, “<a href="http://www.kfyi.com/player/?mid=21974170" target="_blank">Piers Morgan tried to relate the English law would have not stood for George Zimmerman defending himself.  And I had to clarify to the CNN viewing public that in England, by law, if someone breaks into your house, you have to retreat like a cowardly sheep out the back door, Mike.  People listening right now to you and I on KYFI might not believe this, but in England if someone breaks into your house you have a lawful duty to get out of it.  To escape.  To not defend yourself.  To not defend your home.  That’s anti- human, its absolutely repulsive, and it encourages crime <em class="blue">[4]</em></a>.”  Nugent was then asked to address the racial implications of the Trayvon Martin incident (Martin is African-American while Zimmerman is Caucasian/Hispanic) leading him to respond, “<a href="http://www.kfyi.com/player/?mid=21974170" target="_blank">[Piers Morgan] is convinced that the vast majority of Americans want this guy [George Zimmerman] arrested and convicted.  And I cleared him up on my intro.  I said Piers, ‘The vast majority of Americans do not want this guy arrested and convicted.  The vast majority of Americans are like the Nugent family.  Were not only praying for Trayvon Martin’s family and George Zimmerman’s family, but were still busy praying for the families of the ten black children slaughtered in Chicago on the same weekend that Trayvon Martin was killed.’  Forty-nine shootings in Chicago that weekend.  Ten dead.  But according to Jesse Jackson and Al ‘Not So’ Sharpton and all these left-wing Marxist media pundits, that all those dead black kids don’t matter because they were killed by black people.  The only black life that matters to Al Sharpton is when a black person is killed by maybe, not a Hispanic, but a white Hispanic … Nobody cares about race.  There’s only a handful of nutcases like Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson that care about race.  The rest of us value human life regardless of the color <em class="blue">[5]</em></a>.”  In a March 24-25, 2012 CNN poll, <a href="http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0312/74486.html" target="_blank">73% of Americans <em class="blue">[6]</em></a> said that George Zimmerman should be arrested.  </li>

Nugent wrote that the “<a href="http://www.wnd.com/2015/06/respect-wildlife-or-expect-sudden-death/">real tragedy <em class="blue">[1]</em></a>” was “<a href="http://www.wnd.com/2015/06/respect-wildlife-or-expect-sudden-death/">how so many modern-day dumbed down, disconnected people fail to respect these creatures for the wild, dangerous beasts that they are, and such disrespectful, foolish people will keep getting themselves killed in the process. <em class="blue">[2]</em></a>” Nugent then bragged about his own encounters with wildlife and how he dealt with them, writing, “<a href="http://www.wnd.com/2015/06/respect-wildlife-or-expect-sudden-death/">I had an African lion cross my path in the Sudan back in 1978. He didn’t attack me because I killed him. A grizzly bear came very close to me once with no problem at all, because I killed it. An enraged wild boar charged me in the forest, so I shot it with my bow and arrow, killed it and ate it. One time in Alaska a very large black bear stood on its hind legs only 10 feet away, so I killed him with my .44 magnum, ate the meat and made a beautiful rug. A shark circled my in the Keys one time, so I put an arrow through its heart, ate it and had it mounted. In my 66 years as a natural hunter, I’ve had too many encounters with large, wild animals to count, but never had a problem with any of them. My encounters were natural, real-world encounters as predator and prey, hunter and hunted, the way God intended it. Chimps and lions, cheetahs and cougars, deer and other wild animals are not pets. If you disrespect wildlife enough to reduce them to pets, you are asking for trouble. And if you drive through a wild animal park with your windows rolled down in defiance of ubiquitous, common-sense rules and regulations, you have a very good chance of being attacked and dying.

It’s a dirty lie … If I could impress upon and inspire and beg everyone listening now, we got to reach out to every black person we know and encounter. We have to pray for black America and beg our fellow Americans who are black to admit to this suicidal, self-inflicted curse that you've bought into the big lie of Jesse Jackson and Eric Holder and Al Sharpton, that you're not helpless, you're not a slave, you're not worthless, you're not inept, you can do anything you want to do to get out of the self-inflicted shackles that have been brought upon the race baiters and the racist industry … The food stamp scam.

There was no oppression … They might have run into racism occasionally like I did because I had long hair ...  and by the 70s … Nothing of consequence existed to deter or compromise a black American’s dream if they got an alarm clock, if they set it, if they took good care of themselves, they remained clean and sober, if they spoke clearly, and they demanded excellence of themselves and provided excellence to their employers. <em class="blue">[3]</em></a>” </p></div><p class="fRight clearfix tRight">Sources <a href="http://mediamatters.org/blog/2013/07/17/nugent-the-black-problem-could-be-solved-if-bla/194927" target="_blank">[1]</a> <a href="

I implore you to recommend that Congress pass a law to ban gun-free zones immediately … I encourage you also to keep this misnamed ‘gun violence’ in perspective.

Gabrielle Giffords was holding a ‘meet and greet’ with constituents was an unfathomable act of barbarism … The obviously guilty mass murderer has pleaded guilty and has been spared the death penalty.  Yet the death penalty is exactly what he deserves.  For his crimes, he will spend the rest of his life in prison while six innocent Americans are dead and 13 more are struggling to recover from their wounds.  Sparing the killer’s life is not justice, it’s legalized barbarism.  Allowing him to live out his days in prison is our convoluted legal system allowing Lady Justice to be mugged again and again … If a killer is deemed to be psychotic, he is held to a different standard by our legal system than a killer who is deemed not to be crazy.  That’s a legal system that is certifiably nuts … Locking up the terminal whack-job shooters in prison for the remainder of their lives will cost taxpayers many millions of wasted dollars when all that is required is a 25-cent bullet to the back of their deranged heads.  But the do-gooders among us say we shouldn’t do that, that the state shouldn’t sanction ‘murder,’ especially of those who are deemed to be mentally incompetent.  Do-gooders are more dangerous than a sow grizzly with cubs or a coiled rattlesnake, as do-gooders champion and sanction legalized barbarism … The McNaughton rule, which basically states that terminal whack jobs can’t be held responsible for their crimes, is the ultimate definition of nuts.  It should be replaced with the McNugent rule, which states that regardless of your mental state, if you slaughter innocent people, expect a bullet to the back of the head, most preferably at the scene of the crime.  So long as the American justice system is held hostage by mindless do-gooders who wish to enforce their toxic, brain-dead legalized barbarism on the rest of us, our only recourse is to be vigilant and ready to protect ourselves and our loved ones from these psychotic monsters.  Shoot them.

Holmes wore full body armor during the attack.  </p></div><p class="fRight clearfix tRight">Sources <a href="https://twitter.com/TedNugent/status/228360825683992576" target="_blank">[1]</a></p></li><li class="inner_topic clearfix" style="display: none;"><div class="categories" title="other"><strong>Other Statements</strong></div><div class="state_text"><p>In a July 26, 2012 interview with conservative radio host Glenn Beck, Nugent spoke about a mass shooting that had occurred at a movie theater in Aurora, Colorado six days earlier.  In that shooting, severely mentally ill gunman James Holmes killed 12 people and wounded 58 others.  Holmes wore full body armor during the attack.  Nugent commented to Beck, “<a href="http://mediamatters.org/blog/2012/07/26/nugent-doubles-down-claims-aurora-shooter-could/187343" target="blank">And remember, Glenn, this monster in Aurora took 20 minutes to do his evil.  In 20 minutes you don't need an assault weapon, you don't need a machine gun, which he didn't have either of, but you could do more damage with a single shot or a bolt action because he had 20 minutes … His AR-15 Smith &amp; Wesson rifle is now the most popular sporting rifle in America.  It is the number one competition, number one in self-defense; it's the number one sporting rifle for big game and small game.  And if they keep calling it an ‘assault weapon,’ I may have that aneurysm <em class="blue">[1]</em></a>.”  In fact, the shooting in Aurora lasted only two minutes, after which time Holmes was apprehended by police in the parking lot of the theater.  Single shot rifles and bolt action rifles, which Nugent made reference to, must be reloaded manually after each shot is fired.  A semiautomatic firearm reloads automatically and can keep firing until its magazine is emptied.  Holmes had three semiautomatic firearms on the night of the Aurora shooting, including an AR-15 style rifle (the civilian version of the military’s M-16 rifle) equipped with a 100-round drum magazine.  Paul A. Smith, outdoors editor for the <i>Milwaukee Journal Sentinel</i>, has stated that while AR-15s "<a href="http://mediamatters.org/blog/2012/07/26/nugent-doubles-down-claims-aurora-shooter-could/187343" target="blank">have gained favor among some hunters and sport shooters in recent decades, they constitute a small fraction of deer hunting rifles in use today <em class="blue">[2]</em></a>." </p>
<p>Finally, Nugent compared target shooting to the scenario that an armed citizen might have encountered had he/she attempted to return fire against Holmes in the theater:  “<a href="http://mediamatters.org/blog/2012/07/26/nugent-doubles-down-claims-aurora-shooter-could/187343" target="blank">I know the hysteria about tear gas and it was dark in the theater.  Glenn, I am not making this up.  Last week my wife Shemane and I were filming a segment for our Spirit of the Wild show and we were shooting at watermelons surrounded by human silhouette targets just as kind of a competition and from 20 feet and from 20 yards and we were shooting from every imaginable angle, under cover, from sitting, from squatting, from prone position, from behind cover and from in the open, and we never hit an innocent and we never missed the watermelon.  And I'm just a guitar player.  If a guitar player can neutralize a watermelon from 20 feet—and this is with live fire, by the way.  We would shoot while the other would take the target shots.  So there was that tension of live fire.  And this was done in a scenario—and I understand it wasn't real bullets coming at us and it wasn't people screaming, running around … But dear God in heaven, doing nothing is not an option.  Training, having a firearm to neutralize an evil gun maniac is a way to go, and we train for that.  And I wish I would have been in the theater that day <em class="blue">[3]</em></a>.” </p></div><p class="fRight clearfix tRight">Sources <a href="http://mediamatters.org/blog/2012/07/26/nugent-doubles-down-claims-aurora-shooter-could/187343" target="_blank">[1]</a> <a href="

I also do not want to try this on television.  I think we both agree that there is a tragedy that it is being tried and that Zimmerman has been convicted across the media in many instances.  So let’s not do this here.  So let me propose to you a scenario that I think you can grasp and support.  You must be aware, and if not ill inform you now, how many professional law enforcement heroes are killed every year with their own weapon.  I’m not juxtaposing this with the Trayvon and the Zimmerman situation, but it does happen where an assaultant will start beating a person so badly that those of us that are armed, we have a responsibility to keep that new assault from taking our weapon.  Because if the assault escalates to that degree, certainly the fist can go into a deadly situation if they get ahold of the gun bearer’s gun.  So we have to be cognizant of that.  If it wasn’t for backup guns in law enforcement and in civilian hands oftentimes, that the perpetrator and the person getting beat up is killed with his own gun.  So let’s not dismiss that reality that is documented over and over again across this country <em class="blue">[1]</em></a>,” stated Nugent.  Morgan then asked him, “<a href="http://piersmorgan.blogs.cnn.com/2012/04/05/clips-from-last-night-ted-nugent-on-trayvon-martin-stedman-graham-on-identity-and-ownership/" target="_blank">Do you believe that a neighborhood watch official acting in that capacity should be armed and using that firearm? <em class="blue">[2]</em></a>” to which he responded, “<a href="http://piersmorgan.blogs.cnn.com/2012/04/05/clips-from-last-night-ted-nugent-on-trayvon-martin-stedman-graham-on-identity-and-ownership/" target="_blank">Yes <em class="blue">[3]</em></a>.”  In a March 24-25, 2012 CNN poll, <a href="http://articles.cnn.com/2012-03-26/justice/justice_florida-teen-shooting-poll_1_gun-laws-shooting-death-grand-jury?_s=PM:JUSTICE" target="_blank">three-quarters of Americans <em class="blue">[4]</em></a> said that neighborhood watch volunteers should not be armed.  </p></div><p class="fRight clearfix tRight">Sources <a href="http://piersmorgan.blogs.cnn.com/2012/04/05/clips-from-last-night-ted-nugent-on-trayvon-martin-stedman-graham-on-identity-and-ownership/" target="_blank">[1]</a> <a href="

Do you think I was gonna’ lay down my guitar and go play army?  Give me a break!  I was busy doin’ it to it … I got my physical notice thirty days prior to.  Well, on that day I ceased cleansing my body.  No more brushing my teeth, no more washing my hair, no baths, no soap, no water.  Thirty days of debris build.  I stopped shavin’ and I was 18, had a little scraggly beard, really looked like a hippie.  I had long hair, and it started gettin’ kinky, matted up.  Then two weeks before, I stopped eating any food with nutritional value … Then a week before, I stopped going to the bathroom.  I did it in my pants. poop, piss the whole shot.  My pants got crusted up.  See, I approached the whole thing like, Ted Nugent, cool hard-workin’ dude, is gonna wreak havoc on these imbeciles in the armed forces.  I’m gonna’ play their own game, and I’m gonna’ destroy ‘em.  Now my whole body is crusted in poop and piss.  I was ill.  And three or four days before, I started stayin’ awake.  I was close to death, but I was in control.  I was extremely anti-drug as I’ve always been, but I snorted some crystal methedrine.  Talk about one wounded mother *****.  A guy put up four lines, and it was for all four of us, but I didn’t know and I’m vacuuming that poop right up.  I was a walking, talking hunk of human poop.  I was six-foot-three of sin.  So the guys took me down to the physical, and my nerves, my emotions were distraught.  I was not a good person … So I went in, and those guys in uniform couldn’t believe the smell.  They were ridiculin’ me and pushin’ me around and I was cryin’, but all the time I was laughin’ to myself.  When they stuck the needle in my arm for the blood test I passed out, and when I came to they were kicking me into the wall.  Then they made everybody take off their pants, and I did, and this sergeant says, ‘Oh my God, put those back on!  You *****’ swine, you!’  Then they had a urine test and I couldn’t piss, but my poop was just like ooze, man, so I poop in the cup and put it on the counter.  I had poop on my hand and my arm.  The guy almost puked.  I was so proud. I knew I had these chumps beat.  The last thing I remember was wakin’ up in the ear test booth and they were sweepin’ up.  So I went home and cleaned up.  They took a putty knife to me.  I got the street rats out of my hair, ate some good steaks, beans, potatoes, cottage cheese, milk.  A couple of days and I was ready to kick ass.  And in the mail I got this big juicy 4-F.  They’d call dead people before they’d call my ass.  But you know the funny thing about it?  I’d make an incredible army man.  I’d be a colonel before you knew what hit you, and I’d have the baddest bunch of motherfuckin’ killers you’d ever seen in my platoon.  But I just wasn’t into it.  I was too busy doin’ my own thing, you know? <em class="blue">[1]</em></a>”  A Selective Service form that chronicles Nugent’s draft history can be viewed <a href="http://www.newshounds.us/2007/08/26/proof_ted_nugent_is_a_draft_dodger_will_hannity_keep_defending_him.php" target="_blank">here <em class="blue">[2]</em></a>.</p></div><p class="fRight clearfix tRight">Sources <a href="http://forum.surfermag.com/forum/printthread.php?Board=wwatch&amp;main=2057074&amp;type=post" target="_blank">[1]</a> <a href="

Once they get off welfare and are self-sustaining, they get their right to vote restored.  No American on welfare should have the right to vote for tax increases on those Americans who are working and paying taxes to support them … We also need to get our voting system straightened out and eliminate voter fraud.

Instead of tightening Fedzilla’s fiscal belt, government bureaucrats just buy him bigger belts and suspenders, and he gets fatter and smellier each day.  The only good pig is a dead pig.  Regrettably, there are way too many intellectually stunted Americans who support this gluttonous and irresponsible spending curse.  They are called socialists.  Socialists believe in Keynesian economics, which supports government control and meddling in our economy … It’s akin to Jerry Sandusky managing a little boys’ football team. Another, more accurate name for Keynesian economics is Kamikaze economics <em class="blue">[1]</em></a>.”  Keynesian economics are based on the ideas of 20th century economist John Maynard Keynes.  Advocates of Keynesian economics argue that private sector decisions sometimes lead to inefficient macroeconomic outcomes which require active policy responses by the public sector.  Nugent also made reference to Jerry Sandusky, a former assistant football coach at Penn State University who was convicted of sexually abusing ten boys during a 15-year period.  Finally, Nugent described fellow <a href="http://meetthenra.org/nra-member/Grover Norquist" target="blank">NRA board member Grover Norquist <em class="blue">[2]</em></a> as “The Dirty Harry of tax and government reform.”  “<a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2012/jul/26/grover-norquist-beltways-clint-eastwood/" target="blank">Dirty Harry Norquist, president of Americans For Tax Reform, has never seen a tax increase he supports <em class="blue">[3]</em></a>,” wrote Nugent, “<a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2012/jul/26/grover-norquist-beltways-clint-eastwood/" target="blank">which should immediately put him at the head of the line for a Presidential Medal of Freedom once Mitt Romney is elected.  If there was a Hall of Fame of Common Sense, a huge statue of Grover Norquist would at be the front door <em class="blue">[4]</em></a>.” ATR’s “Taxpayer Protection Pledge” calls on lawmakers to swear to never vote for any legislation that would raises taxes, no matter how modestly.  </p></div><p class="fRight clearfix tRight">Sources <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2012/jul/26/grover-norquist-beltways-clint-eastwood/" target="_blank">[1]</a> <a href="

That may be ugly and uncomfortable to the soulless, politically correct masters of denial, but it’s the truth nonetheless.  Being poor is largely a choice, a daily, if not hourly, decision … We need to punish poor decisions instead of rewarding them.  We cannot continue to offer a safety blanket to those Americans who make poor choices.  The fewer social welfare programs, the better.  This, too, may be ugly and uncomfortable, but we must make hard choices that force people into making smart, responsible decisions … Our schools need to be dramatically restructured.  I advocate that our kids go to school year-round from 8 a.m. until 5 p.m.  We need to make it easier to fire poor teachers and reward good ones and bust up the National Education Association [union] … If you can’t afford to have kids, quit having them and expecting the taxpayers to pay for them.  Men and women with no visible means of support other than the taxpayer dime shouldn’t be having children.  That may sound ugly and controlling, but it’s much uglier to expect the taxpayer to pay for mindless baby-making machines, which guarantees the cycle of poverty <em class="blue">[1]</em></a>.” </p></div><p class="fRight clearfix tRight">Sources <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2011/dec/16/poor-parental-choices-make-poor-children/" target="_blank">[1]</a></p></li><li class="inner_topic clearfix" style="display: none;"><div class="categories" title="labor"><strong>Labor</strong></div><div class="state_text"><p>In a September 2, 2011 op-ed for the <i>Washington Times</i>, Nugent wrote, “<a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2011/sep/2/laborious-day-2011/" target="_blank">[AFL-CIO President Richard] Trumka knows that much of the trillion-dollar stimulus package is nothing more than President Obama using our tax dollars to provide artificial employment for union workers.

<li style="display: none;">When asked if his fellow NRA board members think that he goes too far in his public comments, Nugent said, “Most of them.  I say that I want the rape victim to shoot the rapist.  They agree with me privately. They think stating this publicly is bad PR. They're wrong.” </li>

The problem has gotten much worse after spending over $16 trillion since 1965 on so-called poverty programs <em class="blue">[3]</em></a>.” President Lyndon Johnson’s “Great Society” initiative was responsible for the creation of Medicare and Medicaid, and a variety of other anti-poverty programs. These programs, according to a 2012 study published by Brookings Institute, helped reduced the poverty by 26.4% from 1960 to 2000.</div><p class="fRight clearfix tRight">Sources <a href="http://www.wnd.com/2014/08/ferguson-and-lbjs-war-on-blacks/" target="_blank">[1]</a></p></li></ul>
