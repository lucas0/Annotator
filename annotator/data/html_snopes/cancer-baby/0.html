I wanted to know how many vaccines Malaysian children are taking nowadays, and I couldn’t find a number anywhere, so I sat down to do a count. What I discovered astounded me—we are on par with the USA! And that’s not something to be proud of.<br/>
<br/>
Here is a <a href="http://search.moh.gov.my/i/cache?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dph.gov.my%2Fcdc%2Fvaccine%2520preventable%2520disease%2520unit%2Fimmunization%2520program%2Fchilhood.htm&amp;keyword=vaccine+schedule&amp;s=MOH-1254717464386" target="_blank">list of compulsory vaccines</a> as dictated by the Ministry of Health of Malaysia. According to them, “The schedule is compulsory although it is not strictly enforced or enforceable policy.” (<a href="http://www.nst.com.my/life-times/health/that-shot-at-prevention-1.77017" target="_blank">Source</a>) And no, your child does not need to be vaxed to enter school. You just need to show them your child’s vaccination record for record-keeping purposes. It is not a requirement to receive education.<br/>

<br/>
Here is a <a href="http://www.mpaweb.org.my/article.php?aid=30" target="_blank">list of recommended plus optional vaccines</a> by the Ministry of Health.<br/>
<br/>
Wow, so many!!<br/>
<br/>
So before you vaccinate, do you know exactly what vaccines you are giving your child? Do you know what is contained in them? Do you know if these vaccines are necessary? Do you know what the negative side effects are? Do you know how many children suffer from negative side effects? Do you know if your child is at risk for experiencing a negative side effect? Have you decided if the possible harm from the vaccine is worse than getting the disease? Or is getting the disease is worse than the possible harm? Are you gambling with your child’s life with full knowledge of all the pros and cons? Or are you just blindly going along? Did your doctor inform you or all the pros and cons before jabbing? Did he or you read the list of ingredients and negative side effects written by the manufacturer in the insert of the vaccine box?<br/>
<br/>
Well, here are a few things you need to know before you decide. Whatever your decision, always gamble with a full deck. Know what you are getting. It’s your child’s life you are gambling with.<br/>
<br/>
Here are the vaccines your child is getting, what they are for, and what is contained in them.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<u><b>1 day old</b></u><br/>
<br/>
<b>1. Hepatitis B</b><br/>
<br/>
Hepatitis B is transmitted primarily through sexual fluids and blood, which means having unprotected sex with infected persons (easily avoided with a condom) and sharing syringes previously used by infected people, usually to inject drugs (easily avoided by giving your baby some clean needles). Blood used in blood transfusions is screened for Hep B, so no problem there.<br/>
<br/>
Immunity to vaccine viruses lasts an average of 2-3 years. Is your child going to have sex and share needles with infected drug users at this age? So why give this to a 1-day-old baby?<br/>
<br/>
“Some years ago, at a public meeting in Louisiana, Dr. Neal Halsey, one of the architects [of the US vaccination policy] was confronted with the question, “Why give a vaccine for a disease that is transmitted by intravenous drug abuse and high-risk sexual practices to one-day-old babies?” According to the parent, his answer was, “Because we can.” ” (<a href="http://academicintegrityfund.com/2012/10/29/maternal-instinct/">Source.</a>)<br/>
<br/>
Why? Because all six members of the vaccine approval committee in the CDC are shareholders of pharmaceutical companies that sell vaccines. (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0312326459/ref=as_li_tf_til?tag=healbite-20&amp;camp=0&amp;creative=0&amp;linkCode=as1&amp;creativeASIN=0312326459&amp;adid=188TACQ1C777EY04PWY7&amp;">Source</a>)<br/>
<br/>
Hep B vaccine ingredients:<br/>
Hep B (Engerix-B): Aluminum hydroxide, yeast protein, phosphate buffers, sodium dihydrogen phosphate dihydrate.<br/>
Hep B (Recombivax): Yeast protein, soy peptone [here’s your first dose of soy allergy], dextrose, amino acids, mineral salts, potassium aluminum sulfate, amorphous aluminum hydroxyphosphate sulfate, formaldehyde, phosphate buffer.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<b>Vitamin K</b><br/>
<br/>
Vitamin K is not a vaccine but it is usually given as soon as the baby comes out the hatch. Vit K helps the blood to clot. Babies produce only 30-60% of Vitamin K levels of that of an adult. Premature babies have even lower levels. In very rare events, babies can experience internal bleeding. (I wonder if this has to do with brutal modern birthing methods.) So it was made standard practice to give baby a shot of synthetic Vit K to prevent haemorrhaging, and also to help the blood clot should the parents want to perform elective surgery (genital mutilation) right away before the baby can produce enough Vit K of his own. The amount of synthetic Vit K given in the shot results in the blood becoming 1,000 times thicker than an adult’s (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/4051538">Source</a>).<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Alcohol and aluminum? Is your baby’s liver all fully up and running 5 minutes after he is born? If the liver is overtaxed, then jaundice is the result.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<b>2. Tuberculosis (BCG vaccine)</b><br/>
<br/>
Newborns have no immune system. 90% of your immune system lies in your gut. Immunity comes from the beneficial bacteria that live in your intestines. Good bacteria and antibodies are acquired from mother’s milk and food, and are cultivated over time. What happens when you give vaccines to a child who cannot create antibodies to the virus? One of two possibilities: 1) Nothing - no antibodies are created and he gets all the toxic additives for nothing, or 2) The virus wins and he develops the disease.<br/>
<br/>
The BCG vaccine is a live-bacteria vaccine. “It should not be used in infants, children, or adults with severe immune deficiency syndromes. Children with a family history of immune deficiency disease should not be vaccinated.” (<a href="http://www.drugs.com/pro/bcg-vaccine.html" target="_blank">Source: FDA</a>)<br/>
<br/>
I’m sure your doctor already did a genetic test for immune deficiency syndromes prior giving your newborn this vaccine, right?<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and giving it simultaneously with the Hep B vaccine is a total joke. Live-virus vaccines are made thus because it was found that the dead-virus version does not elicit enough of an immune response to be of any use. But, the Hep B vaccine is a dead-virus vaccine, which means they have killed the virus with mercury and formaldehyde. (Don’t forget that whatever kills virus cells kills human cells too.) So now you mix the mercury and formaldehyde in the Hep B vaccine with the live virus in the BCG vaccine and what happens? The live viruses are killed. So you don’t get any benefit at all. Ha ha ha. Your paediatrician is laughing all the way to the bank.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<u><b>1 month old</b></u><br/>
<br/>
<b>3. Hepatitis B #2</b><br/>
<br/>
Because your newborn had no immune system, he did not develop any antibodies to the first shot (surprise surprise), so you jab him again at 2 months. A child’s immune system is only developed around age 2, so guess what is the outcome of giving vaccines at 2 months? Is your child having unprotected sex with infected people already? So why the hurry to give this vaccine so early? Is your doctor afraid you might not come back and he would lose income? Hmm... Well, here are some things to consider if your baby insists on having unprotected sex with infected people: Hepatitis B is just one virus, there are also Hepatitis C, D and E which cause the same disease, which are transmitted the same way, and for which there are no vaccines. HIV too. So why not just teach your infant how to put on a condom and to use his own needle at all times when injecting heroin? Prevention is key! It’s so much safer and cheaper to avoid catching diseases with a condom and a clean needle than a vaccine, don’t you think?<br/>
<br/>
The Hep B vaccine contains:<br/>
<br/>
<i>Yeast.</i> That’s what the viruses were grown in. Yeast is NOT something want growing in your baby’s gut as it will compete with the good bacteria (and win). Lots of good gut bacteria = good immune system. Little  beneficial bacteria = fall sick easily. Weren’t you trying to avoid getting sick in the first place? Also, injecting yeast into the bloodstream will create an allergy to yeast, which usually translates into allergies to many kinds of fungi as well. Allergies to penicillin (penicillin is cultivated in yeast), beer, peanuts (mouldy ones)... a lifetime of scratching!<br/>
<br/>
<i>Antibiotics.</i> Usually neomycin, streptomycin or polymyxin B. All vaccines contain antibiotics to prevent bacteria from growing in the mixture due to repeated jabs into the bottle. Taking antibiotics at any age will wipe out the beneficial bacteria in the gut, which is 90% of your immune system. So if your purpose in vaccinating was to make your child more immune to diseases, sorry, you just did the opposite. Plus, having wiped out all the good bacteria (from Day 1), the yeast that you injected with this dose will have free reign to partyyyy!!!! Now there is no-one else competing for food. Good bacteria can be rebuilt slowly with probiotics, but usually it will never return to its original state because there are thousands of strains of good bacteria, and those sold in stores are fewer than 10 strains. With every dose of antibiotics, your child will become increasingly prone to getting sick more often, and being sick for longer.<br/>
<br/>
Have you seen children with white spots in their mouths that looks like cottage cheese, or a whitish discharge in the underwear? (Not so easy to see on white diapers though.) Digestive problems, inability to sleep through the night, colic, urinary tract infections, ADHD, sugar and carbohydrate cravings? That’s yeast or candida. <a href="http://www.tacanow.org/family-resources/what-is-yeast-overgrowth/">See other symptoms of yeast overgrowth.</a><br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<i>Aluminium.</i> Aluminium is added to vaccines to stimulate the immune system to create inflammation. No vaccine can be made without aluminium (or mercury) as your immune system would not attack the dead viruses that are injected. They would just eat up the dead cells of the viruses and excrete them in your poop. Aluminium makes your body create inflammation so that when your immune system sees the virus particles, it attacks the virus and creates antibodies. Which is great, so now you have immunity. (But, artificially created immunity only lasts 2-3 years.) Aluminium is not easily excreted by the body. As long as it remains in your body, it will stimulate your immune system to create inflammation. But there are no more viruses to attack. So it also attacks all the other foreign proteins that you injected - peanut, soybean, wheatgerm and corn oil, eggs, chicken, cow, pig, horses, mice... Now your child has allergies.<br/>
<br/>
They say that children grow out of allergies. That’s not true. Aging does not reduce disease. Over time, your child’s body excretes the aluminium, and then the severity of the allergies will go down. IF your child does not have a genetic condition that precludes the excretion of heavy metals, that is. But why inject heavy metals in the first place? <br/>
<br/>
<i>Sodium borate.</i> Borax. Rat poison. Do you know why scientists always tests medications on rats? Because their bodies are biologically very similar to ours. So what happens when you inject rat poison into a human baby?<br/>
<br/>
<i>Mercury.</i> The dangers of mercury is far too long to list here. It is the MOST TOXIC basic element found on planet earth. It kills whatever cells it comes into contact with. It is attracted to fat cells, so they stick to the most fatty organs - the brain, liver and kidneys. It is added to vaccines to kill bacteria and to make your immune system create inflammation (same as aluminium). Mercury is the main cause of autism, Alzheimer’s, dyslexia, ADHD, hearing problems, visual problems, memory problems, coordination problems and all kinds of developmental delays. All those are just outward symptoms of brain damage. This short video shows what happens to brain cells when touched by mercury. Watch it. Then you will fully understand the seriousness of mercury.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
More than making you dumb, mercury also suppresses the production of neutrophils (immune cells) that attack yeast, so when mercury is present, yeast grows unchecked. Since you have introduced yeast into the body with this shot... let the party begin! Yeast overgrowth causes digestive problems, depression, bipolar disorder, autism, and most commonly, ADHD. It is common to see food intolerances (indigestion, colic) and inability to sleep even among infants. Mercury also interferes with the production of melatonin, which regulates sleep.<br/>
<br/>
Mercury can also cause ADHD directly by blocking the production of the necessary neurotransmitters and enzymes. Mercury further blocks the production of metallothionein and glutathione, proteins that the body uses to excrete mercury. So like some kind of smart organism, mercury also prevents its own removal. It would make a great bioweapon, don’t you think? Put it in and it disables the system that your body uses to get it out.<br/>
<br/>
Check out the <a href="http://www.fda.gov/Food/ResourcesForYou/HealthEducators/ucm081877.htm">FDA’s mercury warning for pregnant women</a>: “High levels of 
methylmercury can harm an unborn child’s developing nervous system - 
even before conception.” This is the FDA warning for <i>methyl</i> mercury, which is found in fish. <i>Ethyl</i> mercury, which is the form used in vaccines, is MUCH more toxic. So if you should avoid eating mercury long before you become pregnant (because it takes 60 years to excrete), and should avoid taking mercury during pregnancy so that you don’t pass it to your baby via the placenta and he becomes retarded or is
killed outright, then suddenly it’s ok to inject an even more toxic version directly into the same baby minutes after he’s out of the womb? What, was mercury suddenly rendered non-toxic due to the miracle of your child’s birth?<br/>
<br/>
If your child is premature or underweight, then the ratio of toxins to body weight is even higher. That is why <a href="http://www.autismwebsite.com/crimetimes/99b/w99bp6.htm">75% of premature babies suffer from developmental problems</a>, compared to 25% in full-term babies. Which is already pretty bad in itself - that means 1 in 4 children have “learning disabilities, ADHD, language impairment, mild neurological impairment, and general academic problems”, and that was in 1999. Dyslexia is not hereditary. Dyslexia is brain damage. (<i>Update:</i> It is 37% in New Zealand now. That’s 1 in 3. I’ll post the link when I find it again.)<br/>
<br/>
<i>Formaldehyde.</i> Remember when grandpa died and they drained all his blood and injected a few gallons of this pungent-smelling stuff into his arteries? Or the specimens of animals and foetuses floating in jars of this yellowish liquid in your school science lab? Formaldehyde is used to preserve dead bodies. It is added to vaccines to kill the virus and preserve it, otherwise they would just decompose. People are making a lot of noise about the formaldehyde in paint fumes, furniture and car interiors causing cancer, but what about vaccines?<br/>
<br/>
The US government has <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/11/health/11cancer.html?_r=0" target="_blank">declared formaldehyde a cause of cancer</a>. “Salon workers have reported headaches, nosebleeds, burning eyes, vomiting and asthma attacks after using [haircare products containing formaldehyde].”<br/>
<br/>
So what happens when you inject formaldehyde into babies? Vomiting, wheezing and asthma attacks are very common side effects of most vaccines, are they not? Do you think your baby might be having a splitting headache when he cries for days after a vaccination? Your doctor would likely tell you it’s normal for babies to cry non-stop for days. Well, you be the judge. Formaldehyde is added to most, if not all, dead-virus vaccines. What about cancer? People say God is cruel because he gives children cancer. Oh no no no.... it’s not God who asked you to inject cancer-causing toxins into your newborn’s body.<br/>
<br/>
You are probably wondering... So if the FDA has declared it to be a carcinogen, then why does the same FDA still allow it to be added to a product to be injected into a 1-day-old baby? Why didn’t they make pharma recall all their stock? Many parents say, “But surely the government wouldn’t allow something so harmful to be sold to us, right? Cos they’re supposed to protect us, right??” Riiiiiight. Just like cigarettes and liquor. Just like how they declare that cigarettes cause cancer but continue to allow it to be sold. Unfortunately, they don’t require pharma to print gory autopsy pictures of children with cancer on the packaging of vaccines. Cancer strikes 1 in 2 men and 1 in 3 women in the US. (<a href="http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/551998">Source: National Cancer Institute</a>) There are not that many smokers. But there sure are a lot of formaldehyde injectors.<br/>

<br/>
And what if you, the mother, already have Hep B? Then you should breastfeed your baby and pass your antibodies on to your baby and she will naturally have immunity. No additional toxins needed. But breastmilk is not profitable to anyone, is it?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<u><b>2 months old</b></u><br/>
<br/>
<b>DTaP (Diphtheria, Tetanus and Acellular Pertussis)</b><br/>
<br/>
<b>4. Diphtheria</b><br/>
<br/>
Diphtheria is a bacteria that infects the upper respiratory tract. A sore throat and swollen neck glands can cause breathing difficulties. It spreads by droplets, so you should always wash your hands and face before touching your baby or his food. How terrible of a disease is this? In 7 years (2000-2007), there were only 5 reported cases of diphtheria in the entire US of A. No deaths. Diphtheria can be easily treated by the diphtheria antitoxin anyway. So what do you need a vaccine for? Besides, this is a toxoid, which means that the vaccine helps your body to create antibodies to the toxin produced by the bacteria, should you catch diphtheria. In no way does it prevent your child from catching the disease.<br/>
<br/>
The diphtheria vaccine contains aluminium (allergies, brain damage), mercury (brain damage), formaldehyde (cancer) and gelatine (allergies). It also contains polysorbate 80, a detergent/emulsifier that causes cancer and permanent infertility (<a href="http://organichealthadviser.com/archives/polysorbate-80-in-swine-flu-vaccines-infertility-in-humans">see studies here</a>). And you wonder why so many people have fertility problems nowadays. (More business for doctors eh?) It’s just what God dealt you? Oh no, he never asked you to inject polysorbate. But anyway, he did build in a safety net - anyone who indulges in such unbeneficial behaviours will not reproduce to pass on this behaviour to the next generation, otherwise it would mean the extinction of the human race. So go ahead and sterilise your child now. The world is already overpopulated anyway.<br/>
<br/>
Some brands use phenoxyethanol as an alternative to mercury, as it is more efficient at killing bacteria at a lower concentration, without exceeding allowed “safe” levels (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20424565">Source: The toxicity of compounds used as preservatives in vaccines and biologics</a>). Phenoxyethanol is antifreeze. The sort in your car engine. They like to label things with difficult-sounding words so you don’t know what you’re getting and they hope that you’re too lazy to look it up. Antifreeze is added to kill bacteria from repeated jabs into a multi-dose bottle. They don’t want to make single-dose bottles cos that is less cost-efficient. It costs a little more and perhaps you would buy less if it costs more, so best to keep it as cheap as possible, even if it means killing the customer. Classed as “Very Toxic Material” by the manufacturer (<a href="http://www.sciencelab.com/msds.php?msdsId=9926486">Source</a>), antifreeze “may lead to kidney, liver, blood and central nervous system disorders. It is harmful or <b>fatal</b> if swallowed.” But injected? It magically becomes harmless! “Effects include <b>behavioural disorders</b>, drowsiness, vomiting, diarrhoea, visual disturbances, thirst, convulsions, cyanosis [skin turning blue], rapid heart rate, central nervous system stimulation, depression, cardiopulmonary [heartbeat and breathing] effects, kidney disorders and <b>eczema</b>. Produces <b>reproductive defects</b> and <b>developmental problems</b> (got dyslexia?) in experimental animals.”<br/>
<br/>
(Side note: The Vitamin K shot given at 1 day old also contains antifreeze.) <br/>

How many children do you know who have eczema? I think it might be easier to count those who <i>don’t</i> have eczema.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<b>5. Tetanus</b><br/>
<br/>
Tetanus is a bacteria that grows in anaerobic (oxygen-less) conditions. The bacteria is not a problem, it’s the toxin produced by the bacteria that causes a problem. The tetanus bacteria is spread via the faeces of infected animals. If you get a deep puncture or stab wound (like from a pen, knife or cat or dog fangs), and the knife has on it faeces from an infected animal, then the bacteria will happily live in the deepest part of the wound that gets no air. If it should be exposed to air, it will die. If your child should be so unfortunate as to be bitten by a cat with infected poop on its fangs, the best thing to do is to clean and disinfect the wound thoroughly to remove all the bacteria. Clean it with hydrogen peroxide (oxygen) on it. Can’t get to the deepest part? Then lance it and expose it to air.<br/>
<br/>
There is also a tetanus antitoxin called an immunoglobulin. I don’t know if it’s available in Malaysia though. I asked a govt doctor once and she didn’t know what I was talking about. At any rate, you won’t need this if you clean out the wound well.<br/>
<br/>
There is also a rare condition which affects newborns, whereby their umbilical cord gets infected with tetanus. This usually occurs in children who live in mud huts, where people apply animal dung to the baby’s umbilical cord because they believe that it has medicinal properties, or cut the cord with scissors that have been sitting on the earthen floor where diseased animals freely defecate. If this sounds like your house, you’d better stop surfing the net and go clean out your filthy house right now!!<br/>
<br/>
This vaccine contains a toxoid, which is the toxin inactivated by formalin and formaldehyde. When the immune system receives a toxoid, it produces antibodies that block the toxin. This vaccine will not prevent you from catching tetanus.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This vaccine also contains mercury. Mercury is a neurotoxin, which means it destroys brain and nerve cells. At 2 months old, your infant’s liver and kidneys are not functioning at full capacity yet, which means that the mercury will remain in their body much longer and cause more damage. Mercury sticks to fat, hence it is not easily carried out by the blood and urine (water). Whatever is not removed quickly migrates to and stays in the fatty organs – kidneys, liver and brain (in that order). Result: kidney, liver and brain damage. Brain damage manifests as developmental delays, dyslexia, ADHD or autism. Liver and kidney damage won’t show up on blood tests until it is very serious, so even if blood tests are within the normal range, that does not mean that damage has not occurred. What about mercury in the brain? Kid late to walk and talk? Doc told you it’s normal? No, it ain’t normal, but it’s common. It’s common because many children are mercury poisoned these days.<br/>
<br/>
And there’s all that formalin and formaldehyde used to kill the original toxin. Formaldehyde kills everything it touches. How much formaldehyde has your baby had by now?<br/>
<br/>
The vaccine also contains gelatine (from cows or pigs). Now, gelatine is fine for eating, but injecting? Yurk!  Does your child have an allergy to gelatine? Did your doctor test for a gelatine allergy first?<br/>
<br/>
Plus polysorbate 80 - a detergent. Injecting detergents! Now, that’s got to make for an interesting trip. Pity your baby is too young to tell you what a detergent trip is like. Polysorbate also causes cancer and infertility. That’s a good way to ensure your child won’t pass on this unbeneficial practice of injecting detergents. Polysorbate is an emulsifier added to bind the vaccine ingredients into a colloidal suspension instead of having bits sinking to the bottom because you can’t always trust doctors to shake the bottle every time. That’s what detergents do - bind oil with water. Polysorbate is used in many foods like ice-cream and salad dressings to bind fat to water. But eating and injecting are two very, very different things, because your intestine has a mucosal lining to keep toxins from being absorbed into the bloodstream. By injecting toxins directly into your bloodstream, all your body’s protective systems have been bypassed.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<b>6. Pertussis</b><br/>
<br/>
Pertussis is whooping cough caused by a bacteria. This is The Terrible Vaccine that caused a lot of deaths. Not so long ago, it was made with killed whole-cell pertussis bacterium, and combined with live diphtheria virus and tetanus toxoid. This vaccine caused seizures and permanent brain damage in a whole lotta children. In the 90’s, it was withdrawn and reformulated with the acellular pertussis (without the entire cell). This vaccine was less harmful but it was not terribly good at eliciting an immune response (<a href="https://www.aap.org/en-us/about-the-aap/aap-press-room/pages/Whole-Cell-Versus-Vs-Acellular-Pertussis-Vaccine-Affects-Disease-Risk.aspx?nfstatus=401&amp;nftoken=00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000&amp;nfstatusdescription=ERROR:+No+local+token">Source</a>). Now, here’s something even more hilarious - vaccinated people are the ones spreading pertussis!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
“The results of the FDA study [on baboons] found that both types of vaccines generated robust antibody responses in the animals, and none of the vaccinated animals developed outward signs of pertussis disease after being exposed to B. pertussis. However, animals that received an acellular pertussis vaccine had the bacteria in their airways for up to 6 weeks and were able to spread the infection to unvaccinated animals. In contrast, animals that received whole-cell vaccine cleared the bacteria within 3 weeks.<br/>
<br/>
This research suggests that although individuals immunized with an acellular pertussis vaccine may be protected from disease, they may still become infected with the bacteria without always getting sick and ARE ABLE TO SPREAD THE INFECTION TO OTHERS, including young infants who are susceptible to pertussis disease.”<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Pertussis is spread by droplets, so wash your hands before you feed or touch your baby. If you are the one who is vaccinated, wear a mask for 6 weeks so that you don’t spread your germs to your child.<br/>
This vaccine contains aluminium and formaldehyde. These are standard additives to all dead-virus vaccines. Some brands also contain mercury. Ooh, and my favourite – neomycin. Neomycin is an antibiotic. Why do you need antibiotics in a vial of viruses? Because if the manufacturing environment is less than sanitary and should the storage temperature not be maintained at optimum at all times, bacteria can grow in there. Isn’t that great though? You get 2,000 germs for the price of 1! But here’s the deal about neomycin – it interferes with the absorption of Vitamin B6. An error in the uptake of B6 can cause epilepsy. So to all those people whose babies started having seizures after getting jabbed, now you know where it came from. Cos it’s so much cheaper to add an antibiotic to the vaccine than to make the factory assembly line more sanitary. (See: <a href="http://healthbitesonline.blogspot.com/2009/03/merck-gets-warning-letter-from-fda-over_7111.html">Merck gets warning letter from FDA over shoddy manufacturing practices.</a>)<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and then there’s glutaraldehyde. This is another good one. It is an industrial chemical used to disinfect oil pipelines and used as a slimicide in paper manufacturing (slimicides kill slime-producing organisms like bacteria, fungi and algae). (<a href="http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/glutaraldehyde/">Source</a>) So why is this industrial poison added to vaccines? Well, vaccines are produced in factories too, no? And factories get slimy too, so you gotta clean it out. Don’t want contaminants in the vaccine now!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
“Long-term effects: Glutaraldehyde is a sensitizer. This means some workers will become very sensitive to glutaraldehyde and have strong reactions if they are exposed to even small amounts. Workers may get sudden asthma attacks with difficult breathing, wheezing, coughing, and tightness in the chest. Prolonged exposure can cause a skin allergy and chronic eczema, and afterwards, exposure to small amounts produces severe itching and skin rashes.” (<a href="https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/etools/hospital/hazards/glutaraldehyde/glut.html">Source</a>)</blockquote>
So many children nowadays with allergies, asthma and eczema. Gee, I wonder where that came from. It’s just your bad genes, your doctor says.<br/>

<b>7. HIB (Haemophilus Influenza B)</b><br/>
<br/>
HIB is a bacteria that causes meningitis. It is transmitted by droplets or mucus. Wash your hands before touching your baby or his food. Dang, am I starting to sound like a broken record? But really, it is that simple to prevent sickness. Viruses are parasites - they cannot survive on their own. They need moisture and food from human bodies to live on. Even if a sick person sneezes and the droplets land on, say, the pavement, once it dries out, the viruses die with it. So you’d have to touch a still-wet drop of saliva, then lick your hand or touch your food in order to get the virus into your body. So really, just wash your hands. Now, since babies are filthy creatures who touch everything and then stuff their fists into their mouths all the time, keep them away from infected people (don’t go to hospitals and clinics for "well-baby" checkups - well babies don’t need to go to the hospital), and wash their hands. Don’t use antibacterial soap either because that would just leave the most resistant ones to procreate.<br/>
<br/>
This vaccine contains aluminium, formaldehyde and yeast. Why are you worried about viruses <i>possibly </i>getting into your baby’s brain and causing meningitis? Why don’t you inject aluminium into your baby’s brain, then you can damage his brain <i>for sure</i>. The effect of aluminium on the body and brain - muscle wasting, impaired speech and swallowing (in children, manifesting as lateness to start talking, unclear speech and excessive drooling), difficulty in breathing, motor neuron degeneration - which means the death of cells in the part of the brain that controls bodily movement. In children, this manifests as lateness to start walking, poor coordination, and poor and slow handwriting. (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2819810">Source</a>) When they reach school age, this will be called dyslexia.<br/>
<br/>
This vaccine also contains lactose. Lactose is the sugar in cow’s milk. Injecting milk is a surefire way of creating an allergy to milk.<br/>

<b>8. Polio</b><br/>
<br/>
Polio spreads through faeces. We have modern sanitation systems and piped water now. You no longer poop in the outhouse and drink from the well right next to it. If you are the one with polio, wash your hands after wiping your ass and before touching your baby’s food, simple as that. If you get the polio virus (from eating someone else’s faeces), the virus will grow in your stomach and... nothing happens. Your immune system destroys it. In 1% of the cases (if your immune system is weaker than the virus), the virus wins and migrates to the brain and grows there, destroying brain tissue, causing paralysis. So should you take the vax in the off-chance that your child might be that unlucky 1%? If your child’s immune system is so weak or non-existent (under the age of 2) that she can’t fight off the polio virus, then she might not be able to fight off the virus in the vaccine either, which means she will succumb to polio. Remember, vaccines don’t give you immunity - your immune system does.<br/>
<br/>
But in case you really are too lazy to wash your hands before you touch your baby’s food, you could inject her with formaldehyde, aluminium and neomycin, and they would create the same brain damage for you. Ah, who needs viruses to kill your brain when you can DIY!<br/>
<br/>
Some brands also contain kidney cells from the African Green Monkey, which was used to cultivate this virus. Two super viruses were introduced into humans via the polio vaccine - one of them is the <a href="http://www.naturalpedia.com/polio_vaccine.html" target="_blank">SV40 (simian virus #40)</a>, which causes brain cancer.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
Dr. Edward Shorter (interviewer): Tell me how you found SV40 and the polio vaccine. <br/>
<br/>
Dr. Maurice Hilleman, leading vaccine developer at Merck: Well, that was at Merck. Yeah, I came to Merck. And I was going to develop vaccines. And we had wild viruses in those days. You remember the wild monkey kidney viruses and so forth? And finally after 6 months, I gave up and said that you cannot develop vaccines with these damn monkeys. We’re finished. And if I can’t do something, I’m going to quit, I’m not going to try it. So I went down to see Bill Mann at the zoo in Washington DC and I told Bill Mann, I said, “Look, I got a problem and I don’t know what the hell to do.” Bill Mann is a real bright guy. I said that these lousy monkeys are picking it up [the SV40 virus] while being stored in the airports in transit, loading, off-loading. He said very simply, you go ahead and get your monkeys out of West Africa and get the African Green [monkey], bring them into Madrid, unload them there. There is no other traffic there for animals, fly them into Philadelphia and pick them up. Or fly them into New York and pick them up, right off the airplane. So we brought African Greens in and I didn’t know we were importing the AIDS virus at the time.”<br/>

Ha, and you thought someone in Africa had sex with a monkey, got bitten, and spread AIDS to everyone. No, it infected humans through THE POLIO VACCINE.<br/>
<br/>
Vaccine makers can only inactivate viruses if they know which virus to inactivate. The above is what happens when there are new viruses in the specimen that scientists have not seen before. How many new viruses have emerged in recent years? SARS? Bird flu? Nipah? Swine flu/H1N1? (Oh wait, <a href="http://healthbitesonline.blogspot.my/2009/05/swine-flu-may-be-human-error-who.html">H1N1 was produced by Roche</a>.) What else have we not discovered that are in the cells of the animals used to culture the viruses? Well, let your baby find out.<br/>
<br/>
So anyway, that’s six viruses in one day. Not counting the unknown ones. Can your baby’s immune system, kidneys, liver and brain withstand all of them in one day? What happened to all those children who got the polio vaccine in the 50’s before the SV40 virus was discovered after EIGHT years? (Presumably only after a heck lot of adverse events were reported to the CDC and an investigation was started - as usual, AFTER the vaccine has been sold to the public.) Did they get brain cancer and die in a few years? Did they ask their mummies why they got cancer? Did they get brain cancer 30, 50 years later? Did they ask, “Why me???” Well, now you know why. Because their parents trusted doctors and the govt to care for their children. What else is lurking in today’s vaccine that have not been discovered yet?<br/>

<b>9. Hepatitis B #3.</b> Well, since your baby had no immune system at 2 months, he did not create antibodies to the first shot. Told you so. Now you try again. “Booster”, they call it. The only thing that it boosts is your doctor’s income.<br/>

<b>10. Diphtheria #2.</b> The DTaP (diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis) vaccine causes apnoeas and hypopnoeas.<br/>
<br/>
“Apnoeas are pauses in breathing and up to a certain time limit (20 seconds), are normal. Hypopnoeas are episodes of shallow, below 5% of the normal unstressed breathing volume, breathing which represents a stress-induced breathing pattern. When Scheibner and Karlsson studied the charts, they noticed that whenever the babies had had a vaccination, the charts began to show clusters of stress-induced breathing pattern, which followed the pattern of what they called critical hours and days. This proved conclusively that it was the vaccines that were causing the babies to have periods of stress-induced breathing.” (<a href="http://www.americanchronicle.com/articles/view/205170">Source</a>)<br/>
<br/>
So a baby sometimes stops breathing for 20 seconds, or breathes less than 5% of the normal volume after vcacination. What happens when the child stops breathing for longer than 20 seconds? SIDS. Sudden Infant Death Syndrome. That’s what doctors call it when babies die when you are not looking. Don’t know why. Babies just suddenly stop breathing because that’s what babies do. Nobody dies suddenly, really. There are always warning signs. But usually parents don’t recognise it and doctors tell you it’s nothing. Irregular breathing is not nothing!!! It means the part of the brain that controls breathing has been damaged.<br/>
<br/>
Here is a story that is now only too typical of what happens to many children after they get the DTaP vaccine: <a href="http://www.whale.to/vaccine/laura.html">Laura, 3 months old</a>. The urination is the body trying to get rid of toxins. Learn to recognise the signs. There are always signs before your baby dies. Nobody just drops dead. Learn, learn, learn!!!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<b>11. Tetanus #2.</b> Immunity from the tetanus vaccine is supposed to last 10 years. It has only been one month from the last shot. Has your baby lost his immunity already? Or was it never created in the first place? More importantly, has all the mercury from the last shot been eliminated? Did your doctor test for your baby’s mercury levels before administering another dose of mercury?<br/>
<br/>
It always amuses me to see parents making a lot of noise about lead in children’s toys, then pay for their children to be injected with mercury, which is 1,000 times more toxic than lead. That is to say, 1 unit of mercury causes the same damage as 1,000 units of lead. So, please don’t bother the toy manufacturers anymore. Come on, they need to make a profit too, just like pharma.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<b>12. Pertussis #2.</b> Has your baby developed allergies and cancer yet? Died in her cot? No? Alright, let’s try again and give her a sixth dose of aluminium and formaldehyde and let’s see if it that does the trick.<br/>
<br/>
Neomycin, an antibiotic also added to this vaccine, is ototoxic. Oto means ear. That means it kills the cells of the inner ear. You can apply neomycin to your skin just fine, but if you inject it, it is circulated by your blood to all parts of your body and once it reaches your inner ear, kills the inner ear cells. If enough cells are killed, your child is deaf for life. If your baby is deaf or is has partial hearing loss, how do you know if she was born deaf or became deaf, considering that vaccines are given on the very first day of life? Many people would just blame God again, but it is more likely the God in white that you so worship.<br/>

The more vaccines given, the higher the infant mortality rate of the country. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3170075/">See the research here</a>.<br/>

<b>13. HIB #2.</b> Meningitis vax, same as above. No immunity created from the last shot. Otherwise, you would not need this again so soon.<br/>
<br/>
<b>14. Polio #2.</b> Same deal, right? Your baby is simply too young to create antibodies. You made him take all those toxins for nothing. And six viruses in one day, again. Nobody contracts six diseases in one day in nature. No body was ever designed for this.<br/>

<b>15. Diphtheria #3.</b> Still no immunity to the last shot. So you try again. Let’s see if another chemical cocktail does any good - more aluminium, formaldehyde, gelatin, polysorbate 80 and mercury. Now we add cow serum. This virus was cultivated in cow cells. Kinda Frankensteinian isn’t it, injecting cow cells into human ones? Eating cow cells is one matter, injecting cow cells is a whole ’nother different matter. What other mystery viruses does this cow harbour, do you know?<br/>
<br/>
<b>16. Tetanus #3.</b> That’s the third shot in three months. Is your baby bitten by diseased animals a lot? Can’t afford to keep a bottle of hydrogen peroxide at home? Doctor forgot know how to clean wounds properly? Or is the vaccine ineffective because your baby’s immune system is too undeveloped to develop immunity, hence requiring three shots in three months for immunity that is supposed to last 10 years? How about waiting until he has an immune system to speak of? And if his immune system is that undeveloped, what about his eliminative organs that are required to excrete the mercury, aluminium and formaldehyde? What happens if you give him another dose of mercury before the previous dose has been completely eliminated? Remember, whatever mercury is not quickly eliminated circulates around the body and sticks to what it likes best - fat. The fattiest organ is the brain. Once mercury is in the brain, it changes into its inorganic (metal) form and then it takes the body 60 years to remove it. Why do you suppose old people have more dementia and Alzheimer’s? A lifetime of accumulated mercury never removed.<br/>

<b>19. Polio #3.</b> What are the symptoms of cases of polio where the virus was not destroyed by the immune system and has moved to the brain? It damages brain tissue, and the result is paralysis. Look at the <a href="http://wonder.cdc.gov/vaers.html">VAERS database</a> (the CDC’s self-reporting system for adverse events to vaccines). Here is the data for the polio vaccine (both live and dead virus vaccines), as of today, November 2012.<br/>
  <br/>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
<a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ucHNctVVOvY/UKKGuInnSUI/AAAAAAAABgs/FuqLgXGFyuQ/s1600/polio+vaers+vaccine+adverse+events+paralysis.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="232" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ucHNctVVOvY/UKKGuInnSUI/AAAAAAAABgs/FuqLgXGFyuQ/s400/polio+vaers+vaccine+adverse+events+paralysis.JPG" width="400"/></a></div>
<br/>
Look at the number of people who reported “permanent disability” after receiving the vaccine. You inject the polio virus and then you become paralysed. Is that not polio, hello??? Many died too. Keep in mind that less than 1% of events are reported to VAERS, so make that 139,500 deaths and 86,400 permanently paralysed. And that’s just in the USA. You see a lot of children in wheelchairs nowadays.<br/>
<br/>
“Outbreaks of vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis [paralysis caused by the vaccine itself] occurred independently in Belarus (1965-1966), Canada (1966-1968), Egypt (1983-1993), Dominican Republic (2000-2001), Philippines (2001), Madagascar (2001-2002), Haiti (2002), China (2006), Cambodia (2005-2006), Myanmar (2006-2007), Iran (1995, 2005-2007), Syria, Kuwait and Egypt. Since 2005, the World Health Organization has been tracking vaccine-caused polio in northern Nigeria caused by a mutation in live oral polio vaccines.” (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polio_vaccine">Source and links.</a>) Get that - paralysed forever - by the polio <b>vaccine</b>.<br/>
<br/>
Polio will never be eradicated as long as doctors keep injecting everyone with it. You don’t need to fear that “deadly diseases” will make a comeback because polio is still well and alive - in the bottle! One that you willingly paid for. Except that they don’t call it polio anymore, which is reserved only for wild polio. (There are many strains of viruses.) Vaccine-caused polio has been renamed as viral meningitis, aseptic meningitis, acute flaccid paralysis and Guillian-Barre Syndrome, just so ignorant parents don’t get all in a huff and sue someone for giving their child POLIO! Read more about how <a href="http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2012/05/08/polio-vaccine-ineffective.aspx">wild polio has been replaced by vaccine polio</a>. Live viruses do whatever they want in the bottle, including mutating. That’s what viruses do. The vaccine that left the factory may not be the same vaccine your child gets. So you take your chances and pray that someone else’s child gets the bad bottle, not yours, huh?<br/>

<b>20. Hepatitis B #4</b>. The STD vaccine that didn’t work, again.<br/>
<br/>
That’s another round of six vaccines in one day. Did you know that manufacturers have never tested vaccines in combination? That’s because they don’t know what combination of vaccines you are going to choose to take in one day, or from which combination of companies, and they most certainly are not going to test it with their competitors’ products. So you pay them to test it on your child. Hey, less expenses for them, and more profit too!<br/>

Live-virus
 vaccines contain weak strains of the virus. Viruses are cultured in lab
 animals. Scientists infect a batch of animals - rabbits, monkeys, rats,
 pigs, or whatever they can survive in, with the virus. A whole of lot 
animals would die off. Those who survived are assumed to have got a 
weaker strain of the virus. This virus is derived and cultured in the 
second generation. Repeat this with 50 generations or as many as is 
required. The last strain derived is the weakest one. In theory, the 
virus is now too weak to cause disease but since it has the same DNA, 
our immune system can still recognise it and create antibodies to them. 
However, don’t forget that it is the nature of viruses to mutate (that’s
 how the weak virus was isolated), and the runt can revert to its more 
virulent form at any given time and cause disease and/or kill the host.<br/>
<br/>
“Not
 everyone can safely receive live, attenuated vaccines. For their own 
protection, people who have damaged or weakened immune systems—because 
they’ve undergone chemotherapy or have HIV, for example—cannot be given 
live vaccines.” Source: <a href="http://www.niaid.nih.gov/topics/vaccines/understanding/pages/typesvaccines.aspx">http://www.niaid.nih.gov/topics/vaccines/understanding/pages/typesvaccines.aspx</a><br/>
<br/>
People
 can have a weak immune system due to a genetic defect too. And what of 
children who have weak immune systems because they are simply too young?
 Or who have received too many toxins that have weakened their immune 
systems? Or who do not eat a nutritious diet, like those who live on 
processed food and soft drinks? Or like the children in Africa and India
 who simply don’t have enough to eat and are given vaccines and die like
 flies? That’s where all the world’s recalled and <a href="http://healthbitesonline.blogspot.com/2009/03/sri-lanka-halts-vaccination-drive-after_6036.html">expired vaccines end up</a>, under the auspices of WHO/UNICEF. But I digress.<br/>
<br/>
What
 happens in those who can’t fight off even the weak virus in the vaccine
 is that the virus is still alive when it reaches the intestines (your 
body eliminates everything via the faeces). It then takes up residence 
in the gut. “Right behind the gut epithelium [inner lining of the gut], 
lie cells of the intestinal immune system, the biggest immune system of 
the body. [90% of your immune system is in your gut.] It detects the 
invading bacteria or viruses and generates a strong immune response to 
fight off the invaders. In the process, the immune cells secrete a 
cocktail of signals that bring about the symptoms of inflammation. 
Inflammatory signals reach the epithelial cells that are very sensitive 
to them and die. The death of more epithelial cells creates bigger gaps 
in the gut lining so that more bacteria can enter. The result is a 
constant immune response and a chronic inflammation.” Live-virus 
vaccines like the MMR can damage the bowels by causing the body to 
create chronic inflammation and destroy itself. Now your child has what 
is called Leaky Gut Syndrome. The large holes in the wall of the 
intestine allow semi-digested proteins to escape into the bloodstream, 
causing allergies, eczema, asthma, ADHD and autism. This one vaccine 
alone (the MMR) accounts for 28% of cases of autism caused by vaccines, 
as reported in the CDC’s VAERS database. (<a href="http://healthbitesonline.blogspot.com/2012/10/dr-wakefields-study-on-mmr-and-autism.html">Read more about how MMR causes autism.</a>)<br/>
<br/>
Does
 your child have a weak immune system or a genetic defect? Did 
your paediatrician do a gene test before administering a vaccine? Does 
he even know which gene test to order? Or did he say that it’s 
unnecessary and that the chances are slim, blah blah, and that you 
should let him play Russian roulette with your child? Many children with
 autism crash when given the MMR because they have received 22 doses of 
toxins in a year and their immune system has been significantly 
weakened, such that they cannot even handle the weak strain of the 
measles virus in the bottle.<br/>
<br/>
The rate of measles?  <a href="http://www.hmetro.com.my/myMetro/articles/Beriizinsuntikanak/Article/index_html">1 in 18,000</a>, and nobody died. (See <a href="http://thinktwice.com/measles.htm">how to cure measles with Vitamin A</a>.) Autism? <a href="http://healthbitesonline.blogspot.com/2011/05/autism-now-affects-1-in-38-children.html">1 in 25</a>, and <a href="http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2008/4/27/focus/21080181&amp;sec=focus">increasing at 30% every year</a>. And that’s not even counting epilepsy, permanent disability and death. Pick your poison.<br/>
<br/>
Does your doctor still deny that the MMR vaccine causes autism? There is <a href="http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/112/3/604.abstract">one famous paper that all doctors cite (“the Denmark study”)</a>
 that says mercury is non-toxic, harmless, safe to 
inject and does not cause autism. The paper and the author have been 
found to be fraudulent.<br/>
<br/>
“As the HHS [US Health and Human Services] names vaccine researcher Dr. Poul Thorsen
 as one of its <a href="https://oig.hhs.gov/fraud/fugitives/profiles.asp">“Most Wanted” fugitives</a>,
 the defense of mercury as ‘safe in vaccines’ seems to be crumbling. 
Thorsen embezzled at least one to two million dollars of grant money 
from the CDC.<br/>
<br/>
(Read about <a href="http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2011/10/28/cdc-director-arrested-for-child-molestation--bestiality.aspx?e_cid=20111028_DNL_art_1">how he showed that autism increased 20-fold after mercury was banned in Denmark</a>.)<br/>
<br/>
CDC documents show that Thorsen concealed the fact that <i>autism declined</i> in Denmark <i>after mercury was removed </i>from the Danish vaccination program.<br/>
<br/>
Today, the US government and the WHO defend the ongoing use of thimerosal (mercury) based on a handful of <i>industry-sponsored statistical studies</i>,
 including Thorsen’s. The manufacturer’s Material Safety Data Sheet for 
thimerosal, however, lists mental retardation as a possible outcome from
 exposure in utero and in children. Despite this, the NIH [US National 
Institutes of Health] and CDC continue to collaborate with Thorsen using
 federal funds. Thorsen remains in Denmark, and no date for his 
extradition has been made public.” (<a href="http://www.sacbee.com/2012/11/15/4988696/discriminatory-vaccine-policy.html">Source</a>)<br/>

<br/>
So Thorsen got a million bucks to write a 
paper to debunk the link between mercury and autism. Sweet! Lucrative 
career, doctors. Remember who those people are who sit on the CDC 
vaccine approval committee who own shares in pharma? That’s why the CDC 
is still continuing their collaboration with him. That is why his paper 
has not been retracted or his license revoked and him turned into a 
pariah and hung up to dry, like <a href="http://healthbitesonline.blogspot.com/2012/10/dr-wakefields-study-on-mmr-and-autism.html">the honest Dr. Wakefield</a>.
 Research and publication is not all about science as you thought eh? 
The next time your doctor says injecting mercury is safe, <a href="http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2011/10/28/cdc-director-arrested-for-child-molestation--bestiality.aspx?e_cid=20111028_DNL_art_1">show him this article</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Here
 are 19 other oft-cited studies that show that vaccines do not cause 
autism. Thorsen was not the only one. Your doctor may be fond of citing 
these too and telling you that Wakefield was a fraud and you’re an 
idiot. Oh no, it’s not Wakefield who’s a fraud, nor you who is an idiot.
 Look at these papers that say vaccines are harmless - who paid the 
authors and who funded the studies: <a href="http://www.14studies.org/studies.html">http://www.14studies.org/studies.html</a>.<br/>
<br/>
How
 chummy is the CDC with pharma? If you have a top-level job as the head 
of the CDC, you would want to stay there until retirement, make a fat 
paycheque every month, then collect a fat pension, right? Perhaps with a
 few extra million under the table, but hey, who’s counting? Nice cushy 
job, no? Would you want to leave a job like that? Not most people. But 
Dr. Julie Geberding did. Gerberding was the top dog, head honcho, big 
kahuna <b>director</b> of the CDC from 2002 to 2009, and all the fat 
paycheques and fat lifetime pension could not keep her from leaving her

<b>24. Mumps</b> <br/>

All the
 same ingredients and risks as the above. So many toxins to pump into 
your baby just so she can avoid missing the beauty pageant for a week. 
Tsk tsk.<br/>
<br/>
And the best side effect of the mumps vaccine?
 “Swelling of glands in the cheeks or neck”. Ahahaha.... Is that not 
mumps itself, hello?? Remember, no immune system = get the disease. This
 is a live-virus vaccine. You just paid to make your baby sick. Your

<br/>
And
 what if your baby gets a fever after being hit with so many viruses? 
(Fever is the body's way of killing viruses and is a natural response. 
However, if a fever becomes too high, the brain will be cooked and the 
child will have seizures, be permanently paralysed or brain damaged, or 
die.) So how do you stop a fever? Most doctors will prescribe Panadol 
(acetaminophen/paracetamol).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And -this- is the beginning of the descent into autism (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18445737">Schultz, 2008</a>).
 How? Your body produces glutathione, which is an antioxidant which 
binds with heavy metals so that they can be flushed out. (Heavy metals 
bind to fats and dislike water, so they are not easily carried out by 
the blood.) So they stick around in your fatty organs, the fattiest one 
being your brain. Acetaminophen depletes glutathione, which means the 
body can no longer remove the heavy metals, and so more remain in your 
body to destroy your brain, liver, kidneys and everything else. However,
 ibuprofen does not have such an effect. Can you count on doctors to 
know this and not give your child Panadol for a fever after vaccination?
 If they did, there wouldn't be so many autistic kids everywhere you 
turned.<br/>

viruses lasts only a couple of years for most people. Why take this 
vaccine at age 1?<br/>
<br/>
Side effects? A fever and a rash. 
Hmm... starting to sound familiar? You never know when or where you can 
get rubella, but there is one very sure way of getting it - injecting it
 directly into your bloodstream!<br/>

<b>26*. Japanese encephalitis</b> (Sarawak only). A mosquito-borne disease. You need this jab cos you are lazy and throw rubbish everywhere and breed the mosquitoes yourself. This is a live-virus, genetically engineered vaccine (the Japanese encephalitis virus spliced onto the yellow fever virus). You get 2 viruses, or one mutant virus for the price of 1! Now that’s really Frankensteinian! Not so long ago, “the <a href="http://worldtruth.tv/merck-scientist-dr-maurice-hilleman-admitted-presence-of-sv40-aids-and-cancer-viruses-in-vaccines-2/">yellow fever vaccine had a leukemia-causing virus in it</a>”, according to Dr. Maurice Hilleman, head vaccine developer at Merck. So if you know a child who has leukemia, do tell their parents who gave it to them. This vaccine also contains formaldehyde, gelatine, polysorbate 80, mercury, and here’s a new one - mouse proteins! More cancer, more brain damage and more infertility. And an allergy to mice.<br/>
<br/>
Your child should not take this vaccine if he already has an allergy to rodents. The CDC actually has a long list of situations when you should <i>not</i> take a particular vaccine. Download it and give it to your doctor if he gives you grief: <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/recs/vac-admin/downloads/contraindications-guide-508.pdf">http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/recs/vac-admin/downloads/contraindications-guide-508.pdf</a>  I think it is still too lax - “Continue vaccinating even if child gets epilepsy after first dose.” Seriously???<br/>

<b>27. Measles #2.</b> If it worked the first time, why 
would you need a booster? Obviously it didn’t, or immunity had waned. So
 it’s not true what that drug pusher in the white coat said about your 
child being protected for life, is it? Getting the real measles will 
give you immunity for life. Immunity to the vaccine virus lasts for only
 a years. That is why we constantly hear news that <a href="http://www.naturalnews.com/033399_vaccines_measles.html" target="_blank">70-100% of people who have been vaccinated for measles get measles anyway.</a><br/>
<br/>
Since this is a live-virus vaccine, it does not contain mercury, aluminium and formaldehyde. But, it does contain:<br/>
<br/>
<i>Gelatine,</i> from cows or pigs. Injecting foreign proteins creates allergies to that protein.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Neomycin.</i> Neomycin is an antibiotic. Injecting neomycin can cause deafness. See article:  <a href="http://www.examiner.com/article/mmr-vaccine-caused-deafness-two-u-k-children-formally-recorded-10">MMR vaccine caused deafness in two UK children, formally recorded in ten</a>. (It’s not the virus, it’s the antibiotic.)<br/>
<br/>
<i>Sorbitol.</i>
“Sorbitol can aggravate irritable bowel syndrome and similar 
gastrointestinal conditions, resulting in severe abdominal pain for 
those affected, even from small amounts ingested.” (What about 
injected?) In case the damage from the virus itself if not bad enough, 
this will ensure that your child’s bowel is destroyed. 99 out of 100 
autistic children have gastrointestinal problems. Does your child have 
food intolerances, bloating, colic, diarrhoea, constipation? Suddenly 
can no longer take food or breastmilk that he has been taking all along?
 Gastrointestinal problem. Sorbitol plus the measles virus.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Cow serum. </i>Injecting foreign proteins causes allergies.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Chicken egg protein.</i>
If your child does not have an allergy to eggs, injecting egg proteins 
is a good way or creating an allergy to eggs. If he allergy has an 
allergy to chicken eggs, injecting egg proteins is a sure way to 
increase his allergy quotient for many years. If it’s already very bad 
to begin with, he might die from anaphylaxis, so be sure to admit him to
 the hospital for a couple of weeks after injecting eggs. Often 
allergies don’t show up until 2 weeks later. In case he stops breathing,
 resuscitation equipment is close at hand. Has your child started eating
 solid food, specifically chicken eggs, by 1 year old? Do you know if he
 has an allergy? How do you know he does not?<br/>

<br/>
Using chicken eggs also means myelin from 
the chick embryos end up in the soup. (Myelin is the fatty coating that 
insulates nerve cells.) When injected into your body, your immune system
 creates antibodies to myelin. When the chick myelin has been disposed 
of, the antibodies attack your own myelin because myelin is myelin is 
myelin. Now you have an autoimmune disease. 58% of children with autism 
have antibodies to myelin basic protein - their immune system is 
destroying their own brain and nervous system.<br/>
<br/>
“Immunological
 testing of autistic children has shown certain features that are also 
found in patients with autoimmune diseases such as lupus (SLE), thyroid 
disease, ankylosing spondylitis (chronic arthritis of the spine), 
rheumatoid arthritis, insulin-dependent diabetes (Type 1 diabetes), and 
multiple sclerosis (MS). At birth, there is very little myelin in the 
brain, and the synthesis of myelin may not be complete until the age of 
10 years or older in the normal child. It has been suggested that some 
children with learning disabilities may have delayed or incomplete 
myelin development.” (<a href="http://kildall.apana.org.au/autism/articles/myelin.html">Source</a>)<br/>
<br/>
<i>Human diploid cells.</i>
 Some brands grow their viruses in human cells to circumvent the problem
 of egg allergies. Do you know where these cells come from? Dead babies.
 Aborted foetuses, to be specific. Injecting dead babies into your baby.
 Gross! Well, technically there are no human cells left in the vaccine. 
The human cell is only used as a host for the virus. Remember, viruses 
are parasites. They are such a basic organism that they can’t even 
reproduce, and has to hijack a human cell and use its reproductive 
mechanism to make copies of itself. When the virus infects a cell, it 
makes the cell produce so many copies of itself until the cell bursts 
and releases the viruses to move on to infect other cells. So 
technically, there is no <i>whole</i> human cell left in the culture, only bits and pieces.<br/>
<br/>
What
 happens when you inject foreign proteins into the human body? Your 
immune system attacks it. It creates antibodies to foreign cells - virus
 cells, human cells, all of them. What body parts are contained in these
 human cells? What happens when 
your body creates antibodies to these human body parts like it did to 
myelin? And what happens when it runs out of foreign cells to attack? 
Now you have an autoimmune disease. Yahoo.<br/>
<br/>
Besides, do you know what diseases that aborted baby had?<br/>
<br/>
For
 that matter, what diseases did the chickens above have? Avian flu? 
SARS? H1N1? These were all newly-discovered viruses. Scientists can only
 look for and eliminate what they recognise. What else is in there that 
they have not identified yet?<br/>
<br/>
Are all the above possible risks better or worse than getting a fever and a rash for a few days? <br/>
<br/>
Oh,
 and the best “side effect” from the vaccine? A fever and a rash. 
Haha... Is that not measles itself?? Remember, no immune system = no 
resistance.

Here is <a href="http://www.oru.edu/current_students/my_services/health_services/pdfs/measles_mumps_rubella.pdf">the official list of symptoms and side effects</a>
 from the US Department of Health. Isn’t it amusing that even the 
government’s list of reasons for not vaccinating is longer than the list
 of reasons why you should?<br/>
<br/>
And, it also sheds. The 
virus from the vaccine will come out through your child’s bodily fluids,
 so you can catch measles from him. Nice! Now everyone in the household,
 nursery, supermarket and school and can catch measles for free from 
your child. He may very well develop immunity and be fine, but you and 
all his schoolmates will get sick. But that’s ok, now everyone around 
him will have immunity for life. But he won’t. Immunity from the real 
disease lasts a lifetime. Immunity to the virus in the vaccine lasts 
less than 2 years max. The younger the child, the shorter the period of 
immunity because their immune system is simply not mature 
yet. That is, if they even develop immunity at all. So anyway, if you do
 decide to vax with live viruses, please do everyone else a favour and 
lock yourself and your child at home for 2 weeks.<br/>
<br/>
Here’s
 some interesting info on what happened with measles in Canada over a 
span of 
50 years. Who says vaccines wiped out diseases? It was already in sharp 
decline before the vaccine was introduced. One can only assume that it 
is due to improved sanitation. The vaccine was introduced in 1963 and 
then the decline slowed considerably. Knowing what you know about live 
viruses shedding, what do you think is still keeping measles around now?
 If we had left it alone, doesn’t it look like measles would’ve died out
 by itself in the 60’s?<br/>

Okay, now here’s the bad news - a child’s immune system does not mature until he’s about 2 years old. So what happens if he’s given a vaccine between age 1, when he starts to produce antibodies, and age 2, when the immune system has matured? Between then, the memory cells of the immune system are too immature to retain the ‘formula’ for the antibody (presuming antibody was even created in the first place). What this means is that if your child managed to create antibodies between the ages of 1 and 2, and encounters the same virus again after age 2, he would still get the disease because the antibody from the first time had been lost, simply because the immune system’s memory cells were still too immature to store whatever formula was created then. So now we are up to 29 vaccines and 300 toxins for nothing. I didn’t list all the toxins here because it would be too long. <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/downloads/appendices/B/excipient-table-2.pdf">Everything is here</a>, except the things that they are allowed to hide because the lawmakers at the CDC (who are themselves owners of vaccine companies) made a law to allow their own companies to elude listing harmful ingredients. How’s that for shrewd business acumen? Malaysian politicians aren’t the only ones with cronies.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<u><b>21 months</b></u><br/>
<br/>
<b>35. Japanese encephalitis #2</b> (Sarawak only). Cos it didn’t work the first time, and your paediatrician needs a new yacht.<br/>
<br/>
I’m
 only half-jesting about the yacht. Here is why your paediatrician keeps
 telling you vaccines are safe in spite of the mountains of research 
that says otherwise. Either your doctor never reads journals (which is 
pretty worrying), or...<br/>
<br/>
“In 2009, Merck released a 
72-page document showing they paid doctors US$19 million in the third 
and fourth quarters of that year for medical doctors to speak favorably 
about their pills and vaccines. Because a doctor has an M.D. attached to
 his or her name and wears a white coat, 65% of the people will follow 
their orders without asking questions.” (<a href="http://vactruth.com/2012/08/28/pharma-admits-to-bribes/">Source</a>) Well, any which way, they get a yacht.<br/>
<br/>
Now,
 here’s something else your doctor didn’t tell you: A baby’s immune 
system cannot produce antibodies until he is about one year old. “It is 
pointless to administer drugs intended to stimulate antibody production 
to babies who are too young to produce antibodies. Infants in their 
first year mostly depend on generalized, non-specific immunity, 
including immunoglobulins from breast milk, to protect their young 
bodies from infection. They do not produce antibodies of their own until
 about age one. Despite this basic fact, the medical establishment 
insists on administering a total of 19 shots, containing 24 vaccines, to
 infants on the 2, 4 and 6 month pediatric visits.” - Dr. Michael Gaeta.
 This was confirmed by a PhD immunologist. (<a href="http://gaetacommunications.com/site/?p=1092">Read more here.</a>)<br/>
<br/>
It is important to breastfeed your baby because the mother’s 
antibodies will be passed on to the child via breastmilk. Maternal 
antibodies provide immunity for about 6 months, so the longer you 
breastfeed your child, the longer he is protected.<br/>
<br/>
So 
all those 22 shots were for nothing and only served to deliver toxins to
 your baby. And lighten your wallet. One payment for the yacht done.<br/>

<b><eliminated> Tuberculosis #2.</eliminated></b> The booster at 7 years old has been cancelled because it plain doesn't work. Too bad for all those who took this before and got all the brain-destroying chemicals for nothing. Sucks to be a sheeple!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<u><b>13 years old</b></u><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<b>40*. HPV (human papillomavirus)</b> (girls only).
 The most deadly vaccine ever invented. HPV is a sexually-transmitted 
virus that causes genital warts. Like all viruses, it is usually 
eliminated by the immune system, but if you are weak, the virus lives on
 and may cause cervical cancer 30 years down the road. There is plenty 
of time to catch it. The HPV vaccine is a long story that needs a 
separate blog post, so I’ll keep it short here. Meanwhile, you can <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/std/hpv/stdfact-hpv.htm">learn more about HPVs here.</a><br/>
<br/>
There
 are more than 100 types of HPVs. Of these, 40 cause genital warts 
(which are gross but harmless). 9 types can cause cancer in people who 
have very weak immune systems.<br/>
<br/>
HPV numbers:<br/>
80% of Americans have had HPV.<br/>
90% of HPV infections are caused by two harmless strains: #6 and #11. These strains <i>rarely</i> ever cause cancer.<br/>
95% of HPV viruses are eliminated by the immune system. Many people never have any symptoms at all.<br/>
5%
 of infections turn into pre-cancers because you eat junk, don’t 
exercise and your immune system has gone on strike. Even so, if you get 
regular Pap tests, these pre-cancers would be detected and dealt with, 
and it would not proceed to cancer.<br/>
9 strains can cause cancer: #16, 18, 31, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52 and 58. (<a href="http://www.webmd.com/sexual-conditions/hpv-genital-warts/hpv-virus-information-about-human-papillomavirus">Source</a>)<br/>
1 in 14,000 women in the US get cervical cancer every year. That is 0.007% of the population.<br/>
<br/>
There
 are two HPV vaccines on the market: Cervarix from GlaxoSmithKline 
contains strains #16 and 18 (the more virulent ones), and Gardasil from 
Merck contains strains #16 and 18 (the more virulent ones) and #6 and 11
 (the low-risk ones). (<a href="http://www.fda.gov/BiologicsBloodVaccines/Vaccines/ApprovedProducts/ucm172678.htm">Source</a>)<br/>
<br/>
So what is the use of this vaccine exactly? Suppose you take this jab and manage to develop immunity to the <b>two</b>
 strains that cause cancer, what about the other seven that are 
transmitted exactly the same way and causes the same cancer? If you 
contracted HPV, how would you know which strain you got? If your child 
keeps on having unprotected sex with infected people, what about other 
nasty STDs for which there are no vaccines, like gonorrhea, syphilis, 
chlamydia, herpes, or best of all, HIV? (<a href="http://www.webmd.com/sexual-conditions/ss/slideshow-std-pictures-and-facts">More info and pics of STDs here.</a>) All are transmitted the same way. Would it not be more prudent to put on a condom and avoid ALL of them?<br/>
<br/>
Worse,
 what if your daughter had already had unprotected sex with infected 
people and contracted the virulent strains, but her immune system kept 
it under check, so she had no symptoms, thus never got tested and didn’t
 know? Or, already knew but lied to you because she doesn’t want you to 
know that she already had unprotected sex with infected people? <a href="http://www.fda.gov/ohrms/dockets/ac/06/briefing/2006-4222B3.pdf">According to Merck</a>, “If you have been exposed to HPV #16 or 18 prior to injection and take the vaccine, you <b>increase your risk</b> of precancerous lesions, or worse [cancer itself], by <b>44.6%</b>.”<br/>
<br/>
Here’s
 what the developer of the Gardasil vaccine, Dr. Diane Harper, says 
about this vaccine. An honest scientist for a change! (<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/marcia-g-yerman/an-interview-with-dr-dian_b_405472.html">Read the full interview here.</a>)<br/>
<br/>
• “Gardasil only maintains antibody titers for HPV 16 (<i>not</i> 18, <i>not</i> 11, <i>not</i> 6) at five years, making the 5-year coverage of Gardasil only for <b>one</b> type of cancer-causing HPV.”<br/>
<br/>
Nobody knows how long the immunity will last because the clinical trial <a href="http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa061741#t=articleResults">was only for 3 years</a>.
 Any claim of immunity lasting more than 3 years comes from information 
collected from people who paid to be guinea pigs - your children.<br/>
<br/>
•
 “Duration of efficacy is key to the entire question. If duration is at 
least 15 years, then vaccinating 11-year-old girls will protect them 
until they are 26 and will prevent some pre-cancers but postpone most 
cancers. If duration of efficacy is less than 15 years, then no cancers 
are prevented, only postponed.”<br/>
<br/>
If your child takes 
this jab at 13 and develops immunity which lasts for say, 5 years (until
 she is 17), and she starts having unprotected sex with infected people 
at age 21, then she got all the toxins for nothing. If she starts having
 unprotected sex with infected people at age 15, she will have immunity 
to all of ONE virus (out of more than 100) for two years before her 
immunity wanes. She will not have immunity to the other eight 
cancer-causing HPVs, so make sure she only has unprotected sex with 
people who have strain #16. Alternately, you could just teach her to use
 a condom and then she can be free to have sex with as many people with 
STDs as she likes and not catch anything (usually).<br/>
<br/>
• “There is <b>no reduction</b>
 of cervical cancer incidence in the United States with HPV vaccination 
as long as screening continues.” Pap smears are what detects and 
prevents cervical cancer, not vaccines.<br/>
<br/>
Now, can you 
believe the scientist who made the vaccine actually said this - “The 
marketing campaign was designed to incite the greatest fear possible in 
parents, so that there would be uptake of the vaccine. If parents and 
girls were told the benefits and harms of Pap screening and HPV vaccines
 as described above, an informed and valued decision would have been 
able to be made. Many may have chosen to continue with a lifetime of Pap
 screening and forgo the vaccines, with the unknowns of duration of 
efficacy and safety unable to be answered for many more years.” (until 
they collect more data from your guinea pigs.)<br/>
<br/>
“The 
rate of serious adverse events reported is 3.4/100,000 doses 
distributed. The current incidence rate of cervical cancer in the United
 States is 7/100,000 women.” If you include <i>all</i> adverse events, 
the rate is more like 8.5/100,000 - there are more injuries and deaths 
from the vaccine than the disease itself.<br/>
<br/>
“Neurologists at the American Neurological Association have concluded that Gardasil is associated with <b>autoimmune attacks on the neurologic system.</b>” <br/>
<br/>
The HPV vaccine is grown in yeast cells, contains polysorbate 80, sodium borate (borax - rat poison) and <b>very</b>
 high amounts of aluminium, which as you now know, is added to create 
inflammation, and which can pass through the blood-brain barrier into 
the brain. Aluminium is neurotoxic (kills nerve and brain cells), hence 
the above effect. By far, the most common side effects are fainting and 
seizures, followed by loss of muscle tone, chronic fatigue, chronic 
pain, rheumatoid arthritis, Type 1 diabetes, lupus, multiple sclerosis, 
blood clots, arrhythmia, heart attacks, stroke, paralysis, permanent 
paralysis, and in not so few cases, death. Some milder side effects are a
 severe allergic reaction to yeast, asthma, psoriasis, vitiligo, genital
 warts, urinary tract infections, congenital defects in babies, 
stillbirths and infertility. These are just fancy names for toxicity, 
inflammation and brain damage. And now new data (from paying guinea 
pigs) shows that the vaccine actually <a href="http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2012/10/16/unproven-hpv-vaccine-safety.aspx?e_cid=20121016_DNL_art_1">increases the rate of cervical pre-cancers and cervical cancer</a>.
 Ahahahahah. What happens when you pump the body full of toxins and 
heavy metals? Hint: it doesn’t make your immune system stronger.<br/>
<br/>
<b>41. HPV #2</b>.
 If you see no effect from the first one, try again. Clinical symptoms 
are hard to relate to real life, especially if you don’t understand 
medicalese. See <a href="http://sanevax.org/victims-2/">what life is like after a HPV vaccine</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<b>42. HPV #3</b>. If two is good, three must be better! See <a href="http://truthaboutgardasil.org/memorial/">those who died from the vaccine and how they died</a>.
 I wanted to say ‘what they died of’, but the official reason given was 
“Reason unknown”. If they were infants, it would be called SIDS.<br/>
<br/>
Now
 they recommend this vaccine for boys too, because boys are the ones 
spreading it among girls. Double the potential customers. Kaching!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<u><b>15 years old</b></u><br/>
<br/>
<b>43. Tetanus #5.</b> Now your child is actually old enough to create immunity to something (for a few years). But selling you six shots is more profitable than one, isn’t it?<br/>

The tetanus bacteria produces a toxin that causes paralysis. When you inject the toxin into the bloodstream... <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So... the total comes to 33 vaccines before the age of 2. (Up from 26 in the previous schedule.) Whew!! And all entirely useless because the body cannot create immunity at this age. And up to 43 vaccines by the age of 15. That's 10 times more than what I took as a child (born in the 70's).<br/>
<br/>
But wait, these are just the compulsory ones. What if you take the recommended ones as well? You have to pay for the optional ones yourself, so expect more sick kids among the rich. Well, that’s okay, right? They can afford the treatment.  More income for doctors, hey! There are so many children with cancer, 
there is an entire specialisation created for it - paediatric oncologists. 
Occupational therapy, physiotherapy and speech therapy centres used to be full of seniors learning to walk and talk again after getting strokes; they are now full of young children who have never even learned to walk or talk. There’s another new breed of doctors (good ones), who have sprung up to treat autism, epilepsy, bowel inflammation, allergies, eczema and other such vaccine injuries - <a href="http://healthbitesonline.blogspot.com/2009/05/what-is-biomedical-treatment.html">biomedical doctors</a>. They are doing a roaring trade as well, undoing the harm done by other doctors. Sick children are good for business all around! So here we go:<br/>

This usually happens when a child consumes water or food tainted by human faeces (rotavirus is transmitted via faeces), and the parents don’t have any other clean water to give the child when she is sick except more of the faeces-tainted water (they’re still too lazy to cook the water first), nor do they have oral rehydration salts - not even a pinch of salt or sugar in the house, so poor are they, and should the child not be able to even keep water down, then saline via IV is required, but the nearest clinic is a 7-day trek across the desert and the buffalo refused to work that day, so the poor child died of dehydration. Not of rotavirus though.<br/>
<br/>
This is a live-virus vaccine. If you were too lazy to wash your hands before preparing your child’s food, now you are really going to be in trouble because live viruses shed. That means the person who gets the vaccine (or virus, doesn’t matter, same thing), will eliminate the virus through their faeces, so now your entire household is at risk of catching rotavirus from your baby if you don’t wash your hands after changing her diapers. But anyway, so what. If you or your child gets diarrhoea, just take a capsule of probiotics every half hour and stay hydrated with clean water, oral rehydration salts (or 100 Plus), or coconut water (which is the same composition as our body salts). If there is vomiting and baby can’t keep that down, then take rice water. If she can’t even keep that down and is getting dehydrated, then take her to the hospital and get saline dripped in via IV. Done. If you live in a developed world and you let your child die of dehydration, well... next time, practise with a potted plant first.<br/>
<br/>
Besides, what are you going to do about salmonella, E. coli and the thousand other bugs out there that cause diarrhoea, for which there are no vaccines, other than washing your hands and keeping your immune system strong?<br/>

<b>16. Rotavirus #2.</b> Just in case everyone didn’t catch it the first time.<br/>
<br/>
Remember the six people who sit on the vaccine-approval committee of the CDC? One of them is the famous Dr. Paul Offit, commonly known as Dr. Proffit, inventor of the rotavirus vaccine at Merck. Isn’t that genius? You sit in a government position and mandate every child in the country to buy your vaccine (for which you earn 30% from every vaccine sold), because otherwise who in their right minds would want to buy your vaccine for one measly virus out of few hundred thousand that cause can diarrhoea?<br/>
<br/>
“There is a little-known federal advisory committee that has ridiculous power to add vaccines to the CDC’s schedule, the Advisory Committee of Immunizations Practices (“ACIP”). For a vaccine maker, landing one of your own people on the ACIP is pay dirt.<br/>
<br/>
Because we all know how sleazy the Rotavirus’s admission to the CDC [vaccination] schedule is, I will just summarize:<br/>
- Paul Offit, vaccine patent holder for rotavirus for Merck, was appointed to the ACIP, God knows why.<br/>
- He voted to add the [Rotarix by GlaxoSmithKline] rotavirus vaccine to the schedule (because his vaccine wasn’t ready for market yet).<br/>
- The Rotarix vaccine damaged a bunch of kids and was pulled from the market, but Offit abstained from recommending its removal.<br/>
- A couple years later, rotavirus got added back to the schedule, with Offit’s vaccine [RotaTeq by Merck] leading the way.<br/>
- Offit made tens of millions of dollars from the sale of the Merck rotavirus vaccine because he held the patent.”<b>  </b>(<a href="http://www.ageofautism.com/2009/09/rotavirus-the-vaccine-nobody-wants.html">Source</a>)<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, now you know why the CDC recommends you take their vaccines for diarrhoea.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<b>17. Pneumococcus.</b> For the pneumococcus bacteria which causes pneumonia. There are 90 strains of this bacteria. The vaccine has only 13.<br/>
<br/>
Contains mercury, phenol and soy protein. <br/>
<br/>
"Phenol is a highly poisonous, caustic substance derived from coal tar and used in the production of disinfectants, dyes, pharmaceuticals, plastics, germicides, and preservatives. Exposure may result in systemic poisoning, weakness, sweating, headache, shock, excitement, kidney damage, convulsions, cardiac or kidney failure, and death. Repeated exposure may also cause vomiting and mental disturbances. Phenol is considered to be corrosive to the skin and it is known to be a protoplasmic poison: i.e. toxic to all cells. Tests indicate that phenol actually inhibits phagocytic activity [the immune system]. The use of phenol in vaccine preparations introduces a poisonous and caustic substance into the body. Since it also inhibits phagocytic activity, it actually serves to debilitate, rather than stimulate, the immune response. Phagocytes serve as the body’s first line of defense against antigenic activity: they engulf and digest antigens and they cause other elements of the immune system to become activated. Since vaccines are meant to stimulate an immune response, the use of phagocyte-inhibiting phenols contradicts the basic rationale for using vaccines. Furthermore, harm cannot possibly be avoided when it is understood that at the same time that pathogens are being introduced into the body, phenols are acting to inhibit an appropriate immune response."---Catherine Diodati, MA<br/>
<br/>
"The pathways that cause the blood disorders and cancers from exposure to benzene are through bioactivation of phenol (the major metabolite which is highly toxic to and destroys the bone marrow) in the liver. That this causes genomic changes is well known but is not yet fully understood."---Edward Priestley<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
(The synthetic Vitamin K shot given at 1 day old also contains phenol.)<br/>
<br/>
And injecting soy proteins into the bloodstream? Proteins provoke an immune response because it is a foreign matter. Combined with mercury and aluminium which prod the immune system to continuously create inflammation, you now have an allergy to soy.<br/>

Vaccines don’t just hurt babies, children, adults and seniors, they hurt the unborn too. Oscar Duffy was two weeks from being born. His mother was given two vaccines with 7 viruses - flu (3 viruses), diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis and polio. Four days later, Oscar died in the womb. Surprise surprise? Mercury is concentrated in the cord blood, meaning that there is more mercury being pumped to the foetus than there is circulating around in his mother’s blood. His parents are now pushing for <a href="https://www.facebook.com/oscarsangels">Oscar’s Law</a> in the UK - trying to get doctors to explain the negative side effects to pregnant women before they agree to a jab. Haha... good luck with that! As a friend said, does a used-car salesman tell you what’s wrong with that car you want to give him a lot of money for? Or do you have to do your own research elsewhere or consult someone you trust to get an unbiased report?<br/>

<b>24. Rotavirus #3</b> - Wash your hands, wash your hands, wash your hands!!! Stop eating diseased people’s faeces! Or failing which, diarrhoea again. Well, can it be worse than the vaccine though?<br/>
<br/>
RotaTeq is a <b>genetically engineered vaccine</b> made of live, attenuated human-bovine hybridized reassortant rotaviruses. (<a href="http://www.fda.gov/downloads/BiologicsBloodVaccines/Vaccines/QuestionsaboutVaccines/ucm101457.pdf">Source: FDA.</a>) Gaaa... What is that?? @_@<br/>
<br/>
Reassortment is a process which happens when two similar viruses living in the same cell exchange genetic material. The resulting virus is a new hybrid that contains parts of both the original viruses.<br/>
<br/>
In 2008, thousands of chickens died in a new epidemic that swept Australia. Investigators found that farmers had been vaccinating their chickens with one strain of live virus, then they ran out of stock and bought another brand with a different strain and continued with the “booster” jabs. These are live viruses and the weak, unhealthy farm chickens which lived in unsanitary, crowded conditions, eating food contaminated with each others’ faeces, were not strong enough to fight off the first virus which continued to live and proliferate in their bodies. When injected with the second strain, these two strains combined into a new virus that was four times more deadly than the original one, which resulted in the deaths of thousands of chickens across Australia. (<a href="http://www.naturalnews.com/037045_vaccines_super_viruses_mutant_strains.html">Source</a>, <a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/notrocketscience/2012/07/12/chicken-vaccines-merged-to-form-live-viruses-and-caused-outbreaks-of-irony/">Article</a>).<br/>
<br/>
Combining two viruses in a new host was also how the H1N1 supervirus was 
created.  What, you still believe that viruses are carried over by the stork and not come straight out of pharma’s labs? The H1N1 virus contains genes from pig, bird and human flu viruses.
(<a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn17025-deadly-new-flu-virus-in-us-and-mexico-may-go-pandemic.html">Source</a>) It was cooked up in Roche’s lab in Australia (<a href="http://healthbitesonline.blogspot.com/2009/05/swine-flu-may-be-human-error-who.html">read full story here</a>).<br/>
<br/>
Reassortment is the process by which new flu vaccines are created by scientists in the lab every year. They tell you, “These are the strains that we predict are going to be carried to you by the stork next winter.”<br/>
<br/>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
<a href="http://www.niaid.nih.gov/topics/flu/research/basic/pages/reassortmentillustration.aspx"><img border="0" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-4fN4K-UScuc/UKcb5LvecxI/AAAAAAAABhQ/j9JKtkGG_OE/s1600/rotateq+genetically+engineered++hybrid+reassortant+vaccine+virus+copy.jpg"/></a></div>
<br/>
(<a href="http://www.niaid.nih.gov/topics/flu/research/basic/pages/reassortmentillustration.aspx">See larger pic: National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID).</a>)<br/>
<br/>
Above is how new flu viruses are MADE. And when people take this live-virus vaccine, they shed the live virus through their nose drops and others around them get the flu, then pharma says, “See, we told you this new strain we created was coming this year.” Well, duh...<br/>
<br/>
This reassortment process is what is used to create the rotavirus vaccine. Only better! For the RotaTeq vaccine, five strains of <i>human</i> rotavirus were combined with two strains of <i>cow</i> rotavirus and put into African Green <i>monkey</i> kidney cells and allowed to freely combine, mutate, lambada and turn into.... what? Human + cow + monkey = mystery meat loaf!  And this new, LIVE mutant virus is what they want to inject into your baby. This is not your everyday food poisoning bug from the unhygienic food stall down the street. This is a virus that would never exist in nature. You would NEVER catch this virus from anybody. Even if you develop antibodies to this strain, so what? This virus does not exist in nature - no-one has this virus to pass to you (except those who are shedding). More importantly, do humans have resistance to this new disease?<br/>
<br/>
This virus was grown in the African green monkey by Merck. That’s the same monkey and the same company that gave us the simian virus #40 which causes brain cancer, and HIV which causes AIDS. Remember that at that time, these two viruses were not discovered in the polio vaccine until long after. After many people had contracted the diseases, reports made, denials issued, and then only did they go back and look. After about a whole decade. So what other viruses might be lurking in there that they haven’t discovered yet?<br/>
<br/>
Well, as it turned out, a lot of children got very sick from the (Rotarix) vaccine. Some got <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intussusception_%28medical_disorder%29">intussusception</a> (the inversion of one portion of the intestine within another - twisted guts, in plain English). The symptoms are the usual after any vaccination - vomiting, abdominal pain, bloody stools, difficulty breathing. When the gut gets twisted up, it can cause a portion of the intestine to die because the blood supply got cut off. The dead part then decomposes, becomes perforated and when faeces leak out into the abdominal cavity, causes sepsis. Some babies died.<br/>
<br/>
After quite a number of babies died - enough to cause concern, which means it’s a pretty high number - the FDA temporarily halted the use of the vaccine in March 2010 and launched an investigation (they only do quality checks AFTER people die, see) and found that <a href="http://www.fda.gov/BiologicsBloodVaccines/Vaccines/ApprovedProducts/ucm212140.htm">the Rotarix vaccine was contaminated with DNA from two porcine [pig] circoviruses</a>: PCV1 and PCV2. “Although PCV1 has not been associated with clinical disease in pigs, PCV2 is a <b>lethal</b> pig virus that causes <b>immune suppression</b> and a serious wasting disease in baby pigs that damages the 
lungs, kidneys, reproductive system, brain and ultimately causes death.” (<a href="http://www.google.com.my/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;ved=0CCEQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvic.org%2Fvaccines-and-diseases%2FRotavirus.aspx&amp;ei=yx-nUITLLYKIrAfFkoFA&amp;usg=AFQjCNFAI9GHnhH58symq5jW3DyCwMQb_Q">Source</a>)<br/>
<br/>
Nonetheless, just two months later, the FDA reinstated the use of the vaccine because they determined that the vaccines “pose no safety risks in humans and concluded that health risks involved did not offset the benefits of the vaccination.” They used the words “no risk” and then “health risks involved” in the same sentence. What do they mean, these damn double-speaking scientists?!!! How do they know that these viruses will not cause disease in humans? They only looked for two months. The SV40 virus didn’t create brain cancer in two months. The HIV virus doesn’t turn into AIDS in two months. So the pig viruses didn’t cause disease in two months, does that mean that the viruses are harmless? What about all those babies whose intestines got all twisted up and died? That was AFTER the vaccine had been approved for sale, remember. No recall, no ban, back to bu$ine$$ as usual.<br/>
<br/>
How did pig viruses get into monkey-human-cow cells anyway? Pig cells were not listed in the list of ingredients. See, I told you they are allowed to not list some ingredients. They are allowed to not list things that are used in the process of making the final product but is not an active ingredient. Like if you buy a can of tuna - it says it contains tuna, water, preservatives, but it doesn’t list mercury. So it’s buyer beware - only self-education can protect you. So what else are they not listing? What other viruses are in the mystery goulash that has not yet been discovered? Will the pig virus and rotavirus combine, swap genes and create a new supervirus? Where on earth would one naturally contract human-cow-pig-hybrid viruses anyway? Just like the pig-human-bird H1N1 virus.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, Dr. Proffit.... How dull and unprofitable life would be without the occasional pandemic wiping out the very young and very old, don’t you think? And then you can come along and save the world with a vaccine made exactly for the new disease that it contains.<br/>

But in case you still think it is better to shoot up your baby with vaccines that can twist his intestines than to let him suffer from diarrhoea, Mother Nature has built in a safety net to stop practises that threaten the survival of the human species - <a href="http://holyhormones.com/mens-health/research-on-unexplained-infertility-pinpoints-high-sperm-dna-damage/">injecting recombinant DNA (new DNA created by combining different animal species) causes infertility</a>. Survival of the fittest, extinction of the unfit! Yeah, that human-pig-cow-monkey-chicken mutant that you call your little darling is unfit to to reproduce and contaminate the gene pool. Kinda like GMO plants - all the seeds are non-viable. The contamination ends with you. Phew for the rest of us! This is how nature eliminates stupids. Well, actually, you are eliminating yourself from the gene pool, which is just fine by me.<br/>

<br/>
Polysorbate is commonly added to psychiatric drugs (medications that enter the brain) because it destroys the blood-brain barrier (a protective layer of cells that keeps toxins out of the brain), allowing the medication to enter, which would normally have been kept out. The brain is a delicate organ which must be protected from all the junk you put into your body. However, a few things can naturally cross this barrier, like alcohol, drugs and heavy metals.

Polysorbate, inflammation and radiation (like from mobile phones) are a few things that damage the blood-brain barrier. When damaged, it allows more toxins to get in. (Learn more about <a href="http://faculty.washington.edu/chudler/bbb.html">the blood-brain barrier and things you do that can damage it</a>.)<br/>

<br/>
Or perhaps you are still thinking, even though more children die from vaccines than from the diseases they are supposed to prevent, I am still worried about preventable diseases killing my child. And indeed you should be worried, because Malaysian kids are a weak lot. Despite living in the land of perpetual sunshine, <a href="http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2458/11/735">70% of Malaysians are deficient in Vitamin D</a>. What does that tell you? 2 out of 3 people have very low immunity. Vitamin D is vital for a strong immune system. Why do you suppose people in temperate countries get more flu in the winter? No sun! Plus everybody covers up from head to toe due to the cold. (Most people here do that due to religion - same effect.) When your body is low on Vitamin D, you succumb to viruses easily, including the viruses in vaccines. Remember, immunity comes from your immune system, not the vaccine. So if your child does not have a strong immune system to begin with, giving him lots of viruses and heavy metals is not going to create immunity. What more when you assault his system with lots of toxins that his immature eliminative organs are unable to cope with. Does your precious prince or princess spend much of their time in air-conditioned nurseries, air-conditioned classrooms or tuition centres, and when they are home, in their air-cond bedrooms doing homework or air-cond living rooms watching tv or playing computer games, and on weekends, in air-cond malls or playing in air-cond indoor jungle gyms where dirty air is recycled around all day with no sun? That’s a sure recipe for sickness. You don’t need vaccines to make them sick, you’re doing a pretty good job all by yourself.<br/>
<br/>
Vitamin D also has an inverse correlation with obesity, glucose metabolism, blood lipids (fats), blood pressure, metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular diseases. That means the lower your Vitamin D levels are, the fatter you are, the more difficult it is for your body to maintain normal blood sugar levels, you have higher blood fats, higher blood pressure, and are on your way to diabetes and heart disease. That describes <i>seventy percent</i> of Malaysians.<br/>
<br/>
What are the three main killer diseases in Malaysia? Diabetes, heart disease and cancer. Are these all completely preventable diseases? Absolutely. Are you doing anything to prevent it? Heck no. Have you cut out white rice, white flour, white sugar, trans fat and red meat from your child’s diet? I don’t think so. Do you and your children exercise outdoors regularly and get a nice tan? If you are like 70% of Malaysians, nope. 40% of Malaysian men smoke. Have you stopped puffing smoke in the faces of your children?<br/>
<br/>
Diabetes, heart disease and cancer kills far more people than measles, mumps, rubella, chickenpox, polio, meningitis, whooping cough, hepatitis, tetanus and tuberculosis <i>combined</i>. <a href="http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2458/11/95">1 in 3 Malaysian children are overweight (half of these are flat out obese)</a>. Diabetes is now an epidemic in Malaysia, <a href="http://thestar.com.my/health/story.asp?file=/2012/7/22/health/11702759&amp;sec=health">increasing at 21% every year</a>. <a href="http://cancer.org.my/learn-about-cancer/about-cancer/">1 in 4 Malaysians will get cancer in their lifetime</a>. Measles? 1 in 18,000. Diabetes, heart disease and cancer - 1 in 3. This is what your child is going to die of, not measles or polio or chickenpox or diarrhoea. If you don’t give a crap about the big killers, why sweat the small stuff? That would be hypocritical, no? Want to avoid measles, hahaha!<br/>

<i>Update:</i> Oh no.. big boo boo! I forgot to count the number of antigens (viruses) in each vaccine! For example, the rotavirus vaccine contains 5 viruses, and the pneumococcal vaccine contains 13, some 23. Why does the number of viruses matter? It’s the difference between fighting off 1 virus versus fighting off 23 viruses simultaneously. The number of shots is just a matter of pain, but it’s the number of viruses you put into your body that is more important. Who will win? Take a gamble.<br/>
<br/>
Also, in March 2012, the US govt had increased their number of mandatory vaccines to <a href="http://vaxtruth.org/2012/02/cdc-recommended-immunization-schedule-2012-birth-through-6-years/">49 vaccines by the age of 6</a>. That comes to a total of 115 viruses. So the virus count for ours should be just a few less than that.<br/>
<br/>
Many people have also asked the same question over and over - what if I don’t vax my child and he gets old diseases like polio and whooping cough? Well then, read these. These are not studies conducted on mice, ya. This is what happens in the real world, to real people. <br/>

Never ever! Why not just share needles with a diseased person? Same thing. You don't know what else is in there. Dead virus vaccines? That does have its merits - one could develop immunity for 2-3 years, but that would mean jabbing yourself with 50 viruses every 2-3 years. I might, IF they make one without mercury, aluminium, formaldehyde, detergents, unknown cancer-causing viruses, unknown bird flu viruses, unknown AIDS viruses, soybean oil, peanut oil, pus from sick people's sores, cells from people's cancerous tumours, monkey cells, cow cells, foetus cells that create auto-immunity, inflammation, eczema, asthma, autism, ADHD, Alzheimer's, cancer... No thanks. Why inject sickness when you can avoid it? The viruses that vaccines cover are but a very small proportion of what's out there. And considering that immunity lasts only 2-3 years, what proportion of society are immune at any given time? Why are those who have lost their immunity not sick? The best protection against disease is good health. If your immune system is strong, you can contract a virus without falling sick. If you are weak, then you would develop the disease. But if you are already weak and take a vaccine, who's to say you won't get the disease from the virus in the needle? Viruses are viruses, no matter how they get into your body. Diseases were not wiped out by vaccines, diseases were already in sharp decline long before vaccines were invented. I'll have to make another post on that. Would I take vaccines in their current form, knowing now what they contain and the diseases they cause? Avoid measles and get autism? Avoid flu and get Alzheimer's? Avoid diarrhoea and get cancer? No thanks. I would rather just avoid them all. Viruses are mainly transmitted via drinking uncooked, contaminated water, not washing hands before eating, having unprotected sex and sharing needles. They are easily avoided if you know how to avoid it. Diseases do not rain down from the sky or are blown over by the wind.<br/></p><span class="comment-actions secondary-text"><span class="item-control blog-admin blog-admin pid-1934159173"><a href="https://www.blogger.com/delete-comment.g?blogID=6557248893718641587&amp;postID=4087473154204691600" target="_self">Delete</a></span></span></div><div class="comment-replies"><div class="comment-thread inline-thread hidden" id="c4087473154204691600-rt"><span class="thread-toggle thread-expanded"><span class="thread-arrow"></span><span class="thread-count"><a href="http://healthbitesonline.blogspot.com/2012/10/malaysian-vaccination-schedule-do-you.html/javascript:;" target="_self">Replies</a></span></span><ol class="thread-chrome thread-expanded" id="c4087473154204691600-ra"><div></div><div class="continue" id="c4087473154204691600-continue"><a class="comment-reply" data-comment-id="4087473154204691600" href="http://healthbitesonline.blogspot.com/2012/10/malaysian-vaccination-schedule-do-you.html/javascript:;" target="_self">Reply</a></div></ol></div></div><div class="comment-replybox-single" id="c4087473154204691600-ce"></div></li></div><div class="continue" id="c191969282986311491-continue"><a class="comment-reply" data-comment-id="191969282986311491" href="http://healthbitesonline.blogspot.com/2012/10/malaysian-vaccination-schedule-do-you.html/javascript:;" target="_self">Reply</a></div></ol></div></div><div class="comment-replybox-single" id="c191969282986311491-ce"></div></li><li class="comment" id="c324498684885705273"><div class="avatar-image-container"><img alt="" src="//resources.blogblog.com/img/blank.gif"/></div><div class="comment-block"><div class="comment-header"><cite class="user">Anonymous</cite><span class="icon user"></span><span class="datetime secondary-text"><a href="http://healthbitesonline.blogspot.com/2012/10/malaysian-vaccination-schedule-do-you.html?showComment=1352996290731#c324498684885705273" rel="nofollow">November 16, 2012 at 12:18 AM</a></span></div><p class="comment-content">Oh please... if you're such an expert on anti-vac, please do write for some esteemed medical journal and have it vetted and cross examined for publications to the medical society!

I've only read a few books and papers here and there, and there is much more that I do not yet understand.<br/><br/>As for doing research and publishing, been there, done that, moved on, no desire to go back to academia. Since you are apparently not familiar with the process of research and publishing, allow me enlighten you. You don't just write a few pages of whatever you like and submit it and they publish it. First, you have to apply for a grant from the government to carry out the research, and you don't do research on what you want, you do research on what THEY want - what they are willing to pay for. And what they dictate is very much influenced by money politics, of which the little person at the bottom of the totem pole has very little say (understatement). Suffice to say, no money will ever be allocated to research on the safety or dangers of vaccines. There are ways around it however, if you know how. For example, instead of doing research on "How vaccines cause brain inflammation", you have to couch it as "Effects of mercury on snail hippocampal cells." If you care to do some research yourself, you would find that there are already loads and loads of such published research papers, each confirming each other's findings, and as such, I find no necessity for me to add more.<br/><br/>As for Andrew Wakefield, he is neither a quack nor a "quake", nor did he retract his paper. Yes, I have read the article in the Times, and I have written to the editor to refute the many factual errors they made in their article, and yes, they published my letter, albeit after being heavily censored. You can read the facts here: <br/><a class="vglnk" href="http://healthbitesonline.blogspot.com/2012/10/dr-wakefields-study-on-mmr-and-autism.html" rel="nofollow"><span>http</span><span>://</span><span>healthbitesonline</span><span>.</span><span>blogspot</span><span>.</span><span>com</span><span>/</span><span>2012</span><span>/</span><span>10</span><span>/</span><span>dr</span><span>-</span><span>wakefields</span><span>-</span><span>study</span><span>-</span><span>on</span><span>-</span><span>mmr</span><span>-</span><span>and</span><span>-</span><span>autism</span><span>.</span><span>html</span></a></p><span class="comment-actions secondary-text"><span class="item-control blog-admin blog-admin pid-1934159173"><a href="https://www.blogger.com/delete-comment.g?blogID=6557248893718641587&amp;postID=5055948412820208955" target="_self">Delete</a></span></span></div><div class="comment-replies"><div class="comment-thread inline-thread hidden" id="c5055948412820208955-rt"><span class="thread-toggle thread-expanded"><span class="thread-arrow"></span><span class="thread-count"><a href="http://healthbitesonline.blogspot.com/2012/10/malaysian-vaccination-schedule-do-you.html/javascript:;" target="_self">Replies</a></span></span><ol class="thread-chrome thread-expanded" id="c5055948412820208955-ra"><div></div><div class="continue" id="c5055948412820208955-continue"><a class="comment-reply" data-comment-id="5055948412820208955" href="http://healthbitesonline.blogspot.com/2012/10/malaysian-vaccination-schedule-do-you.html/javascript:;" target="_self">Reply</a></div></ol></div></div><div class="comment-replybox-single" id="c5055948412820208955-ce"></div></li><li class="comment" id="c6172030087423548341"><div class="avatar-image-container"><img alt="" src="//lh3.googleusercontent.com/zFdxGE77vvD2w5xHy6jkVuElKv-U9_9qLkRYK8OnbDeJPtjSZ82UPq5w6hJ-SA=s35"/></div><div class="comment-block"><div class="comment-header"><cite class="user"><a href="https://www.blogger.com/profile/10236170212680921902" rel="nofollow">Chris Wong</a></cite><span class="icon user"></span><span class="datetime secondary-text"><a href="http://healthbitesonline.blogspot.com/2012/10/malaysian-vaccination-schedule-do-you.html?showComment=1374204724073#c6172030087423548341" rel="nofollow">July 19, 2013 at 11:32 AM</a></span></div><p class="comment-content">Please note, the paper, published by Lancet was retracted as of 2010 "<a class="vglnk" href="http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2810%2960175-4/fulltext#" rel="nofollow"><span>http</span><span>://</span><span>www</span><span>.</span><span>thelancet</span><span>.</span><span>com</span><span>/</span><span>journals</span><span>/</span><span>lancet</span><span>/</span><span>article</span><span>/</span><span>PIIS0140</span><span>-</span><span>6736</span><span>%</span><span>2810</span><span>%</span><span>2960175</span><span>-</span><span>4</span><span>/</span><span>fulltext</span><span>#</span></a>" this is the link to the publishers. Further more Mr Wakefield, as he has been barred from the register by the GMC, was found to have been paid by solicitors representing parents who's children were born with Autism, to FIND EVIDENCE AGAINST VACCINES. £435,643, plus expenses, was the report from the Sunday Times. And I must say. It is unfortunate in this occasion as you are right, but Mr Wakefield sadly simply did just write a few pages of whatever he liked and submitted it and then published it. With such an effort to actually make himself look credible, reminds me much of David Irving (<a class="vglnk" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Irving" rel="nofollow"><span>http</span><span>://</span><span>en</span><span>.</span><span>wikipedia</span><span>.</span><span>org</span><span>/</span><span>wiki</span><span>/</span><span>David</span><span>_</span><span>Irving</span></a>). Such an incredible argument on such a inarguable topic. <br/><br/>Anyway, I find it also disgusting that you question the method that the GMC review cases. The GMC review whether a researcher has broken ETHICAL standards and can be accused of Medical Malpractice, not whether the content of his research was wrong. it was found that the research team was operating without authorisation of an Ethics Committee independent to the GMC, and to remind us all of the GMC ruling, "Andrew Wakefield was found irresponsible by GMC over MMR vaccine scare". <br/><br/>Finally as I doubt it'll have clicked home. The paper WAS RETRACTED. <br/><br/>Thank you. Also, i would love it if you could show me another independent researching institution that has claimed/or claimed then retracted, which is more likely, that the MMR Vaccine causes autism. As the current "evidence" of this link has been, in the mind of i dare say all Medical Professionals, completely destroyed in terms of credibility and content.<br/><br/>P.S.<br/>Whilst Wikipedia is known to be hideously inaccurate at times, Its article on the MMR Vaccine Scare is extremely accurate as each individual major point is directly brought in from a extremely credible source and in most cases, the origin of the information is from direct results of investigation into Mr Wakefield's medical malpractice.</p><span class="comment-actions secondary-text"><span class="item-control

But have you thought about the fact that the child will eventually grow up, mix around, and not to mention the influx of foreign workers and air travel that promotes the crossing of various viruses from more remote areas which are still plagued with diseases which has been long forgotten in the modern world? Then there is always the very real issue of live in helpers who will be mixing with your child once your child goes to childcare or to any playground/play gym. You cant possibly put your child in a bubble all his life. He WILL mix with others. Having your child grow up in fear of germs will really set him back in his life. He cant get into lucrative careers in the medical field for sure. Also with his upbringing of always avoiding germs, he is definitely going to have a socially retarded life. No one likes mixing with someone who is a germaphobic! <br/><br/>Then.. there is the getting old part when his immune system is weakened.. so now, thats when the diseases that he might have caught (and in hibernation) will flare up, or more likely, he will be catching diseases so easily. Then how.<br/><br/>You speak about avoiding the 1% of getting the disease. well. its waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay lower then 1% to be vaccinated and have an adverse and irrecoverable effect. So, check ur facts and your logic. <br/><br/>However, I am not against the anti-vac movement, it does cut out some competition for the rest of us really. usually practiced by not so smart and not so affluent segment of the society, due mostly to mis-information and the general distrust of what they would call - the capitalist world.<br/><br/>Btw, you might want to read up more medical journals on autism..really.</p><span class="comment-actions secondary-text"><a class="comment-reply" data-comment-id="9094749896276453672" href="http://healthbitesonline.blogspot.com/2012/10/malaysian-vaccination-schedule-do-you.html/javascript:;" target="_self">Reply</a><span class="item-control blog-admin blog-admin pid-859972285"><a href="https://www.blogger.com/delete-comment.g?blogID=6557248893718641587&amp;postID=9094749896276453672" target="_self">Delete</a></span></span></div><div class="comment-replies"><div class="comment-thread inline-thread" id="c9094749896276453672-rt"><span class="thread-toggle thread-expanded"><span class="thread-arrow"></span><span class="thread-count"><a href="http://healthbitesonline.blogspot.com/2012/10/malaysian-vaccination-schedule-do-you.html/javascript:;" target="_self">Replies</a></span></span><ol class="thread-chrome thread-expanded" id="c9094749896276453672-ra"><div><li class="comment" id="c3600214911242860060"><div class="avatar-image-container"><img alt="" src="//3.bp.blogspot.com/-gRm8CrY_KBY/TmkGZQl6SyI/AAAAAAAABY4/1hhTxNF3sjs/s35/apple%25252BHB.JPG"/></div><div class="comment-block"><div class="comment-header"><cite class="user"><a href="https://www.blogger.com/profile/18222137373184605217" rel="nofollow">PS</a></cite><span class="icon user blog-author"></span><span class="datetime secondary-text"><a href="http://healthbitesonline.blogspot.com/2012/10/malaysian-vaccination-schedule-do-you.html?showComment=1353063564179#c3600214911242860060" rel="nofollow">November 16, 2012 at 6:59 PM</a></span></div><p class="comment-content">I did not say "not having many sexual partners". The number of partners is irrelevant. I said "don't have unprotected sex with infected people". So you can have unprotected sex with as many uninfected people as you like and you would never catch any disease.<br/><br/>Health care workers in the US are required to take vaccines. I don't know about Malaysia. So that point is moot. Also, any vaccines taken before age 2 does not result in any immunity. Those taken after age 2 may result in immunity for a few years, usually 2 to 10 years, depending on which vaccine, which strain and the condition of your immune system. It is not possible for any 20-year-old to still have immunity from a vaccine virus taken at 2 days old. Only catching the real virus confers lifelong immunity. Otherwise, one needs to be jabbed with everything under the sun every 2 years just to be sure. That is of course again assuming that your body is capable of producing antibodies to that  particular virus. Which gives you immunity to that particular strain of virus only, so say a different strain of the flu or measles virus comes along (viruses mutate all the time), you would get sick anyway.<br/><br/>So considering that most people are walking around with no immunity to anything that they were jabbed with 10-70 years ago, why do you think that almost the entire population (save for 3 year olds) have not already been infected with "long forgotten" diseases? Why have the diseases not come back to claim all the adults who no longer have antibodies to them? Something to ponder...<br/><br/>As for live-in maids who bring diseases from their filthy countries, they are required to undergo a health screening before they are allowed into our country. Unfortunately, due to many corrupt doctors (shock!), they are given a clean bill of health when in fact they carry easily communicable diseases like TB. In this case, you should send the maid for a health checkup yourself, preferably to a non-corrupt doctor. You can also vote to replace the entire Health Ministry and Immigration Department which are corrupt from top to bottom.<br/><br/>The 1% chance of developing the disease after catching the virus - I was referring to polio only. There is a difference between contracting the virus and developing the disease. Anyone can contract a virus due to a momentary lapse in hygiene, but for it to proceed to stage 2 (developing into the full-blown disease) depends on whether your immune system can fight it off or not. And what of diseases for which there are no vaccines? Hepatitis C, D, E, herpes, gonorrhea, malaria, dengue, simian virus, Nipah virus, bird flu, SARS, HPV, HIV? Aren't the ways of avoiding these viruses the same as avoiding the ones in vaccines?<br/><br/>You are right in that the very young and the very old have weaker immune systems, as such, it is also more taxing on their system to subject them to viruses which they might not be able to fight off. Their organs are not functioning at optimum levels either, so it is also harder for them to eliminate the toxins in the vaccines, so they remain in the body to do more damage than it would in a healthy adult in the prime of their life. That is why old people have more diseases - not because they are old, but because a lifetime's worth of toxins and unhealthy diets have caught up with them. If you should desire to take vaccines, it should be taken when you are in top, robust health, never when you have something even as slight as a sniffle. And if you are already in robust health, then what is the need for vaccines? Your immune system will do away with the virus immediately and not let it develop into full-blown disease.<br/></p><span class="comment-actions secondary-text"><span class="item-control blog-admin blog-admin pid-1934159173"><a href="https://www.blogger.com/delete-comment.g?blogID=6557248893718641587&amp;postID=3600214911242860060" target="_self">Delete</a></span></span></div><div class="comment-replies"><div class="comment-thread inline-thread hidden" id="c3600214911242860060-rt"><span class="thread-toggle thread-expanded"><span class="thread-arrow"></span><span class="thread-count"><a href="http://healthbitesonline.blogspot.com/2012/10/malaysian-vaccination-schedule-do-you.html/javascript:;" target="_self">Replies</a></span></span><ol class="thread-chrome thread-expanded" id="c3600214911242860060-ra"><div></div><div class="continue" id="c3600214911242860060-continue"><a class="comment-reply" data-comment-id="3600214911242860060" href="http://healthbitesonline.blogspot.com/2012/10/malaysian-vaccination-schedule-do-you.html/javascript:;" target="_self">Reply</a></div></ol></div></div><div class="comment-replybox-single" id="c3600214911242860060-ce"></div></li></div><div class="continue" id="c9094749896276453672-continue"><a class="comment-reply" data-comment-id="9094749896276453672" href="http://healthbitesonline.blogspot.com/2012/10/malaysian-vaccination-schedule-do-you.html/javascript:;" target="_self">Reply</a></div></ol></div></div><div class="comment-replybox-single" id="c9094749896276453672-ce"></div></li><li class="comment" id="c6917818287768697908"><div class="avatar-image-container"><img alt="" src="//resources.blogblog.com/img/blank.gif"/></div><div class="comment-block"><div class="comment-header"><cite class="user">Nim</cite><span class="icon user"></span><span class="datetime secondary-text"><a href="http://healthbitesonline.blogspot.com/2012/10/malaysian-vaccination-schedule-do-you.html?showComment=1354004740665#c6917818287768697908" rel="nofollow">November 27, 2012 at 4:25 PM</a></span></div><p class="comment-content">Dear author,<br/><br/>Im a mother of 4 months old baby... I gave my baby the BCG and Hep B jabs when he was born. Then at 2nd month we gave him the compulsory ones with additional Rotavirus and pneumococcal vaccine. <br/><br/>Recently i came across articles regarding the dangers of vaccines and i was terrified with the facts that i read regarding the vaccines and dangers! I was google-ing for forum which discuss on this to find out if any Malaysians are aware of this and sadly 99.99% of Malaysians are unaware of it!! The articles I read was U.S and Australian based websites and when i search more to find if it was really true and i encountered more and more discussions on the dangers and side effects.<br/><br/>And finally I came across this article in this website which actually made me feel better and that i am not alone...<br/><br/>Now my question to you is that, what should I do next since i already gave my son some of the vaccine jabs? Should i just stop giving the vaccines right away? Pls advise and i hope more people will be aware of the dangers of these vaccines and get benefitted from this article!<br/><br/>For those who find it difficult to believe, pls do the research yourself on dangers of vaccine and you will be surprised with what you read!</p><span class="comment-actions secondary-text"><a class="comment-reply" data-comment-id="6917818287768697908" href="http://healthbitesonline.blogspot.com/2012/10/malaysian-vaccination-schedule-do-you.html/javascript:;" target="_self">Reply</a><span class="item-control blog-admin blog-admin pid-2115087400"><a href="https://www.blogger.com/delete-comment.g?blogID=6557248893718641587&amp;postID=6917818287768697908" target="_self">Delete</a></span></span></div><div class="comment-replies"><div class="comment-thread inline-thread" id="c6917818287768697908-rt"><span class="thread-toggle thread-expanded"><span class="thread-arrow"></span><span class="thread-count"><a href="http://healthbitesonline.blogspot.com/2012/10/malaysian-vaccination-schedule-do-you.html/javascript:;" target="_self">Replies</a></span></span><ol class="thread-chrome thread-expanded" id="c6917818287768697908-ra"><div><li class="comment" id="c4794425394009902715"><div class="avatar-image-container"><img alt="" src="//3.bp.blogspot.com/-gRm8CrY_KBY/TmkGZQl6SyI/AAAAAAAABY4/1hhTxNF3sjs/s35/apple%25252BHB.JPG"/></div><div class="comment-block"><div class="comment-header"><cite class="user"><a href="https://www.blogger.com/profile/18222137373184605217" rel="nofollow">PS</a></cite><span class="icon user blog-author"></span><span class="datetime secondary-text"><a href="http://healthbitesonline.blogspot.com/2012/10/malaysian-vaccination-schedule-do-you.html?showComment=1354036212253#c4794425394009902715" rel="nofollow">November 28, 2012 at 1:10 AM</a></span></div><p class="comment-content">What's done is done, but you can detox and undo some of the damage.

I was vaccillating on whether to jab my youngest with DTP Hib Polio boosters (he's past 2 and I've been delaying because my eldest has developmental problems caused by vaccines - I suspect). From reading your article, I will not jab him. I was never comfortable with vaccines. But I was also afraid of losing them to the diseases, because I DIDN'T vaccinate. There is a chance of getting them every time we eat out. I can't realistically stay home 24/7. <br/><br/>And I'm not sure I can get my kids' immune systems strong enough to fight off things like Polio - I'm not a healthy eater myself.<br/><br/>I'm really sleepy now (and too tired to hunt - especially since I've read 4 of your articles back to back in the last 30mins) so could I ask you to link me to any of your articles or others' with tips on how to life a vaccine-free and disease-free life? Of course nothing has guarantees, but it would be nice to hear what our options are if we go vaxx free! Since you're living that life with your kids, in the same country as us, I would love to hear it!</p><span class="comment-actions secondary-text"><a class="comment-reply" data-comment-id="5679486737891422783" href="http://healthbitesonline.blogspot.com/2012/10/malaysian-vaccination-schedule-do-you.html/javascript:;" target="_self">Reply</a><span class="item-control blog-admin blog-admin pid-896946110"><a href="https://www.blogger.com/delete-comment.g?blogID=6557248893718641587&amp;postID=5679486737891422783" target="_self">Delete</a></span></span></div><div class="comment-replies"><div class="comment-thread inline-thread" id="c5679486737891422783-rt"><span class="thread-toggle thread-expanded"><span class="thread-arrow"></span><span class="thread-count"><a href="http://healthbitesonline.blogspot.com/2012/10/malaysian-vaccination-schedule-do-you.html/javascript:;" target="_self">Replies</a></span></span><ol class="thread-chrome thread-expanded" id="c5679486737891422783-ra"><div><li class="comment" id="c1027377911044360727"><div class="avatar-image-container"><img alt="" src="//3.bp.blogspot.com/-NZvdD8XySy8/UX566F16gJI/AAAAAAAAAA0/GUBlDgy2syI/s35/apple%25252BHB.JPG"/></div><div class="comment-block"><div class="comment-header"><cite class="user"><a href="https://www.blogger.com/profile/02589715301841900998" rel="nofollow">HBO</a></cite><span class="icon user"></span><span class="datetime secondary-text"><a href="http://healthbitesonline.blogspot.com/2012/10/malaysian-vaccination-schedule-do-you.html?showComment=1367243866506#c1027377911044360727" rel="nofollow">April 29, 2013 at 9:57 PM</a></span></div><p class="comment-content">If you're not sure you can fight off polio, then better not put it directly into your bloodstream, right?

I did ask how many of the casualties were vax kids vs un-vax kids, but didn't get numbers. They said majority of casualties were the unvax kids.  <br/><br/>While your info and logic are extremely sound, I'm scared-lah. I'm a layperson, and don't have the confidence (that a medical professional would) that my kids can fight off the BIG diseases (e.g Polio) if they catch it in the "wild" - since the ones in the vaccines are in their weakened state, and should be easier to fight off (toxic load aside). <br/><br/>Am not arguing with you. Just asking for assurance from your point of view. Please do be gentle.</p><span class="comment-actions secondary-text"><span class="item-control blog-admin blog-admin pid-1905511923"><a href="https://www.blogger.com/delete-comment.g?blogID=6557248893718641587&amp;postID=8579673170782620699" target="_self">Delete</a></span></span></div><div class="comment-replies"><div class="comment-thread inline-thread hidden" id="c8579673170782620699-rt"><span class="thread-toggle thread-expanded"><span class="thread-arrow"></span><span class="thread-count"><a href="http://healthbitesonline.blogspot.com/2012/10/malaysian-vaccination-schedule-do-you.html/javascript:;" target="_self">Replies</a></span></span><ol class="thread-chrome thread-expanded" id="c8579673170782620699-ra"><div></div><div class="continue" id="c8579673170782620699-continue"><a class="comment-reply" data-comment-id="8579673170782620699" href="http://healthbitesonline.blogspot.com/2012/10/malaysian-vaccination-schedule-do-you.html/javascript:;" target="_self">Reply</a></div></ol></div></div><div class="comment-replybox-single" id="c8579673170782620699-ce"></div></li><li class="comment" id="c4266596247463291581"><div class="avatar-image-container"><img alt="" src="//3.bp.blogspot.com/-NZvdD8XySy8/UX566F16gJI/AAAAAAAAAA0/GUBlDgy2syI/s35/apple%25252BHB.JPG"/></div><div class="comment-block"><div class="comment-header"><cite class="user"><a href="https://www.blogger.com/profile/02589715301841900998" rel="nofollow">HBO</a></cite><span class="icon user"></span><span class="datetime secondary-text"><a href="http://healthbitesonline.blogspot.com/2012/10/malaysian-vaccination-schedule-do-you.html?showComment=1368638740357#c4266596247463291581" rel="nofollow">May 16, 2013 at 1:25 AM</a></span></div><p class="comment-content">Here are the figures for the fake MMR scare:<br/><a class="vglnk" href="http://childhealthsafety.wordpress.com/2013/05/03/2013-uk-fake-measles-epidemic/" rel="nofollow"><span>http</span><span>://</span><span>childhealthsafety</span><span>.</span><span>wordpress</span><span>.</span><span>com</span><span>/</span><span>2013</span><span>/</span><span>05</span><span>/</span><span>03</span><span>/</span><span>2013</span><span>-</span><span>uk</span><span>-</span><span>fake</span><span>-</span><span>measles</span><span>-</span><span>epidemic</span><span>/</span></a><br/><br/>So now the question to ask yourself is, "Should I put this much trust in someone who doesn't bother to do any research and just re-vomits junk from the government-controlled media (of any country) and pharmaceutical sales reps, and 50% of whose income comes from vaccines that they are trying very hard to sell me by scaring me with fake figures?"<br/><br/>As to how you should decide, I would advise you to study, study, study until you CONFIDENTLY decide whether to vax or not vax.

asked if you've had a vaccine injured child and is that the reason your so intent on exposing these criminals that are dumbing down the human race. I love your work so much cant say it enough.  The way they make parents feel guilty if they don't vaccinate, but I know for a fact a lot of parents are not vaccinating because they are educating themselves, and I knew that sids were due to vaccination they always pretend that young babies accidentally suffocate themselves in their sleep, but I've watched enough newborns to know that even if you put them on their tummy they will turn their heads to the side for air, I cannot believe these doctors and some poor parents get jailed cause they are to blame for the cause of the babies death, grrrr im so angry with all that's going on.  My son was vaccine injured he became autistic lost his speech, cried night and day, had red cheeks, was a nervous wreck, couldn't understand instructions, couldn't tolerate noise, when I brought him to the dr  the dr said he's a cry baby some babies are like that, ooooh what id like to say to him now that bastard.  Now I have a grand daughter and she has not had one vaccine, guess what she's so healthy, she eats everything including nuts and eggs she only cries if she's hungry or is teething or tired the normal things.  She does not have eczema she's perfect, also by the way my son had bowel problems and had to be admitted into hospital for chronic constipation, I went through hell and back with him, He did chelating with the pads on his feet at night to try to draw out the metals and he stopped having vaccines at 13 months so just the ones that he received up until then was enough to give him a lifetime of woes.  I try to warn new parents just slip in a word here and there, but the backlash from the uneducated is a disgrace.

How the skin acts as our first defense. what people rather accept is,  a needle punturing through your first defense and right to your blood pipe, where logically virus should not be at is the cure to a disease...but honestly I'm from the science field,  just a biotechnologist not a doctor, it took me years to realise and waken from that stupidity...but I realised vaccines to us is like having a castle with super good security but then when someone comes to hand a bomb it is delivered straight to the King's bedroom.<br/>No doubt to some extent vaccines do get their job done via alerting the immune system etc, but your body would have done it anyways without the vaccine if you contracted the disease naturally... minus the toxins<br/>Preventable diseases, prevent it the right way, wash your hands.. boost your immune!<br/>Tq</p><span class="comment-actions secondary-text"><a class="comment-reply" data-comment-id="3187405208675613681" href="http://healthbitesonline.blogspot.com/2012/10/malaysian-vaccination-schedule-do-you.html/javascript:;" target="_self">Reply</a><span class="item-control blog-admin blog-admin pid-1859758393"><a href="https://www.blogger.com/delete-comment.g?blogID=6557248893718641587&amp;postID=3187405208675613681" target="_self">Delete</a></span></span></div><div class="comment-replies"><div class="comment-thread inline-thread hidden" id="c3187405208675613681-rt"><span class="thread-toggle thread-expanded"><span class="thread-arrow"></span><span class="thread-count"><a href="http://healthbitesonline.blogspot.com/2012/10/malaysian-vaccination-schedule-do-you.html/javascript:;" target="_self">Replies</a></span></span><ol class="thread-chrome thread-expanded" id="c3187405208675613681-ra"><div></div><div class="continue" id="c3187405208675613681-continue"><a class="comment-reply" data-comment-id="3187405208675613681" href="http://healthbitesonline.blogspot.com/2012/10/malaysian-vaccination-schedule-do-you.html/javascript:;" target="_self">Reply</a></div></ol></div></div><div class="comment-replybox-single" id="c3187405208675613681-ce"></div></li><li class="comment" id="c4547201721445109552"><div class="avatar-image-container"><img alt="" src="//resources.blogblog.com/img/blank.gif"/></div><div class="comment-block"><div class="comment-header"><cite class="user">Anonymous</cite><span class="icon user"></span><span class="datetime secondary-text"><a href="http://healthbitesonline.blogspot.com/2012/10/malaysian-vaccination-schedule-do-you.html?showComment=1402606815632#c4547201721445109552" rel="nofollow">June 13, 2014 at 5:00 AM</a></span></div><p class="comment-content">Wow.

Just lucky not to be born now.</p><span class="comment-actions secondary-text"><span class="item-control blog-admin blog-admin pid-1934159173"><a href="https://www.blogger.com/delete-comment.g?blogID=6557248893718641587&amp;postID=5114826535413099544" target="_self">Delete</a></span></span></div><div class="comment-replies"><div class="comment-thread inline-thread hidden" id="c5114826535413099544-rt"><span class="thread-toggle thread-expanded"><span class="thread-arrow"></span><span class="thread-count"><a href="http://healthbitesonline.blogspot.com/2012/10/malaysian-vaccination-schedule-do-you.html/javascript:;" target="_self">Replies</a></span></span><ol class="thread-chrome thread-expanded" id="c5114826535413099544-ra"><div></div><div class="continue" id="c5114826535413099544-continue"><a class="comment-reply" data-comment-id="5114826535413099544" href="http://healthbitesonline.blogspot.com/2012/10/malaysian-vaccination-schedule-do-you.html/javascript:;" target="_self">Reply</a></div></ol></div></div><div class="comment-replybox-single" id="c5114826535413099544-ce"></div></li></div><div class="continue" id="c4547201721445109552-continue"><a class="comment-reply" data-comment-id="4547201721445109552" href="http://healthbitesonline.blogspot.com/2012/10/malaysian-vaccination-schedule-do-you.html/javascript:;" target="_self">Reply</a></div></ol></div></div><div class="comment-replybox-single" id="c4547201721445109552-ce"></div></li><li class="comment" id="c3690894861276963145"><div class="avatar-image-container"><img alt="" src="//resources.blogblog.com/img/blank.gif"/></div><div class="comment-block"><div class="comment-header"><cite class="user">Anonymous</cite><span class="icon user"></span><span class="datetime secondary-text"><a href="http://healthbitesonline.blogspot.com/2012/10/malaysian-vaccination-schedule-do-you.html?showComment=1403024572741#c3690894861276963145" rel="nofollow">June 18, 2014 at 1:02 AM</a></span></div><p class="comment-content">Just wait until there is an outbreak of certain diseases, then your children will suffer because of no protection..

During the 1989–1991 U.S. measles outbreaks, 20–40% of the individuals affected had been previously immunized with one to two doses of vaccine. In an October 2011 outbreak in Canada, over 50% of the 98 individuals had received two doses of measles vaccine… Thus, measles outbreaks also occur even among highly vaccinated populations because of primary and secondary vaccine failure, which results in gradually larger pools of susceptible persons and outbreaks once measles is introduced. This leads to a paradoxical situation whereby measles in highly immunized societies occurs primarily among those previously immunized."<br/><br/>- Dr. Gregory Poland, editor-in-chief of "Vaccine" journal, professor of medicine and founder and leader of Mayo Clinic's Vaccine Research Group<br/><br/>"Most Americans born before 1957 experienced measles and have naturally acquired immunity, which allowed women to pass antibodies on to their babies to protect them from measles during the first year of life. Things have definitely changed in the past 60 years. Because vaccine antibodies are different from naturally acquired measles antibodies, young vaccinated moms today cannot give longer lasting naturally acquired measles antibodies to their newborns."<br/><br/>- Dr. Joseph Mercola<br/><br/>"They are not following children long enough to know whether in 3 months, 6 months, 3 years, 6 years, or 10 years, there could be some autoimmune antibody or some immune challenge that happens to the body that lingers or that just sits there as a genotypic effect. There's a change in the genetics, there's a change in the DNA, that doesn't necessarily manifest itself until years later because of other stressors, perhaps even from another vaccine that comes years later. None of those studies have been done, so I don't know how you can say that vaccines are safe."<br/><br/>- Dr. Lawrence Palevsky, paediatrician<br/><br/><a class="vglnk" href="http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2014/06/17/measles-vaccine-failure.aspx" rel="nofollow"><span>http</span><span>://</span><span>articles</span><span>.</span><span>mercola</span><span>.</span><span>com</span><span>/</span><span>sites</span><span>/</span><span>articles</span><span>/</span><span>archive</span><span>/</span><span>2014</span><span>/</span><span>06</span><span>/</span><span>17</span><span>/</span><span>measles</span><span>-</span><span>vaccine</span><span>-</span><span>failure</span><span>.</span><span>aspx</span></a><br/></p><span class="comment-actions secondary-text"><span class="item-control blog-admin blog-admin pid-1934159173"><a href="https://www.blogger.com/delete-comment.g?blogID=6557248893718641587&amp;postID=878893257485606762" target="_self">Delete</a></span></span></div><div class="comment-replies"><div class="comment-thread inline-thread hidden" id="c878893257485606762-rt"><span class="thread-toggle thread-expanded"><span class="thread-arrow"></span><span class="thread-count"><a href="http://healthbitesonline.blogspot.com/2012/10/malaysian-vaccination-schedule-do-you.html/javascript:;" target="_self">Replies</a></span></span><ol class="thread-chrome thread-expanded" id="c878893257485606762-ra"><div></div><div class="continue" id="c878893257485606762-continue"><a class="comment-reply" data-comment-id="878893257485606762" href="http://healthbitesonline.blogspot.com/2012/10/malaysian-vaccination-schedule-do-you.html/javascript:;" target="_self">Reply</a></div></ol></div></div><div class="comment-replybox-single" id="c878893257485606762-ce"></div></li></div><div class="continue" id="c3690894861276963145-continue"><a class="comment-reply" data-comment-id="3690894861276963145" href="http://healthbitesonline.blogspot.com/2012/10/malaysian-vaccination-schedule-do-you.html/javascript:;" target="_self">Reply</a></div></ol></div></div><div class="comment-replybox-single" id="c3690894861276963145-ce"></div></li><li class="comment" id="c1042718632702709496"><div class="avatar-image-container"><img alt="" src="//lh3.googleusercontent.com/zFdxGE77vvD2w5xHy6jkVuElKv-U9_9qLkRYK8OnbDeJPtjSZ82UPq5w6hJ-SA=s35"/></div><div class="comment-block"><div class="comment-header"><cite class="user"><a href="https://www.blogger.com/profile/03569255696053077198" rel="nofollow">David Bricks</a></cite><span class="icon user"></span><span class="datetime secondary-text"><a href="http://healthbitesonline.blogspot.com/2012/10/malaysian-vaccination-schedule-do-you.html?showComment=1404369581959#c1042718632702709496" rel="nofollow">July 3, 2014 at 2:39 PM</a></span></div><p class="comment-content">Hi PS, I had been an ardent vaccine researcher since my son was born. For two full years I read everything under the sun regarding vaccines, all research papers etc etc. I am an engineer by profession and doing research is my forte. I must have read 1000s, but surprisingly only came across your blog yesterday, a local blog concerning the vaccine controversy from my own country!<br/><br/>My conclusion after years of research - Some people are prone to serious adverse reaction from vaccination because their bodies cannot get rid of the toxins/virus/contaminant injected. People who can get rid of it will still suffer (brain cells killed, etc) but less seriously and unnoticeable. There is huge evidence that vaccination causes auto-immuno disease (GBS, diabetes, dementia, arthritis). Vaccinations do not prevent diseases, in fact it will make your body less able to fight off the real disease because it has been programmed incorrectly (google Original Antigenic Sin). Well-nourished children do not benefit from vaccinations at all but suffer the risks. Malnourished children should not get it at all because they will most certainly get damaged by it (google Archie Kalokerinos aborigines).<br/><br/>My first baby had been vaccinated with BCG only. My second had none. They had a few fevers (didn't even see the doctor) but other than that robust and healthy - no antibiotics, no hospitalization, no fever lasting longer than 1.5 days. My son and I had what I believed was pertussis a few weeks ago but we overcame it easily with vitamin C therapy. My 3 month-old didn't even get it probably due to preventive high-dosage vitamin C and breast milk. (Who needs vaccination for pertussis anyway?) Google "make your own lyposomal Vitamin C".<br/><br/>PS, keep up the good work in alerting the masses to DO THEIR OWN RESEARCH, AND DON’T TRUST THEIR DOCTORS. It’s clear 99.99% of doctors out there will just follow their textbook, handbooks, brochures, circulars written by big pharma, had no interest to read other sources, and had every interest to vaccinate your children to buy a new yacht (copy from you :D). I had only successfully influence my immediate family members. Surprisingly people put more effort in researching buying a car/condo than the substance that will be injected into their babies’ bodies. Throughout pregnancy they avoided all car fumes, dirty water, eat nutritious food, only organic eggs, BUT after their babies were born they had no interest in finding out what is to be injected into their bodies (bypassing all detoxification and defense system).<br/><br/>I truly wish more Malaysians are aware of this topic.</p><span class="comment-actions secondary-text"><a class="comment-reply" data-comment-id="1042718632702709496" href="http://healthbitesonline.blogspot.com/2012/10/malaysian-vaccination-schedule-do-you.html/javascript:;" target="_self">Reply</a><span class="item-control blog-admin blog-admin pid-583746618"><a href="https://www.blogger.com/delete-comment.g?blogID=6557248893718641587&amp;postID=1042718632702709496" target="_self">Delete</a></span></span></div><div class="comment-replies"><div class="comment-thread inline-thread hidden" id="c1042718632702709496-rt"><span class="thread-toggle thread-expanded"><span class="thread-arrow"></span><span class="thread-count"><a href="http://healthbitesonline.blogspot.com/2012/10/malaysian-vaccination-schedule-do-you.html/javascript:;" target="_self">Replies</a></span></span><ol class="thread-chrome thread-expanded" id="c1042718632702709496-ra"><div></div><div class="continue" id="c1042718632702709496-continue"><a class="comment-reply" data-comment-id="1042718632702709496" href="http://healthbitesonline.blogspot.com/2012/10/malaysian-vaccination-schedule-do-you.html/javascript:;" target="_self">Reply</a></div></ol></div></div><div class="comment-replybox-single" id="c1042718632702709496-ce"></div></li><li class="comment" id="c6484188985551408446"><div class="avatar-image-container"><img alt="" src="//resources.blogblog.com/img/blank.gif"/></div><div class="comment-block"><div class="comment-header"><cite class="user">Anonymous</cite><span class="icon user"></span><span class="datetime secondary-text"><a href="http://healthbitesonline.blogspot.com/2012/10/malaysian-vaccination-schedule-do-you.html?showComment=1408167931233#c6484188985551408446" rel="nofollow">August 16, 2014 at 1:45 PM</a></span></div><p class="comment-content">Hi HBO,<br/>I can't find the Facebook group you mentioned, can u update the link?<br/>Would really like to get in touch with like minded people. <br/><br/>Thanks</p><span class="comment-actions secondary-text"><a class="comment-reply" data-comment-id="6484188985551408446" href="http://healthbitesonline.blogspot.com/2012/10/malaysian-vaccination-schedule-do-you.html/javascript:;" target="_self">Reply</a><span class="item-control blog-admin blog-admin pid-1970601174"><a href="https://www.blogger.com/delete-comment.g?blogID=6557248893718641587&amp;postID=6484188985551408446" target="_self">Delete</a></span></span></div><div class="comment-replies"><div class="comment-thread inline-thread" id="c6484188985551408446-rt"><span class="thread-toggle thread-expanded"><span class="thread-arrow"></span><span class="thread-count"><a href="http://healthbitesonline.blogspot.com/2012/10/malaysian-vaccination-schedule-do-you.html/javascript:;" target="_self">Replies</a></span></span><ol class="thread-chrome thread-expanded" id="c6484188985551408446-ra"><div><li class="comment" id="c8392480797967201722"><div class="avatar-image-container"><img alt="" src="//3.bp.blogspot.com/-gRm8CrY_KBY/TmkGZQl6SyI/AAAAAAAABY4/1hhTxNF3sjs/s35/apple%25252BHB.JPG"/></div><div class="comment-block"><div class="comment-header"><cite class="user"><a href="https://www.blogger.com/profile/18222137373184605217" rel="nofollow">HBO</a></cite><span class="icon user blog-author"></span><span class="datetime secondary-text"><a href="http://healthbitesonline.blogspot.com/2012/10/malaysian-vaccination-schedule-do-you.html?showComment=1418796895864#c8392480797967201722" rel="nofollow">December 17, 2014 at 2:14 PM</a></span></div><p class="comment-content">The admins have changed the group setting to secret.

If the virus comes your way again, your body will just kill it and you would not get the disease again. If you get measles, mumps or chicken pox the regular way, you will only get it once in your life.<br/><br/>However, if you inject the virus and bypass all the normal immune defenses, immunity lasts only a few years. If the baby is too young and has no immune system yet, no antibodies are produced at all. This is why you see a lot of children who have been vaccinated against measles, chicken pox, meningitis, etc., still get those diseases later.<br/><br/>You can learn more about vaccination and the immune system in this book.

So, you are wrong about getting Hepatitis B through needles only. Other friend of mine has dormant Hepatitis B in his body due to his late father. And he get the injection to ensure his body has protection from Hepatitis B. That part you need to be more educated.<br/><br/>Majority of people seems ok with vaccination. It is a gamble to those who are allergic and have weak defense. For those who refuse to take it also paid the consequences, where their infants lost arm and limbs for not taking vaccination.<br/><br/>I sense your education is a bit lacking. Life is a gamble even you don't want to participate in it.
