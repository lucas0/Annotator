<p><font color="#FFFFFF">A farmer was put into prison though he had mot done 
    anything wrong. One day, he got a letter from his wife.</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">"I am so worried about our farm." She 
    wrote, "It is nearly time to plant potatoes. We have no children. I can't 
    dig all the field by my self."</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">the farmer read the letter and became very sad. 
    "What can I do? he asked himself. Then he had a good idea. He wrote to 
    his wife:" Don't dig the field. This is the place in which my pot of 
    gold is. Don't plant the potatoes until I came home."</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">Now, of course, the prison guards read all the 
    letters which the prisoner wrote and got. They had read the letter form the 
    farmer's wife and now they read the farmer's answer. A few days later, the 
    farmer received another letter from his wife. It said: "Two days ago, 
    about ten men came to our farm and dug all our fields. I can't understand 
    it. It looks as if they were looking for something. What shall I do 
    now?"</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF">The farmer smiled as he read his wife's letter. He wrote 
    to his wife at once. It was very short. "These men have dug our fields. 
    So now you can plant potatoes."</font></p></td>
