        "With a selfish attitude, oneself is important, and others are not
        so important. According to Shantideva's advice, a technique to help in
        turning this attitude around is to imagine- in front of yourself as an
        unbiased observer- your own selfish self on one side and a limited
        number of other beings on the other side- ten, fifty, or a
        hundred.  On one side is your proud, selfish self, and on the other
        side is a group of poor, needy people.  You are, in effect, in the
        middle- as an unbiased, third person.  Now, judge.  Is this
        one, single, selfish person more important?  Or is the group of
        people more important?  Think.  Will you join this side or
        that side?  Naturally, if you are a real human being, your heart
        will go with the group because the number is greater and they are more
        needy.  The other one is just a single person, proud and
        stupid.  Your feeling naturally goes with the group.  By
        thinking in this way, selfishness gradually decreases,<br/>
        and respect of others grows.  This is is the way to practice."<br/>
<br/>
        "If there is love, there is hope to have real families, real
        brotherhood, real equanimity, real peace.  If the love within your
        mind is lost, if you continue to see other beings as enemies, then no
        matter how much knowledge or education you have, no matter how much
        material progress is made, only suffering and confusion will ensue.<br/>
<br/>
        "Human beings will continue to deceive and overpower one
        another.  Basically,<br/>
        everyone exists in the very nature of suffering, so to abuse or mistreat
        each<br/>
        other is futile.  The foundation of all spiritual practice is
        love.  That you<br/>

        economy, and as a result of the great increase in population, our world
        has<br/>
        greatly changed:  it has become much smaller.  However, our
        perceptions have not evolved at the same pace; we continue to cling to
        old national demarcations and the old feelings of 'us' and 'them'. 
        "War seems to be part of the history of humanity.  As we look
        at the situation of our planet in the past, countries, regions and even
        villages were economically independent of one another.  Under those
        circumstances, the destruction of our enemy might have been a victory
        for us.  There was a a relevance to violence and war. 
        However, today we are so interdependent that the concept of war has
        become out dated.  When we face problems or disagreements today, we
        have to arrive at solutions through dialogue.  Dialogue is the only
        appropriate method.  One-sided victory is no longer relevant. 
        We must work to resolve conflicts in a spirit of reconciliation and
        always keep in mind the interests of others.  We cannot destroy our
        neighbors! We cannot ignore their interests!  Doing so would
        ultimately cause us to suffer.  I therefore think that the concept

        turning this attitude around is to imagine- in front of yourself as an

        number of other beings on the other side-ten, fifty, or a hundred. 
        On one side is your proud, selfish self, and on the other side is a
        group of poor, needy people.  You are, in effect, in the middle-as
        an unbiased, third person.  Now, judge.  Is this one, single,
        selfish person more important?  Or is the group of people more
        important?  Think.  Will you join this side or that
        side?  Naturally, if you are a real human being, your heart will go
        with the group because the number is greater and they are more
        needy.  The other one is just a single person, proud and
        stupid.  Your feeling naturally goes with the group.  By

        part, simply reminders in your daily practice.  So, the verses
        look <br/>
        like prayers, but are actually reminders of how to speak, how to
        deal <br/>
        with other problems, other people, things like that in daily
        life.  <br/>
        For example, in my own daily practice, prayer, if I am leisurely, <br/>
        takes about four hours.  Quite long.  For the most part, I
        think my <br/>
        practice is reviewing: compassion, forgiveness, and, of course, <br/>
        shunyata.  Then, in my case, the tantric practices including <br/>
        visualization of death and rebirth.  In my daily practice, the
        deity <br/>
        mandala, deity yoga, and the visualization of death, rebirth, and <br/>

        eight times rebirth.  I am supposed to be preparing for my

        as a higher being who purified himself.  So he has special

        Since I've become a refugee, I have had more opportunity to have <br/>

        and <br/>
        I have gained a much deeper understanding of their value.  As
        a <br/>
        result, my attitude now is that each one is a valid religion. 
        Of <br/>
        course, even from the philosophical viewpoint, I still believe

        Buddhist philosophy is more sophisticated, that it has more
        variety <br/>
        or is more vast, but all other religions still have tremendous <br/>
        benefits or great potential.  So on both bases, I think my

        or fruits of wholesome actions.  So from that point of view, it

        construction, and does not like destruction.  Naturally, every
        action <br/>
        which is destructive is against human nature.  Constructiveness

        and <br/>
        different conditions, people change for the worse, becoming very <br/>
        aggressive.  Likewise we see human beings changing for the
        better, <br/>
        becoming more gentle, kind, and so forth.  This is an indication

        "One great question underlies our experience, whether we think
        about <br/>
        it or not: what is the purpose of life?  From the moment of
        birth <br/>
        every human being wants happiness and does not want
        suffering.  <br/>
        Neither social conditioning nor education nor ideology affects
        this.  <br/>
        &gt;From the very core of our being, we simply desire
        contentment.  <br/>
        Therefore, it is important to discover what will bring about the <br/>
        greatest degree of happiness."<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
        "So from the Buddhist viewpoint, in our daily life we are
        sometimes <br/>
        too sensitive toward minor things.  At the same time, toward
        other <br/>
        major problems that can create long-term consequences, we are not
        so <br/>
        sensitive.  Because of this, we find in the scriptures that
        ordinary <br/>
        people like ourselves are described as childlike or childish. 
        In <br/>
        fact, the term 'jhipa' (Tib. 'byis pa'), or childish, is used in <br/>
        different ways: sometimes it is used in terms of age, which is the <br/>
        conventional usage; sometimes it is used for ordinary sentient <br/>
        beings, as opposed to the Arya beings, the superior beings. 
        Then <br/>
        sometimes it is used to described people who are concerned only
        with <br/>
        affairs of this life and have no interest or regard for the
        affairs <br/>
        of their future life, or life after death.  So, the tendency of
        our <br/>
        childish nature is to take small things too seriously and get
        easily <br/>
        offended, whereas when we are confronted with situations which
        have <br/>
        long-term consequences, we tend to take things less seriously."<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
        "When approaching a technique like the Buddhist training of the
        mind, <br/>
        we must understand and appreciate the complexity of the task we
        are <br/>
        facing.  Buddhist scriptures mention eighty-four thousand types
        of <br/>
        negative and destructive thoughts, which have eighty-four thousand <br/>
        corresponding approaches or antidotes.  It is important not to
        have <br/>
        the unrealistic expectation that somehow, somewhere, we will find
        a <br/>
        single magic key that will help us eradicate all of these <br/>
        negativities.  We need to apply many different methods over a
        long <br/>
        period of time in order to bring lasting results.  Therefore, we
        need <br/>
        great determination and patience.  It is wrong to expect that
        once <br/>
        you start Dharma practice, you'll become enlightened within a
        short <br/>
        period of time, perhaps in one week.  This is unrealistic."<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
        "Cyclic existence means bondage, and liberation means freedom
        from <br/>
        this bondage.  ...[T]he causes of cyclic existence are
        contaminated <br/>
        actions and afflictions.  If the roots of the afflictions are <br/>
        eliminated and if new actions are not 'accumulated', since there
        are <br/>
        no affiliations to activate the predispositions of contaminated <br/>
        actions persisting from the past, the causes of cyclic existence
        have <br/>
        been eliminated.  Then there is freedom from bondage.  Some
        say that <br/>
        as long as one still has mental physical aggregates wrought by
        former <br/>
        contaminated actions and afflictions, one has a nirvana with <br/>
        remainder.  When these no longer remain, there is a nirvana
        without <br/>
        remainder.  'Without remainder' means that there is no remainder
        of <br/>
        mental and physical aggregates wrought by contaminated actions and <br/>
        afflictions, but the continuum of consciousness and the continuum
