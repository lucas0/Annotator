<h1>Title: Foundation</h1>
<h2>Author: Asimov, Isaac</h2>
<pre>	During the 1950's, sci-fi literature resided almost solely in the
pulp magazines that populated printing presses all over the nation.  One
of the best authors of the pulps was Isaac Asimov, and of all the series
of short stories he published therein, the Foundation series stands out as
his greatest.
	Decades after the initial publication of those stories, publishers
grouped Asimov's works into a trilogy, the first book entitled simply
Foundation.  Foundation is a collection of the first four stories in the
series, plus a prologue written by Asimov to accompany these episodes.  
	The basic premise, set out in the prologue and the first episode
is one of a collapsing Galactic Empire, whose corruption and stagnation
over the last few centuries is soon to bring to ruin an empire which
reigned for over 13,000 years.  There is a special group of
mathematicians/psychologists who have created a field known as
psychohistory by which they can predict the actions of a large community
of people induced by varied social, political, and economic factors.
Using this science, the greatest psychohistorian, Hari Seldon, predicts
the fall of the Empire and a period of 30,000 years of barbarism to follow
before the next Imperium rises.  He obtains the unknowing assistance of
the Empire in setting to action his 'Plan', which will allow a new Empire
to rise in a mere 1,000 years.  Thus, a community of people in Seldon's
employ move to distant planet Terminus to establish the First Foundation.
Seldon also promises a Second Foundation "at the other end of the
Galaxy...let's say at Star's End."
	In order for Seldon's Plan to succeed, a strict course must be
followed along the psychohistorical future of the people of Terminus.
In each of the four stories to follow, the population faces a critical
point in that Plan, known as a Seldon Crisis.  The political climate on
Terminus, it's relations with neighbor Kingdoms strong in military might
and recently broken free of the still collapsing Galactic Empire, and the
powers of adventurous Traders and Merchant Princes all play a factor in
the intriguing world Asimov creates.  
	The style of the novel is very enjoyable.  Each episode sets up a
sort of 'problem' over which the reader ponders.  Most of each episode is
taken with dialogue, arguments between the major players in the upcoming
Crisis.  And in the end, an incredibly perceptive (and often devious) man
always manages to see the solution, take control despite apparently
insurmountable odds, and put his name down in history.  You'll find
yourself puzzling over the problem at hand and pulling for the main
character to escape his predicament and come out farther ahead than he
started.  This style of writing is relatively unique in science fiction
and doesn't let the reader even _think_ of setting down the book until the
current episode is finished.
         If you liked Asimov's Robot series, Foundation is a definite
'must-read'.  And for anyone who is tired of lengthy descriptive passages,
look no further.  Asimov, being a scientist as well as a writer, has also
managed to make the scientific operations which go on in the novel
accurate, even by today's standards.  No sci-fi collection is complete
without this novel.
