<small>Updated on 09-21-2001</small><br/>
<br/>
It seems the record label was unable to re-release the "Metropolis 2000" PAL DVD
on September 10th, 2001, as was planned. According to Elektra, the DVD has been delayed
until at least November 5th, 2001 (we are aware that some online stores are mentioning a
release date in late September).<br/>

<a name="3cdpulled"><h3>"Live Scenes From New York" not available at certain stores</h3></a>
<small>Added on 09-13-2001</small><br/>
<br/>
We are still waiting for an official decision and an announcement from the band and label
whether or not "Live Scenes From New York" will be recalled and replaced with a
different cover.<br/>
<br/>
However, certain chains have decided by themselves to not carry the CD with its current
artwork.<br/>
<br/>
CDnow, for instance, has (temporarily) removed "Live Scenes From New York" from
their store. Fortunately, most CDnow pre-orders were already shipped. Anyone who pre-ordered
the album should receive it.<br/>

<a name="nytragedy"><h3>Message from Mike regarding the NYC Tragedy</h3></a>
<small>Added on 09-12-2001</small><br/>
<br/>
Here is a message from Mike Portnoy written on September 11th, 2001:
<blockquote>
We are all OK....<br/>
We began mixing yesterday in NYC and all went home last night after the sessions.<br/>
The only people still in NYC this morning are James and Kevin Shirley who are both OK...<br/>
Our sessions today are obviously cancelled as NYC is sealed shut and we will
return to NYC to continue whenever it re-opens.<br/>
<br/>
In regard to the live album's cover art, I can only say that it is a horrible coincidence
that we obviously could have never forseen. The timing of the release of the CD happening
on the very same day as this tragedy is merely an incredible coincidence. We are currently
in discussions with the label as to whether or not we will recall the CD's and replace them
with a different cover. Obviously, the recovery of everybody's personal lives here in New
York is the first priority<br/>
<br/>
Thank you to all concerned,<br/>
Mike Portnoy<br/>

<small>Added on 07-03-2001</small><br/>
<br/>
Mike Portnoy recently released the following information:
<ul>
<li>Six songs have been recorded for the new Dream Theater studio album.<br/> </li>
<li>Not all of the recorded material will fit on one CD.<br/> </li>
<li>No lyrics were written yet when the band finished recording. The lyrics
will be written during the current break. Once again, most of the lyrics will
be written by Mike Portnoy and John Petrucci, with a possible lyric by John
Myung and James LaBrie.<br/> </li>
<li>John Petrucci and Mike Portnoy will have to write their lyrics while
on the road with G3. Literally the day after the G3 tour ends, the
band will be going back into the studio for three weeks to record the
vocals and do some more overdubs and touch ups.<br/> </li>
<li>When asked for what direction the new album will be going into, Mike Portnoy
said he hates to give descriptions and pigeon-hole things. But if he <b>had</b>
to <b>loosely</b> describe the direction, it would be a cross between
"<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20011024225303/http://dreamtheater.net/disawake.htm">Awake</a>" and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20011024225303/http://dreamtheater.net/dislte.htm">Liquid
Tension Experiment</a>.<br/> </li>
<li>Mike also mentioned that two of the tracks are more experimental,
but he did not elaborate in what ways.<br/> </li>
<li>A European <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20011024225303/http://www.transatlanticweb.com/" target="_new">TransAtlantic</a>
tour is being planned for November 2001.<br/> </li>
<li>There will <b>not</b> be any "Home for the Holidays" shows
this year. The band will be taking a break, so they can spend some
time with their families.<br/> </li>
<li>The new Dream Theater album is scheduled for January 2002, with a
tour starting in Europe in January or February.<br/> </li>
<li>There is <b>no</b> chance "<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20011024225303/http://dreamtheater.net/diswdadu.htm">When Dream And
Day Unite</a>" will ever get properly remixed, since the master tapes
are owned by another label. Also, the overall interest would not warrant the
money spent on this remix (only die-hard fans would be interested).<br/> </li>
<li>Mike Portnoy is planning to release official bootlegs with demos
from "<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20011024225303/http://dreamtheater.net/disawake.htm">Awake</a>" and "<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20011024225303/http://dreamtheater.net/disfii.htm">Falling
Into Infinity</a>", so-called "Making of" CD's, full live concerts and
tour highlights (like the 2000 Fan Club CD). There is also a possibility that the
Majesty demos will get properly remixed for an official bootleg.</li>

<small>Added on 04-26-2001</small><br/>
<br/>
Here is a message from the Dream Theater International Fan Club:<br/>
<br/>
We are aware of the fact that we are losing a lot of credibility with
the heavily delayed Christmas CD. We understand that your patience is
running out and that more and more people are beginning to think of us
as a fan club that is very poorly run. However, we would like to point
out that running a fan club is far more than delivering a CD on time,
all the more because the whole manufacturing process has been out of our
hands. We don't make the CDs ourselves, we are depending on all sorts of
outside companies that are part of the process and had to deal with a
lot of technical problems. Practically all along the way, from the
initial editing, to the mastering, to the printing of the artwork, every
step was soaked in technical problems, that were OUT OF OUR HANDS and
everyone did the upmost to tackle them. There is only so much you can do
and everyone did all of that, believe us. Just look at the delayed Dream
Theater DVD. Is Dream Theater a bad band now because they can't seem to
deliver a DVD on the time they promised? We're sure that everyone who
thinks of us as a poorly run fan club can recall a moment in their lives
when they were faced with something similar, that is, you want something
to be done, but are depending on outside factors that you can only
control until a certain level. And the fact that the members of the
French Fan Club have their CDs already lies simply in the fact that the
CDs were made in France and subsequently have a far shorter delivery
time. Everyone who stayed calm until now: thanks very much for your
patience, it's much appreciated! Everyone who raised the knife: take the
above into consideration....<br/>
<br/>
THE CDS HAVE BEEN SHIPPED TODAY, APRIL 26.....ENJOY THEM!<br/>

<a name="syncproblem"><h3>Warning: Possible problem with some PAL DVD's</h3></a>
<small>Added on 04-11-2001</small><br/>
<br/>
There have been reports from Norway and France that there are synchronization problems with
the PAL version of the "Metropolis 2000" DVD. Apparently, the audio is a slightly
out of synchronization with the video, especially during "Scenes From A Memory".<br/>
<br/>
We do not know if all PAL versions are affected by this problem. <b>It may or may not be
restricted to certain countries.</b><br/>
<br/>
The synchronization problem was one of the errors that caused the release date to be postponed
to April 24th. It seems that someone accidentally used the wrong master for manufacturing some
of the PAL versions. <b>Mike Portnoy corrected and approved the NTSC version, and there is no
problem with the NTSC version at all.</b><br/>
<br/>
If you have already bought a PAL version that has the synchronization problem, please read the
following message from Mike Portnoy:<br/>
<blockquote>
"We are awaiting an "official" word from the label on how they are planning to
proceed...hopefully they will do the right thing by recalling the defective run, refund buyer's
money and reprint a new PAL version from the correct (and Director approved) NTSC master."<br/>
<br/>
"I cannot apologize enough for this ridiculous error and it seems to be typical for the type
of crap I have had to deal with in order to release this DVD *correctly*...believe me, nobody is
more pissed about this than me..."<br/>
<br/>
"The good news is that the NTSC version FUCKING RULES!"<br/>
</blockquote>

Please remember that not all PAL DVD's may have this problem. There is still a chance that it is restricted to
certain countries. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20011024225303/http://www.blackstar.co.uk/scp/id/theater/video/item/7000000061967" target="_top">BlackStar</a>

<small>Added on 02-22-2001</small><br/>
<br/>
Here is a press release from Mike Portnoy about the upcoming
"Metropolis 2000: Scenes From New York" DVD release:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote>
I am extremely sorry to announce that due to errors in the DVD
authoring process, the release date of Metropolis 2000: Scenes
From New York has once again been delayed to April 24th, 2001.<br/>
<br/>
I am furious over these errors which were out of my hands and
I am just as disappointed as any of you in having to wait to
share this great DVD with you all.<br/>
<br/>
I must stress that the delay has absolutely nothing to do with
any errors or dissatisfaction on mine or the record company's
behalf......they were stricly technical errors in the authoring
process which forced me to pull the plug on production until
the errors were corrected.<br/>
<br/>
I know what a disappointment this is, but it will be worth the
wait when the product is finally released in April.....In the
meantime to tide you over, keep an eye on dreamtheater.net in
the coming weeks for an M2000 Trailer to give you all a
sneak preview!<br/>
<br/>
Patiently,<br/>
Mike Portnoy<br/>
<br/>
PS - A very special thanks to all the great, dedicated DT fans
who pre-ordered the DVD and made it #1 at CDnow......We will
let you know when it is available to pre-order once again!<br/>

as well as the 2 "Liquid Tension Experiment" CD's.  Studio time is booked
