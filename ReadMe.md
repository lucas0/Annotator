# Issues to be addressed

## ~~Reset User Database~~

Using ```python manage.py flush```


## ~~Skip ```save_annotation()``` if username has "test" in it~~

## ~~Use shuffled samples dataframe in ```get_least_annotated_page()```~~

Also remember to change the other functions that are called from it

## ~~Remove automatic annotation~~

Instead just call the function again using aPage = none

## Deal with Snopes "Learn More" message width issue

## ~~Replace radio buttons in form with checkboxes~~
