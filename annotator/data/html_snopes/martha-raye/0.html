<p align="center">You are listening to the very familiar sound of
"Taps" as a tribute to Maggie.</p>
<p align="justify">Although Maggie was not actually in the
military, after she died on 19 October 1994 she was buried at Fort Bragg, NC and received an almost complete
military funeral. The only things lacking were the playing of "Taps"
and a squad firing volleys. Members of the Special Forces, the 82nd Airborne, the Special Forces
Association, and  Special Operations Association, along with hundreds of on-lookers were at the
cemetery for her funeral. AND I was among them. </p>
<p align="justify">BUT to liven things up a bit--here you will meet some of the Veterans who knew and loved Maggie.
She served our country well through three wars but you seldom heard about what
she did. Here you can see some of the photos our troops have sent me. Click on the pictures to see them better if you wish.
I will now take you backwards in time--</p>

and Frenchy at the 1988 SFA Convention banquet in Fayetteville, NC. Here is his

of the many men who met Maggie sent me some photos of her that were taken on 11 
September 1971 as she was departing Fort Bragg in Fayetteville, NC. She had been 
there during the 10th Anniversary of the 5th Special Forces Group (Airborne) 
celebration. Standing next to Maggie is her escort--then CPT Duncan "Pete" 
Thompson, now retired COL Thompson still looks just as good and is still a 
chic-magnet. </p>

up is a photo that was donated by Kenneth Roberts. It is one of my favorite photos of
Maggie that was taken in Vietnam.
This truck became well known in the BanMeThout area in 1971. Photo was actually

look forward to receiving more photos from you!</p>

This

<p align="justify">The next two photos are a bit scratchy but still show Maggie's caring for our
troops. These photos were emailed to me by Bob Waller who said they were taken
in late 1968 or early 1969 at the 5th Special Forces Group C-Team Officers Club
in DaNang. The photo on the left includes L-R: USAF FAC LTC Ralph Albright
behind the bar, and unknown soldier smoking, LT Bill Glendenning, Maggie, and LT
Bob Waller. The picture on the right was taken the same night and that's Maggie
next to LT Bob Waller.

<p align="justify">In 
1968 T/SGT Jeffrey Saddlemire had the absolute pleasure of being selected to 
present Maggie with flowers at the end of a USO show. He will never forget 
meeting "what a very sweet lady she was" at Tuy Hoa. He stated that 
"God has a special place in heaven for people like her. Rest in Peace job well 
done Maggie!"</p>

Center (Hill 348), about 40 miles Southwest of DaNang, in 1968 to visit members of the
Americal Division's 3/21 Light Infantry, Company D--a.k.a. Black Death. This
photo was submitted by Robert Boyd Jr. He is standing in the back on the right
and his friend "Beard" is in the front holding his helmet upside down.
Beard's helmet was spotted by Maggie when she saw the words "F*** THE
ARMY" written on it. Click on it to see the whole picture better! Recently 
Larry Henderson wrote saying that the soldier to Maggie's left is Clarence W 
"Chief" Stoneroad from Oklahoma. Larry was working at the time in the bunker at 
the right rear of the photo. He said her visit was greatly appreciated by all 
the guys there.</p>

she saw a soldier, sailor, airman, marine, or coast guardsman without a St

<p>I received the 
following from one of my correspondents:</p>
<meta content="MSHTML 6.00.2900.2802" name="GENERATOR"/>
<font face="Times New Roman" id="role_document" size="3">
<div>
<p align="justify">Subject: "MAGGIE" AKA: LTC Martha Raye</p></div>
<div>
<p align="justify">Like most of the Senior NCO, who roamed Smoke Bomb Hill, 
	I had heard of Maggie, as she was fondly known, by the SF Community, yet I 
	had never met her.</p></div>
<div>
<p align="justify">However, during the New Years Season of December 
	1967-January 1968, ST New Jersey, which I was the One Zero, from FOB1 was on 
	special duty, operating from FOB2, due to the weather in the northern area 
	of operation.</p></div>
<div>
<p align="justify">While there, we learned that Maggie was planning on 
	sharing New Years with us, so we all gathered at the Club and awaited her 
	arrival.  Unlike the majority of the population of the FOB, my choice of 
	alcohol was Smirnoff Vodka.  So, when Maggie walked in I handed her a Vodka 
	on the rocks, and we hit it off right on, except the Lady called me a candy 
	ass for using a mix (7up) with my drink.  Oh well, can't win them all, but 
	we sat there shooting the shit and drinking the best alcohol, until after 
	midnight.  (Regrettably, there were no pictures of Maggie and I because I 
	was still in the old fashioned Spook and SF mode of animosity, so it was by 
	surprise when my picture was taken.  Following this three month trip we 
	returned to FOB1, and in May 1968, I returned to CONUS and a very boring 
	stay on Smoke Bomb Hill, with B Company, 7th SFGA.</p></div>
<div>
<p align="justify">Sometime in August or September, I called Mrs. "A" 
	[see the links page to learn more about this woman]<b> </b>and 
	asked her if she could get me back to FOB1, and she told me that wouldn't be 
	any problem at all, just watch my mail box.  Sometime in September, I 
	received orders assigning me to HHC 5th SFGA, attached to C&amp;C Command, 
	DaNang, RVN for duty with FOB1.  However, upon my arrival at C&amp;C, I was 
	informed that FOB1 had too many E8 on hand, and FOB2 didn't have but one, so 
	that was where I was heading.</p></div>
<div>
<p align="justify">Upon arriving at FOB2, I held various assignments, 
	however, at the peak of the New Year of 1968-69, I was the First Sergeant of 
	the FOB Security Company, and upon notification that Maggie was planning on 
	making an appearance to bring in the New Year with us.  Those who had been 
	there the previous year remembered my encounter, with Maggie and I was 
	advised to "handle it."  Captain Bobby Evens was the Security Company 
	Commander, and we had handled a few items previously, so we was prepared.</p></div>
<div>
<p align="justify">However, come the time that Maggie was supposed to make 
	her appearance, we received a phone call from the 4th ID, which was "down 
	the road a piece."  In the conversation, we learned that she was being held 
	hostage by the Legs at the 4th, so............we dispatched a couple jeeps 
	with .50 caliber guns on them, to return with Maggie, and no one else.  Upon 
	arrival, the MPs at the gate advised that the camp was under shutdown, due 
	to am impending attack by the VC.  The Senior NCO on the gate was asked how 
	he would like to have his gate shot all to shit, and to get the OD down 
	there right away.  Fortunately, none of us wore ID, nor rank, and although 
	these guys knew where we came from they didn't know who we were, so we acted 
	accordingly, and after a few threats, and Maggie telling the Senior Officer 
	in her presence, that she was taking off with us, we departed to the FOB, 
	and continued to party with Maggie.  Bobby and I had a few other encounters 
	with fate, but all in all, this tour was a piece of cake as far as I was 
	concerned, and the second visit with Maggie, was another highlight of my 
	life.</p></div>
<div>
<p align="justify">Back in the states, only this time with B Company, 10th 
	SFGA, Fort Devens, MA, sometime in 1971, I think it was, Post HQs and Group 
	HQs learned that Maggie was to make an appearance at Fort Devens, and wanted 
	to have one of the "Boys from the Tenth" to be her escort, not some leg 
	from Post HQ.  The word was put out to the Company's to find out who knew 
	Maggie........................no one in the Officer Grade, so I expressed my 
	association with Maggie and the Company Sergeant Major said: "OK Ringland, 
	you are the Colonel's escort."  That told me two things, one that I was the 
	only one in the Group that knew or had met Maggie, and two, that the "SMage" 
	had never even seen nor met Maggie.  The first thing that I did was hit the 
	Class VI on the way home and pick up two bottles of Smirnoff to add to the 
	ones already in the cabinet.  Be it far above the Lords in Heaven, Maggie 
	never made the trip.  Shortly prior to her departure from her Team House, in 
	California, Maggie was stricken with one of her several liver/kidney 
	attacks, which, years later led to her demise.  Maggie was, to the best of 
	my knowledge, the God Mother of Special Forces, and Mrs. Billye "Mrs. 'A'" 
	Alexander [see the links page to learn more about this woman], the Special Forces Patriarch Angel.  With one major regret of 
	having never met "Mrs.A," so I'll have to live with the pleasure of having 
	talked with her on the phone.  May both these Ladies who took special 
	interest in we, the wearers of the Girl Scout Beanie, AKA: The Green Beret, 
	rest in peace under the outstretched arms of our Lord God, in Heaven, 
	forever.</p>

CPT Richard J "Griffy" Griffith, USAR was originally from Detroit, MI but now 
lives in Free Soil, MI. In December 1967 he piloted Maggie around from Pleiku to 
Kontum and places in between to visit SF camps. They would go to 2 or 3 camps 
per day and spend the night at the last one of the day. He even recalled that he 
flew Maggie to Saigon where she treated his flight crew to dinner at the 
Myercord Hotel. Griffy was a captain at the time with the 57th Assault 
Helicopter Co in Kontum. He recalls that Maggie could drink and play cards with 
the best of them! Griffy can't recall the names of the folks in these 
photos--maybe you can help him. He does know the LTC was the CO for the SF in II 
Corps in the Central Highlands. The MAJ was his S-2. If you can help identify 
any of the folks in these pictures that he took please let  <a href="http://www.colonelmaggie.com/vets.htm/mailto:nooniefortin@gmail.com">me</a> and <a href="http://www.colonelmaggie.com/vets.htm/mailto:griffy49411@yahoo.com">Griffy</a> know.</p>

photo was taken at A-Team A-412 and shows Maggie with (then) 2LT John W. Carney, 
Jr. a.k.a. Blackjack. According to his son's (Pat Carney) website this is what 
actually happened--</p>
<p align="justify">Martha Raye and John Wayne were both scheduled to arrive 
at Ap Bac at different dates and times according to my father. Martha Raye 
showed up on this day, shortly after the bar had been dedicated at AP BAC, 
Martha arrived. She helicoptered into this small landing pad at A-413Alpha. It 
was somewhere between 10:00AM and 12:00PM. Raye visited for a couple of hours 
then she had to go, it was the afternoon toward 12:00pm that she departed and 
that night was a scheduled classified operation with the Chu Hoi, so everyone 
needed rest. She had come from other camps and left AP BAC for other camps.<br/>
<br/>
Dad had a radio man named "Winfrey". John Wayne radioed in to "Winfrey" who 
handed the radio over the receiver to my father, being the senior officer in 
camp and said over the radio, he was sorry that he couldn't come in; <br/>
<br/>
Wayne: "They wouldn't let me come in there because of Enemy Activity at your 
location." were the words my Dad could recount. Raye had just been there; 
however.<br/>
<br/>
After that, he said the perception was that Martha Raye had more balls than any 
John Wayne would ever. Ap Bac was a hot area recording a high enemy KIA rate for 
the area and time. <br/>
<br/>
Some time after the Raye visit, A-413 or BTT (Binh Tinh Tan), General H. K. 
Johnson, U.S. Army Chief of staff personally came up to see them in Nov 67 for 
Thanksgiving. He came to AP BAC because Stonecipher recorded high KIA numbers 
there and thought it would be good for the General to land there. <br/>
<br/>
Ap Bac (in BTT) was the first time that a US Army Chief of Staff fired an AK47 
and the one of the rare times if not the first that a Lieutenant assumed command 
of an A-Team (Capt O'Toole was killed in action as the previous A-Team Commander 
of A411) We have another photo of my father assisting the General in firing this 
captured weapon. (A-Team: A411 Alpha 2d Lieutenant John W. Carney, Jr.)<br/>

next picture was taken at VungTau, Viet Nam in 1967 around January or February.
Retired COL John "Jay" Baker was assigned to the 535th Troop Carrier
Squadron and their primary mission was to supply Green Beret outposts with
whatever they needed. The Air Force's  C-7A Caribou (formerly the Army
CV-2 ) was the aircraft used for these missions. They also ferried around
USO tour groups including Jonathan Winters, Nancy Sinatra, as well as Martha
Raye to name a few. One of the pilots (AJ Stinson) who was providing Maggie transportation
that day coaxed her into spending a few hours at their contract quarters in VungTau. They had constructed a small Officers Club in the quarters. Jay believes
Maggie really enjoyed the peace and quiet associated with their club. There were
only a few members of the 535th there that day to ask her questions and the guys
provided free drinks. Maggie had brought along her guitarist and she sang a few
songs. One Jay particularly remembers was "Satin Doll." He was a first
lieutenant at the time and felt honored to have had the chance to spend the time
he did with her. In the photo, which was actually taken in the Bong Lai Hotel,
L-R are Don Stallard, Maggie, Jay Baker, Bill Hodge, and AJ Stinson. I'd like to 
thank Jay for allowing me to post his photo here.

Late 
1966 CW4 Dennis Pisseri USAR (Ret) was a sailor onboard the USS <i>Stormes</i> 
(DD-780) when Maggie came onto the ship. He took several photos of her with the

<p> </p>
<p>I received an 
email one day from Art Kidd in Nashua, New Hampshire about his encounter with 
Maggie--here's his story:</p>
<div>
<p align="justify"><span class="624132114-22082006">In 1965/66 I was a 
	Marine Sgt stationed with (a 75 man) Co. L Marine Support Battalion which 
	was located aboard the 8th RRU, Army Security Agency at PhuBai.  Martha Raye 
	had made a local appearance  which, unfortunately, I was not able to 
	attend.  Later that evening, she was a guest in the Officers Club at the 8th 
	RRU.  Now, the officers club just happened to be right next door to the NCO 
	club.  There were some of us Marines sitting around a table enjoying a 
	refreshment when we got to talking about having to miss the show.  So,  
	after a lengthy discussion, four of us decided we should go invite Miss Raye 
	to join us.  We immediately walked to the O'Club where she was sitting on a 
	couch with several of the senior officers from the station.  There was quite 
	a look of shock on everyone's face when we four NCO's appeared. Since I was 
	the designated spokesman for our little group it was left up to me to invite 
	her to join us across the "street" for some talk and refreshments.  We were 
	quite surprised when she immediately jumped up and said "Lets go."  So, she 
	joined us in the NCO club where about 10 of us sat around a little round 
	table and talked for about 2 hours. She was an absolute peach, down to earth 
	and genuinely interested in us.  I was the fortunate one that got to sit 
	right next to her.</span></p></div>
<div>
<p align="justify"><span class="624132114-22082006">The repercussions the 
	next day were well worth the effort and enjoyment we received and no one was 
	regretful.  Needless to say, I have never forgotten that night.</span></p></div>
