him to speak to her husband to pray in the family, wch he 
did, he answered him, ay sr there shall be no want of that,

Bury fair, my grandfather was there and god toucht his heart,

heaven-wards, and followed him to Blakely-chappel while he 
liued, then he needed not be put on to pray in his family, but 
far outstript his wife in religion, and spent much time in 
secret prayer and meditation, of a most sweet louing, louely 
nature full of goodnes, took great care of my mother, whom I 
have heard exceedingly commend him. I have heard her say 
that he hath shut himself in the chamber by great parts of 
days togather, and when she hath gone to call him to dinner 
or supper, he would haue said Ah Alice, thou little knowest 
what hurt thou hast done me, for thou hast robbed me of my 
god, i e by breaking off his communion with him in duty — he 
was in the fields meditating and went about a tree seeking,

An historicall account of the family of my honoured father 
Richard Hey wood of little Leaver in Bolton parish in Lanca- 
shire : begun June 9 1675 



My dear and honoured father Richard Heywood was the 
first borne son of Oliver Heywood, by his 
wife Alice, he was born, as I suppose about 
the year 1596, he had a brother and a sister, 
his sister Mary being lame dyed about 40 
yeares agoe, his brother John is yet aliue, 



[I am informed 
since that my 
grandfather had 
an elder son 
than my father 
called John, but 
dyed young] 



living at an house in little Leaver called the 
Chappel, because it was built of that wood 
that belonged to the chappel at little Leaver- 
hall, he hath been twice marryed, his first 
wife was Isabel the sister of Roger Barlow a good woman, 
who dyed of a sad disease of a cancer in her breast about the 
year 1667, his present wife is Joane the sister of James Mason, 
a young woman, yet he never had child by either of them :

father in the ordinary way of working, and weaving fustions, 
(the trade of that country, though his father was a Carpenter,) 
in processe of time, god sent Mr Hubbert a godly minister to 
Cockey a chappel about a mile distant, by whose preaching 
many were convinced, and converted, it pleased the Lord to 
awaken the heart of my father at that time, and I hope to set 
his feet into the ways of peace, so that ever after that he asso- 
ciated himself with gods people, maintained days and dutys of 
fasting and prayer, conference, and other Christian excercises, 
so that I can remember that in my childhood there was many 
days of that nature in my fathers house, besides the real evi- 
dences he hath given of practicall piety, which I shall occasion-

He marryed my mother Alice Cretchlaw of Longworth in 
Bolton parish about the year, 1615 when he was about the age 
of 19 but my mother was 3 yeares older then he at their 
marriage good Mr Horrocks preacht a nuptiall sermon, after 
their marriage god that intended to build them high, laid 
their foundation low, by first taking from them their first-born 
son, John, when he was but about a year old, then afterwards 
brought them into debt and danger, occasioned by his answer- 
ing anothers debt, wherby he was often forced to skulk in 
holes and flee, they removed one year from his house to the 
walk-mill at water-side, for secrecy and security, but it was a 
sad and afflictiue year, partly for poverty, partly for debt and 
danger, partly for want of godly society, they fared bare, and 
workt hard, and were often put to shifts, but god had mercy 
on them, gaue them more children, made his father kind to 
them, and many other friends whom he raised up beyond ex- 
pectation, and at last the Lord was pleased to disingage and 
extricate them out of troubles, and my father being thrifty 
and carefull, began to make fustions, wch was then a very 
gainfull calling, and after a while god opened a way for his 
trading to London, and raised up friends and brought him 
into acquaintance with one Mr Cotton in Milkstreet, and Mr 
Cary who was Mr Cottons servant and afterwards marryed his 
daughter, these he traded with, many yeares and severall 
others, they got out of debt about the time I was born as I 
have oft heard my mother relate, and god did graciously blesse 
them in matters of the world, so that he grew to a considerable 
estate, and things succeeded comfortably far beyond expecta-

tion, and tis very strange to consider how god increased him 
in the world, even wildest his family was increasing, so that he 
was carryed on to doe much beyond expectation, wch I shall 
briefly touch, 

1 the first thing he did was purchasing the house and land 
where he hues, formerly a tenement for liues, but now land, 
worth about 20li a year, wch cost about 400li — 

2 his building houses, barnes, and severall translations wch 
was very costly, and took much of his mony and estate, 

3 sinking colepits in the land, though very costly, for I may 
say they lay in many hundreds of pounds, and brought little 
profit, 

4 he had 4 daughters whom he marryed and gaue them 601i 
a peece, and something more, and they were well disposed : 

5 maintaining two sons at the University upon his own 
proper charges, (for we had no preferment,) for 4 yeares a 
peece, which could not be lesse then 300li at least, 

6 my eldest and youngest brothers who were some time at 
London, and both wastfull, and lay him in well towards as 
much as we that were trained up schollars, 

7 besides all this he laid out a great deal of mony, upon a 
paper-mill, wch he confesseth cost him 2001i — besides a 
walk-mill, wch cost much to put into frame, though for want 
of use it was presently lost s 

8 He purchased large quantitys of land, wch he hath since 
parted with as followeth, 

1 The walk-mill and land at water-side belonging to it, 
valued at 61i per annum, he made over to me by articles of 
marriage 20 yeares agoe when 1 was first marryed, 

2 Scolcrofts, Partintons, and Richard Leavers wch come to 
lOli per annum, he settled upon me in consideration of 200li 
he had of my first wiues portion, being formerly paid as a rent 
charge out of the whole : now settled on these : 

3 Grundys living my brother Nath: had settled upon him, 
as his portion, paying 301i for * lease in being, it comes to 81i 
a year, 

4 Tong-house and land together with Balchy-medows my 
brother Nath bought of my father and paid him 140li — it 
comes to 7li — 10s a year 

5 Taylours living he let goe to Mr Isaac Ambrose of Ormes- 
kirk for 140li wch he owed him. and tis his for ever, 



22

6 the 4 acres by it he sold to Mr Thomas Boardman for 
Bolton-schoole, worth 5li — a year — 

7 Leadbelters ground he made over to Mr John Stirrup for 
140li owing to him, worth 8li a year, 

8 Hultons-ground, and mason-ground he sold for about 801i 
in order to the paying of debts and severall cottages besides, 
so that the whole by computation of yearly rent or worth it 
which he had in his power comes to aboue 50li a year which 
he hath thus disposed of, besides the land yet in his hands : 

I must confesse it is matter of great admiration to me to 
consider what an estate god gaue my father that he might 
accomplish these workes for the education of his children, and 
for training up my good brother and me at the university, and 
for doing god service in his church, and when he had done 
that work he gaue it him for, tooke it quite from him again : 
his intanglements and troubles in the world returned again 
upon him in his old age, after this manner, whilest my own 
dear mother was living he saw that the fustian-trade failed 
him, and he hauing a walk-mill in his hands, began to haue 
an itching mind to be dealing with wollen-cloath, which was 
an imployment wherin he had not been versed. So he came 
to Ratchdale every munday, bought cloth, got it milled, dressed, 
and sold it at London, he hath often told me, he knew how 
he bought, and how he sold, and was confident he got abun- 
dance of mony, and yet he says also that it went faster then it 
came, he saw it, but could not tell how to help it, for himself 
he hath always been exceeding sparing, provident and forecast- 
ing and witty enough for his calling, yet unawares was cast 
into l,200li debt, which I confesse is the strangest thing 
imaginable, and hath been the wonder of many how it should 
come to passe, But I shal giue my conjectures, and I may so 
guesse upon sufficient grounds from what I know and have 
observed, though I was at a distance, and altogather a stranger 
to his trading, yet these reasons I imagine might be given of 
his bringing into debt : 

1 He sent up to London and imployed there a kinsman they 
call Adam Crompton, (whose mother and my father were 
couzen germanes) who hauing no subsistence, my father to doe 
him a courtesy and for his good disposed of him as factor, and 
he traded for him there many yeares, but spent wastfully of 
my fathers mony, made bad debts, unprofitable bargaines, neg-

lected bills payment, yea (as hath been found out since) ordered 
bills to be paid twice over, and so like a wicked steward did 
wilfully wast his masters goods ; 

2 my eldest brother John, (after my mothers death) kept 
house in the country, and traded upon my fathers account, and 
his wife was very expensiue in her house-keeping, and he 
himself too kind-natur’d (as they call it) abroad, and my 
brother Josiah too prodigal, and cost him a great deal, known 
and unknown to him : and besides all that my brother John 
would needs build a stately barn, of stone, wch cost near 
lOOli — and at dearest hand, out of the stock, 

3 my father himself was grown ancient and not so capable 
of trading as formerly, he often forgot himself, and his busines, 
and therby was prejudiced, not being able to follow his busines 
himself, others were necessarily imployed who proved not so 
faithfull as they should haue been : 

4 I looke principally at the hand of god, and that indeed is 
to be principally owned in this affair, partly for probation, 
partly for punishment, and he is righteous in all, as Job saith 
of his sons, I may say of my dear father and his family, it 
may be we haue sinned and offended god in our hearts, possibly 
my father, my dear and honoured father sinned in changing 
his calling, in too eager pursuit of the world, in unfaithful 
dealing in not keeping his word, in pleasing himself with hopes 
of riches, or imagining a kind of contentment in worldly 
injoyments ; 

However, this I obserue in him and others that when god 
sees persons haue some needful work to doe for god with estates 
god is pleased to lend them to them, but when men aim at the 
gratifying of a covetous design, if god aime them good he 
crosseth them herein : 

My dear father hath been battered with anxious thoughts in 
this perplexing state now this 13 yeares, his captivity hath 
run paralel with ministers, for god commenced a suit against 
him in the year 1662, the same year in wch ministers were 
turned out of their publick-imployment by an act of uniform- 
ity : and there seemes to be a proportion though not in the 
causes, yet in the nature of our sufferings, wherin my father 
hath two sons that haue born their share in this difficult 
province, 1 men haue prosecuted him, and men haue also per- 
secuted us ; 2 we haue been shut out of publick imployment in

gods house, he hath been excluded the injoyment of publick 
ordinances, 3 it hath fallen heavy upon our estates, and this 
providence hath swept away his substance, 4 he hath been 
twice prisoner, so haue many of us ; 5 he fled from his house 
for fear of arrest, so haue we sometimes fled, sometimes been 
punisht, and haue been many times put to fear, and to flight,: 
6 he hath been loaded with vile reproaches, as tis usuall in 
that case, and we haue been exceedingly filled with contempt, 
scorn, slanders, as the only seditious, factious, rebellious 
spirits in the land : 7 his affliction hath been, in a taking him 
off his calling, so hath ours quite cast us out of the workes of 
our heavenly function : 8 his trouble upon that account hath 
had great influence upon many others, not only relations that 
haue deeply shared with him, many ways, but work-folks that 
depended upon him, that are almost beggared, the same may 
be said of ministers, how many haue fallen, by our fall (many 
soules in danger to languish, perish by our being turned out 
of the Lords work) ; and as we haue run paralel in sufferings, 
so I hope in carriage and behaviour, using gods appointed 
meanes for deliverance, he hath had many days of fasting and 
prayer, wherin 1 haue discerned some kindly workings of 
humiliation, and self-condemning confessions, readines to 
justify god in all that is brought upon him, a willingnes to part 
with all he hath to satisfy credi tours, and an use of all honest 
endeavoures to extricate himself out of this labyrinth, and 
indeed he hath parted with all that he can part with, and god 
hath not been wanting in his gracious providences to him as 
wel as to us in our affliction, I must confesse tis matter of 
admiration to me to consider how strangely he hath been 
secured out of prison, in many eminent dangers, and how he 
hath had a way of escape found out in many desperate cases 
past the power of man to help him in, and yet god hath 
brought him off : as 

1 At the first when this busines fell out, being at London, 
when his goods were attacht and himself in danger he could 
doe nothing, and yet owed some hundreds, and some to great 
men as lOOli to Lord Bridgman, afterwards lord keeper, and 
yet by the good hand of god, all these debts in due time satis- 
fied or hansomly compounded, himself delivered, and brought 
to liue quietly at home :

statute of bankrupts agt him wch would have been terrible 
not only to him but to all that he had traded with for a whole 
year, I travelled hard in that busines, and he would not bate 
a farthing of the whole debt viz sevenscore pound ; we settled 
as much land on him as answered the whole — 

3 Ralph Norris in Bolton sued him for James Monilex 
children, and arrested him at water side, a great company of 
women rescued him for wch many of them were indited at the 
sessions for a battery or riot, and a great uproar was in the 
country, but at last we composed it, R: Crompton, and brother 
Whitehead undertaking to pay the debt 30li in 6 yeares, and 
I suffered them to take my rents for that end till the whole 
was run up, and so he was freed : 

4 Though I might mention many, strange providences yet 
I will but mention one more, wch fell out this last year viz 
Anno 1674 : he was arrested at the suit of Robert Harpur, for 
one Thomas Rivington deceased, for 40li carryed to Preston, 
when he was there, one Chadwick and another one Chorton 
clapt writs upon him, wheras he owed not all these one farthing, 
and yet in hazzard he was to goe to Lancaster, and they had 
laid desperate designes agt him, till he with much adoe pro- 
cured strong testimonys and acquittances for payment of two of 
them, and Harper was peremptory, demanding 40li — there 
was no remedy, though there was nothing due from him, if 
any thing was due it was from my brother John wn they were 
not partners, but they hired two fellows to swear positiuely 
that my father had taken it upon himself, but it was a false 
oath, as appeares since, however all was a case it must passe in 
law, and though he had a tryal at the Assizes, yet he was cast 
by these perjured wretches, and so he must either pay the debt 
or goe to prison, or they would fall upon the bonds men, viz 
his two grandchildren Richard Hey wood and William White- 
head, it was a matter of some trouble to us, my advise to him 
was to pay the mony rather then to goe to prison, or endanger 
them by forfeiting the bond, the young men were in little ease, 
so bound, we met about it, my father 

had secured them out of the lOOli to be [this Robert Harpur

about a ruoneth be- But in the interim overtures were made 
fore my father dyed] to Robt Harpur to agree the busines, 
but he was stifle, there was no talking 
to him, he would haue all, and it troubled my father to giue 
him 40li — and owed him nothing at all, 

There was one thing considerable at this time, the Bailiffs 
that were imployed to arrest my father knew not how to ac- 
complish their design, and therfore wrought subtilly, they had 
a pot-companion, one Luther Wood that marryed John Lords 
daughter in Darcy-Leaver, that was constable, at that time, 
thus they had laid their plot that Luther Wood must come to 
my fathers pretending to want a constable-ley, and when 
the door was opened, the Bailiffs must slip in after him and 
arrest my father, and as they contrived it so they effected 
their busines, for after that manner they did treacherously 
apprehend him, and led him away, wch proved an affliction, 
but behold a hand of god, this Luther Wood was catcht stealing 
geese, capons, ducks, and was sent to Mr Hulton of Park a 
justice of peace, who bound him to appear at the Assizes, and 
for his present punishmt ordered him to ride on horseback 
through Bolton with a goose tyed to him, exposed to shame 
and contempt, wch he did, and this was not aboue a moneth 
after he had so treacherously betrayed my father, and then for 
shame, guilt, or fear, ran away out of the country, — 

But to return to my father, whiles he was perplexing his 
thoughts and beating his braines to get this matter composed 
with Harpur, there was one Richard Wats, about Loten-com- 
mon a great tradesman intangled in a troublesom suit at 
London about an account betwixt him and another to the 
value of 4 or 500li — he lookt upon my father as a competent 
witnesse for him, and prevailed with him to goe with him, 
provided him a pretty pacing mare, bore his charges kept him 
well, and he travelled sometimes about 20 miles a day, most of 
his relations knew not of his journey till he sent a letter that 
he was at London : his letter came feb 1 1674, that he was well, 
and kindly entertained, when he was there, my Cozen Nath 
Hulton, (whom my father had sent up to London as his factor, 
and maintained him there, and now is groun a rich man), 
Spake comfortably to him askt him what he would haue done, 
my father told him nothing except he could make an end for 
him with Robt Harpur he answered him, they would compose

that busines, Mr James Leaver (Robt Harpurs uncle, to whom 
he is much obliged) joyned in the same resolution to take off 
Harpurs rage, withall saying Harpur would at London shortly, 
he came up while my father was there, but would not meddle 
with any agreemt, because (as he pretended) the other Executor 
one Hartley of Dean-church was not there, so they referred it 
to Mr Tilsley, and Mr Bradshaw to agree it in the country, 
they met once or twice and could make no end, Harpur would 
haue every farthing, though Mr Tilsley silenced them in 
arguing, Lent assizes approacht, at wch my father must either 
pay or deliver up himself prisoner or forfeit his bond, and so 
insnare his bondsmen, they had another meeting about a day 
or two before the assizes, at wch they struck through sent him 
his bond, released him, but upon wt termes, my father did not 
know, and must never know, but Nath: Hulton cleared him, 
so the matter was comfortably ended, and he had notice, but 
about a day before he was to haue gone, the reason of their 
concealment of this agreemt was because my father was per- 
emptory he would not pay that mony as being none of his debt, 
(whether there was any or no) and was troubled to haue any 
body else pay it, because this Harpur pretends its for the 
fatherles and motherles children of Th: Revingtons, but spends 
it wastfully himself and is in abundance of debt, being dark 
of Bolton could not doe his office but was glad to skulk, 
blessed be god that the good old man is so safely delivered out 
of the hands of such an unreasonable man, I own it as no 
small mercy : 

Thus the Lord hath graciously preserved him in safety, and 
extricated him out of many snares, so that he not only walks 
abroad at liberty, but hath gone to the publick ordinances, he 
[was] at Cockey chappel May 30 1675 wch was the first time 
he hath appeared in church or chappel therabouts this many 
yeares, they hear not of any apparent hazzard, though there are 
some smaller debts not yet paid, but blessed be god they are 
brought into a narrow compasse : 

Though this hath been a sad trouble yet not all the trouble 
that my father hath met with in his pilgrimage, there was 
another antecedent to this that w T as a matter of great vexation, 
though of another nature : in the year 1647 or therabouts the 
Presbiterian government being settled at Bolton the ministers 
Mr John Harpur, and Mr Richard Goodwin, togather with the 



28 



Heyivood Family . 

Eldership made an order, (after examination and approbation 
of the communicants), that every time they were to come to 
the Lords supper every particular communicant should upon 
the friday before fetch a little ticket (as they called it) of lead, 
of the Elders, and shew it to the Elders again in the church 
before they were to receiue the Sacramt, that they might know 
that none but such as were admitted did intrude themselues, 
the Elders also took them of them at that time and they were 
to fetch them agt the next, now my father togather with 
several others, able Christians in the congregation were unwilling 
to submit to this practice, partly because they lookt upon it as 
an innovation, and a snare, partly because, it was cumbersome 
to the communicants, partly because it was an unceartain mean 
to attain the end, as experience testifyed, partly also because 
no other churches in the country used any such practice, these 
and such like reasons he exhibited to the Eldership in writing, 
and in his own practice refused to fetch or shew any such 
ticket when he came to the Sacrament, wherupon they sent for 
him, summoned him to appear before them, he came, and many 
disputes they had, they admonished him, and when he was still 
resolute persisting still in his schisme, as they pleased to call 
it, they suspended him from the Lords supper, but that was 
not sufficient for (as I remember) they did also excommunicate 
him, for contempt, because as they said he laught them to 
scorne, for hauing naturally a smiling countenance, it may be 
he might sometimes smile in his discourses with them, however 
he would not submit himself upon their admonition, nor ac- 
knowledg that he had done wrong, therfore they proceeded, 
my dear mother would haue had him to haue yeelded, for 
peace-sake, the rest, old Robt Crompton, Roger Roscow &amp;c 
(though approving what he did and incouraging him, yet) held 
off and would not appear, so that he was alone in that con- 
troversy, being in this strait, shut out from communion with 
them, he appealed to the classical meeting of ministers and 
elders, where it was debated a considerable time, and though 
the Classes, were unsatisfy ed in the proceedings of the Eldership 
of Bolton agt my father, yet they were loath to censure them, 
only desired them to passe it by and admit him to the supper, 
but when they trifled about it and did nothing, my father made 
an appeal from the Classical presbitery at Bury to the provin- 
cial Assembly at Preston, and after the busines had been 



29 



Reywood Family. 

debated there they made an Order that the congregation all 
Eldership of Bolton should revoke their sentence of Suspension 
of my father from the Lords supper, admit him again into 
fellowship with them, exhorting both sides to a mutual accom- 
modation, &amp;c (and (as I remember), the tickets, the occasion 
of this contention were by this time laid aside ;) when this 
came to the Ministers and Elders of Bolton-church, they some- 
thing stickled at his restauration without his submission, how- 
ever they were bound to obey the order of the provincial 
assembly, and at last framed a paper wch was read in the 
church wherin they freed R Heywood from his suspension, but 
withall made some hints therin as though he had submitted 
himself, which he did not, and so it was not at all satisfactory 
to him, and I think he never joyned with them at the Lords 
supper afterwards but was entertained at Cockey and all places 
about, this is in short an account of that troublesome busines, 
wch was afoot just at that time when I was at Cambridg, and 
I remember when I came into the country in the later end of 
1648 I writ much for him, which was in way of reply to the 
Eldership of Bolton, and some appeales, which I haue now 
forgot, but the controversy was hot begot much bad blood 
many animositys amongst good people in that society, some 
taking one side, others another, so that it became a very heavy 
burden to the spirit of my dear mother, who was all for loue 
and peace, and was willing to haue yeelded to any thing rather 
then haue contended, but he stood upon his oun integrity wch 
he often said he would not remove as long as he lived quoting 
that of Job 27 2 3 4 5 6 : but however it was a great aflictian 
to him, which yet he bore with invincible courage and magna- 
nimity, and was not daunted with any thing, he had severall 
friends to consult with, among wch was Mr Peter Bradshaw 
minister of Cockey who helpt him what he could, and was the 
Scribe of the Classical meeting, Mr Goodwin (now my brother 
in law, then minister of Bolton), was something sharp with 
him, wch he tooke worse because my father was the only man 
that brought him from London into Lancashire and procured 
him a settlement at Cockey after good old Mr Rathbands 
silencing : but these things were long agoe, and forgotten, and 
I hope buryed and forgiven : 

I come now at last to the last Scene of my fathers life, he 
had injoyed his health very well most part of his days, only

when he was at any time sick, he was sore sick and very 
hartles, had been at Leverpool upon busines this winter, he had 
often sd I will goe to my two sons, and be with them, a moneth 
with the one, and another moneth with the other, but put it 
off, my brother Nath: Heywood came about Christmas last and 
stayed near a fortnight on that side, lodged severall nights 
with him, preacht on Lords day in his house, conversed fami- 
liarly with him, and was longer with him (as he told me) then 
he had been this 20 yeares and upwards and was much affected 
in his company, — about this time my father got several 
ministers to spend the Lords day in his oun house in preaching 
and prayer, so that the Lords day before he dyed when he lay 
sick Mr Aspinall preacht in his house, and discoursed, prayed 
with him on that day and on munday-morning, and had good 
satisfaction from him : 

likewise, several moneths before he dyed, he was much drawn 
out with the sense of gods great goodnes to him, and therfore 
appointed several days of solemn thanksgiving, on wch he 
desired the help of Christian friends and neighbours, and was 
much inlarged upon those days, a good man told me that the 
last day he was with him upon that occasion he prayd, and 
praised god with so much affectionatenes and teares as did 
much affect his heart that joyned with him, and others, god 
hauing so signally appeared by his providence to extricate him 
out of those intanglements wherin he had been so long in- 
volved, and setting his feet in a large, that he might goe in 
and act with so much peace and safety — 

;• I ihauing* occasion to 1 - travel into Lancashire, (hauing not 
been there since may&gt;last)‘*to Denton Manchester, came to his 
hfeuse, the place, of :iny birth on feb 22 167G-7 found this my 
d^ar and honoured father sick in his bed, and seeing how he 
was I was surprised with fear and suspected (as it proved) that 
he was sick to death, this being on thursday he had been 
abroad on the rnunday and thought he got some cold, by not 
putting on cloths enow, he had a sore cough and a stopping, 
yet got up much flegme, told me he was wonderfull weak how- 
ever it would be with him, that he was never in that condition 
« beforehand was waiting how it would please the Lord to deal 
with him, I askt him how it was with him as to the state of 
. his soule, he answered. It is now threescore and four or flue 
yeares since god shewed me my woful condition by nature, and

helpt my heart to lay hold on Christ, and though I haue had 
many failings in the course of my life, yet I hope I can say I 
never took my leaue of Jesus Christ : these words so sensibly 
spoken did wonderfully melt my heart, we discoursed further 
about soul-concernmts, and he complained that he had gone 
frequently to private days of fasting and prayer, but carryed a 
very hard, stupid, distracted heart, notwithstanding fair pre- 
tences, that of late god had much withdrawn himself from him 
in secret addresses to him, wch did much trouble him, he sd, in 
my family and with others god doth in some measure assist me 
but I find not his presence by myself as I could desire, and I haue 
been guilty of many sins, but I will stick to my Lord Jesus, and 
lye at his feet, let him doe with me as seemes good in his eyes : 
” We further discoursed of many things that night, and we 
parted, hauing recommended him to god by prayer, and he 
slept much, in the morning when I came to him, I perceived 
sensibly his strength abated, and his memory much failed him, 
he went often over with the same things my necessary occa- 
sions called me home, and I must leaue him, god did indeed 
more then ordinarily assist my heart both in expounding part 
of Job 33 and in praying, both my sisters, and several other 
friends being present, there was a flood of teares and a solemne 
parting, seldome hath my heart been in such a* melting frame, 
reflecting upon his great care of me and prayers for me, when 
I could not pray for myself, with mubh adoe I parted from 
him, came away about 2 or 3 a clock in' the afternoon on friday 
feb 23 lodged at Ratchdal that night, preacht at home on Lords 
day, at John Butterworths on tuesday, at Idle chappel on 
Wednesday, came home on thursday night, immediately after 
came a messenger to acquaint me with his death, wch was that 
morning, march 1 167C-7 friday morning I went back with 
the messenger, found it so, they told me how he dyed, just as 
he foretold, for he often said, he thought he should dye without 
any great sicknes or pain, wch proved so, for he slept quietly 
most of the night-before, and about break of day called for

he opened his mouth twice, as with a Yawning, and breathed

funerals were solemnized, at Bolton, according to the decent 
and orderly custome of the country in attending funerals, my

Mr Tilsley preached the faneral sermon upon 2 tim 1 12 
latter part wch words my sister Ester observing my father fre- 
quently making use of, recommended them to be preacht upon, 
which he did very chearfully, and was ready and resolved to 
giue us his paines, out of respect, as he sd to the old man that 
was gone and to us his sons, the day after I preached at 
Cocky chappel, upon Rev 10 5 that time shal be no longer and 
god graciously inlarged my heart in that work, and 0 that it 
would please him to bring in some soul of our relations to 
stand up in his roome to doe our Lord service. 

on munday I sent to search the Register for his age and 
baptizing, but they could not find it, about 5 or 6 leaues being 
torn out and lost about those yeares wherin his name was 
registred as we imagine, only they found John Hey wood son of 
Oliver Heywood baptized such a day in 1592 wch I perceive 
was his elder brother, and my uncle John Heywood of Chappel 
is 7 yeares yonger then my father so that we guesse his age 
was about 81 or 82 — 

he passed through variety of conditions with such evenes 
and oequanimity of spirit as I haue seldom seen, being not 
lifted up in prosperity beyond meet, nor cast doun in adversity, 
he bore all his troubles with an invincible spirit, god wonder- 
fully upheld his spirit, and I hope sanctifyed his afflictions to 
him for good, and what ever aspersions may be cast upon him, 
this he hath often affirmed, as in gods sight, that he never 
bought pennyworth of goods of any man, but he purposed to 
pay for them ; hower god in his providence sometimes crossed 
him :

8 John Heywood my eldest brother, a tall proper man, red

was intangled in my fathers affaires, with-drew from his own

horses, and that horse I haue kept almost 14 yeares) he went to 
London, and so tooke shipping with Lord Willoughby governer 
of those plantations, I suppose they went to Surrenan or Bar- 
bados, and had their lot of many hundreds of Acres, but he

my mother both for person and piety, upon whom god graciously 
wrought a saving work in her younger days, yet I haue often 
heard my mother say of her, that after the Lord was pleased to 
convert her heart she never had ground to call into question the 
truth of grace in her, she carryed so holily, humbly, oh what 
an affectionate, zealous, loving, close walking Christian was she. 
She had much grace and god put her to the excercise of all she 
had by her multiplyed and aggravated afflictions, of several 
kinds, yet he bore up her heart and she found god gracious, and 
spake good of his name all her days, and dyed in faith Dec 4 
1673 — though she bore 14 children, yet left but 4 living : 

23 Elizabeth Whitehead my brother Whiteheads youngest 
daughter, a pretty, sweet, desirable child, louing and louely 
every way, about 6 yeares of age, had a palpitation of heart,

been careles in his younger days yet when he was marryed,. 
meeting with disappointmts and severall afflictions, in his body, 
relations, estate, it pleased the Lord to set in therwith and its 
verily hoped did savingly work upon his heart, and he lingred 
under much bodily weaknes and dyed March 25 1675

to my dear mother in her childhood, (tho wn she was about 
12 yeares of age she had a sad gathering in her thigh, and tho 
it was cured yet that leg was shorter then the other and she 
was lamish while she lived) her crossenes and perversenes cost 
my dear mother many a sad sigh and tear, and she often fore 
told 6he would dear-buy it before her death, wch indeed she did 
to purpose, for she had great affliction in her husband a great 
part of his time, tho I am persuaded god brought him home at 
last and also her heart by converting grace, then she deeply laid 
to heart her former disobedience and I hope did her good, she 
liued widow about 8 yeares, brought up her 6 children prettily, 
and those are sweet children, her lease of her liuing was expired

Verses made upon the death of those two gracious, now 
glorious saints, whose hues are herafter briefely described : 

Awake ye mournful guests, that doe attend 
the sable herses of beloved saints 
Let tender-hearted mourners passions lend 
and eccho out these mournful sad complaints 
These precious flowers of heaven thus are cropt 
these lilly-saints that never vertue wanted, 

These fruitful vines by death are quickly lopt 
or rather to a better soyle transplanted ; 

Oh saples trees that in gods orchyard stand 
moysten your roots with tears throughout ye land 

Such pleasant Rosebuds that at present were, 
both fresh and useful in their lower station 
And with delightful fruits adorn'd the year 
this year of patience and gods visitation. 

Yea those that did presage a plenteous crop 
of hopeful incomes by their precious seed, 
of fervent prayers, and plenteous teares, doe drop 
and fal apace in this our day of need : 

Both young and old, lament this dreadful losse 
and sadly think of our approaching crosse : 

The worlds foundations reel, and kingdomes shake 
when such strong pillars are removed hence, 
the lord of Hosts doth dreadful vengeance take 
when thus in anger he plucks up the fence : 

When in the graue god hides his hidden ones 
it is because some dreadful storm draws nigh 
When he lifts up the soule and leaues but bones 
those scattered bones unto us thus doe cry. 

Bow down your heads, lament your tottering state 
meet god betimes, for wrath waits at the gate : 

How many precious saints, who hence departed 
of latter years into gods presence-chamber, 
with tender hearts bespoke the brawny-hearted 
in melting language this day to remember : 

Weep not for us, sayd they, succeeding ages 
for safe we are aboue al sins and snares 



40 



Heywood Family. 



Weep for your soules and seed, let these presages 
of saddest woes awake your feares and cares : 
gods presence is with-drawing by degrees, 
and leaues you to condole these obsequys : 

Oh what heart-rouzing preachers haue of late, 
paid natures debt and slept the sleep of death 
What heaven-rending wrestlers changd their state 
loathing to liue when those tune-d out their breath 
Both these fore seeing foggy vapours rising 
from Englands crying crimson provocations 
And heavens thicken with black clouds devising 
to pour upon us doleful desolations 
they stept aside under the gloomy shade 
of death, and there in safety are close laid : 

These savoury quicksented saints espying 
a spiritual famine in this lower region, 

Put otf their flesh, took wings, departed flying 
to feast themselues with the caelestial legion : 
these actiue soules, observ’d a blow preparing 
to slay the witnesses against the beast 
and lest their useles Hues, or deaths, declaring 
what god hath done or wil doe with the rest, 
gaue us the slip and from the stroke wthdrew 
and did a civil death tlierby eschew 

0 what endeared thoughts, and tender care, 
had these beloved female saints to those, 
that spiritual fathers and succesful were, 
soules to beget to christ and truths disclosed 
their armes and hearts were open to embrace, 
gods faithful preachers, and his saving word 
his house they loved, and his beauteous face, 
longing for more injoyments with the lord : 

At best they could but see here through a glasse 
and therfore longd to god by death to passe 

And now they are arrived at their port 
that joyful haven of eternal rest 
those staggering stormes at sea whose bare report 
astonish mortals, these from them are blest

These happy soules are gone aboue the sun 
yea glorious suns are in heavens firmament 
no sun-light need they, glory is begun, 
grace perfect is, god is their sole content : 
o let us hasten to these blessed joys 
and leaue our sins, and loads, and worldly toys. 

per me 0 H 

The life of Alice Heywood, my dear and precious mother, 
observed and collected by 0 H 

She was born in Longworth near Walmesley chappel in Bolton 
parish in Lane: about the year 1594: she was the onely 
daughter of her father, she had four brothers, William, Francis, 
Hugh, and Ralph Critch-law, and most of these being effectu- 
ally wrought upon by grace while she was but yong she wondered 
at their zeal, and could not imagine what ailed them to keep 
such a stirre in praying, reading, and runing to sermons, &amp;c 
Yet she liked them the better for their forwardnes in these ways 
of god and dutys of religion, tho she had little sense of these 
things as yet upon her own heart, for (as she hath often told 
me) she was as careles, carnal, and fro ward as any til she was 
about 19 years of age, at which time it pleased god to take to 
himselfe her gracious mother, whom she tenderly affected, and 
for whose death she made excessiue sorrow, well heart-breaking 
providence was seconded with an heart-convincing ordinance, 
and with gods blessing upon both, for at that time there lived 
a godly young minister at the place, one Mr Joshua Hill, whom 
the lord used as an instrument to open her blind eyes, to con- 
vince her heart of her dangerous estate by nature, and the 
dreadful guilt attending the commission of every actual sin, so 
that her heart was overwhelmed under sad apprehensions of 
divine wrath, she even roared by reason of the disquietnes of 
her spirit, oh the bitter pangs and torturing throws her soule 
felt in this spiritual travel, her very moysture was drved up 
with bitternes of soule, in wch selfe-lamenting plight (at the 
next door to despair) she continued too ful years, stil suffering 
gods terrours, and refusing to be comforted, thinking her con- 
dition without paralel, and far worse then ever any bodys else 
was, and that ther was no hopes of mercy for so vile a sinner 
And that wch lay very heavy upon her heart was that she had 
not been so careful to follow her dear, dead mothers example 



42 



Heywood Family . 



and instructions, for the things of her soule, tho she was very 
observant to please her in other things: it broke her heart 
exceedingly that her mother was gone to the graue with tears 
for her, and had not seen the return of her prayers and successe 
of her endeavours for her conversion : there were indeed many 
concentring causes of her excessiue soul-trouble, the sin of her 
nature, and the vile nature of her sins, therby dishonouring 
god, crucifying christ, grieving the spirit, and undoing her 
soule : and many aggravating circumstances that brought her 
soul to the gates of hel, and her body nigh unto the graue : 
one passage I haue often heard her relate that upon that day 
upon wch she used to goe to Bolton, and be most jocund with 
her companions, she did afterwards with-draw her selfe into a 
little out-house near her fathers, and took her bible with her 
and spent the whole day in reading and praying, self-examining 
and selfe-judging excercises, there she took her fil in bitter crys 
of godly sorrow, and hearty groanes for pardoning mercy, that 
fasting and solitarines being an holy revenge upon 
2 cor 7 11] her selfe for her former mirth and vanity, though 
she had not been addicted to grosse prophanes, yet 
youthful wantones was her bitter affliction ; for a wounded 
spirit hath a fruitful fancy to multiply and magnify smallest 
circumstances, and render them intolerable : when her Brothers 
perceived her continuing too long in that little coat, some of 
them came to take her off and bring her home, telling her, she 
must pitty her body, and that god wil haue mercy and not 
sacrifice, she answered she cared not wt became of her body, so 
her heart might be laid low enough for sin : 

Her soul-troubles were so great, and her doubts so many that 
several experienced persons took great pains to comfort her, but 
almost in vain, Mr Hill who was the means of her casting down 
laboured much to raise her up, lest she should be swallowed up 
with over-much sorrow he had a tender respect to her, and 
sometimes in company would haue pointed to her and said, this 
is one of my lambes, wch expression wrought wonderfully upon 
her heart, Ah thought she, what am I that any of gods messen- 
gers should own such an unworthy wretch that I should be 
called a lamb that am liker a wolfe, and deserue not to come 
into christs fold among his people ; many selfe-abasing and 
self-condemning thoughts she had, and was nothing in her 
owne eyes, and if she perceived that any thought or spoke we!

of her it did rather humble her then lift her up, yea it did the 
rather break her heart, because she thought she was not so good 
as they took her to be ; and if they knew how vile she was they 
would not praise her, for none had so bad an heart as she was 
burdened with : 

Amongst others of her spiritual helps her brothers contributed 
much, especially her youngest brother (Ralph) was more en- 
deared to her through suitablenes in age, but especially in 
soule-troubles for he also was wrought upon about the same 
time, and too precious gentlewomen living near, were her com- 
panions in this soul-tribulation (who afterwards were Mtris 
Barton and Ms Crosse) whose loue and friendship continued 
with much tendernes til death though removed far asunder : 

Another singular assistant to her in her soule-troubles was 
that auncient and eminent servant of god James Horrocks, 
whose advice in those days was as an oracle, and the lord bless- 
ing him for abundance of good to many soules. She complained 
of back-wardnes to duty and that she came so unwillingly to 
god sometimes that she had better let all alone, for god loues 
chearful worshippers : this he satisfyed by telling her it was a 
state incident to the best of gods children, and could she expect 
to be better then David, who said, since then o lord 1 forget 
my selfe (as tis in the meeter, and as he quoted it) : and that 
this is but the struggling of the flesh agt the spirit, wch cannot 
be conquered by yeelding but by fighting, and god wil own in 
and crown the soul after the combate &amp;c 

But tho she was sensible of her inward backwardnes, yet 
that good old man took notice of her outward forwardnes in 
dutys of religion, and he used to say, Alice, thou art mad, this 
wil not last long, the fire-edge will soon be taken off, thou art 
just like one that hath been long in prison, who when he is got 
out, cares not which way he runs so he get far and fast enough 
from his old prison, or like a man yt hath been long in darknes, 
and coming into light he admires at it, and lookes on himselfe 
as in a new world ; just so art thou, looking upon thy condition 
as strange and uncouth but after a while we shal see thee more 
sober and solid lesse fiery and passionate, tho indeed she main- 
tained a wel-tempered zeal al her days, however she might part 
with that froth and frolick that might be incident to youthful 
zeale. Yet that true spiritual force was not abated but increased 
in age : she kept aliue that coale of zeale and maintained a 



44 



Heywood Family . 



constant tenure of savour and fervour of spirit, suffering as few 
decays and eclipses as most doe of so long a profession : I haue 
often heard her say, that after the lord gaue her assurance she 
never lost it, but had some degrees therof, tho not always equal 
comfort or confidence, and tho this may be an arbitrary act of 
free grace, yet it may be the privilege of close-walkers, 
for peace is upon them that walk according to the rule [gal 6 
of the new creature : 

The first time her wavering soule got any anchor or satisfac- 
tion after these tempestuous tossings was at and by meanes of 
a sermon preached upon that text, cant 2 16 my beloved is 
mine, and I am his, wch text her soule was exceedingly affected 
with, and desired it might be preacht upon at her funeral, or 
that in psal 42 5, why art thou cast downe — which also she took 
great pleasure in, for she used often to bespeak her own heart 
in the language of that text, and receiue comfort therby in al 
her soul-conflicts, and outward pressures, al her days : these too 
scriptures she injoyned my brother and me to preach upon, (for 
she ingaged us to preach togather at Cockey every year a day 
while she lived) and whiles we were preparing and purposing to 
preach on those subjects the lord removed her hence, yet we 
kept our promises and performed our resolutions, and shall doe 
whiles we Hue if the lord grannt oppertunity and restore our 
libertys. this I can say, through gods mercy, yt having spent 
many serious thoughts upon both those texts, I haue seldome 
met with so much inlargement in preparation and delivering 
the matter I intended thereupon, as upon those subjects, both 
to my own satisfaction and (I hope) others edification : 

But to returne to my relation, when the lord had thus 
betrothed and maryed my dear mother to himselfe in righteous- 
nes, judgement loving-kindnes and mercys, he provided for her 
a suitable husband, my dear and honoured father, of whose 
piety and sincerity she had undoubted evidence, she hath often 
said that was the principal end of her choyce, and her heart 
was more endeared to him as an heir of the same grace of life, 
then for any other endowments : they were contracted first and 
then maryed (as I remember I haue heard them say) by good 
old Mr Horrocks, that famous light and precious instrument of 
god, to whom she had an endeared affection : 

But no sooner was she linked in that relation and ingaged in 
the world, but behold a Gad, a troop, yea an army of troubles

broke in and assaulted her, the lord seeing good to cast her 
down first that he might raise her np, as he dealt with her in 
spirituals so in outwards, intending to raise a great structure 
and fabriek of blessings in matters of this life and a better, he 
laid the foundation low in inward perplexitys and outward 
miserys : One of the first encounters she met with was the 

death of her first-born son, wch how great an 
affliction it was let experience and scripture tes- [zach 12 10 
tify : yet this was but the beginning of her 
troubles, for the lord excercised them under that distracting 
and heart-breaking providence of debt and danger thereby, 
occasioned by my fathers ingagement in a way of sureti-ship 
for others and this brought them very low, by suits and pur- 
suits, to take the advantage against them : besides, at the same 
time there lay a very grievous famine upon at the countrey 
what her pressures were, and sad thoughts of heart in those 
days cannot easily be expressed, tho she hath pathetically related 
them to me, and kept a due sense of those troubles 
upon her heart al her days, that her soule might [lam 3 19 20 
be humbled within her in al her future prosper- 
ous condition : 

In these straits the lord raised up for them many Christian 
friends, whose hearts were moved to be very tender and affec- 
tionate towards them, and were very instrumental for their 
comfort and incouragement : amongst wm I haue often heard 
her own her father in-law, my grandfather (after whose name 
I was called) as a special means of her support, he was indeed 
eminent for godlines, tho converted when he was at least 60 
years of age, and hee was as amiable for natural disposition, for 
he was made up of loue as I haue heard her often say, he often 
spoke lovingly to her, and acted the pa.rt of a faithful friend in 
strengthening her hands in god, helping her as if she had been 
his owne onely child, telling her that he and she would be 
equal sharers in comforts and crosses, and whitest he had it she 
should not want it : But at length the lord took away this 

stay also, removing him by death to himselfe who was so great 
an help to her, yet about the same time the lord did also remoue 
that affliction, and did graciously deliver them out of the snare 
and did set their feet in a safe and large place, in that year 
wherin I was born (as I haue heard her often say) were they 
freed from debt, and afterwards by the lords blessing did abun-

dantly increase in the world, and did grow to a very good estate 
in the world, affording us children a liberal education, and tho 
these be but left-hand blessings yet deserue to be observed and 
recorded to the glory of god, and the incouragement of god- 
fearing soules : besides tis a more blessed thing to giue then to 
receiue, and oh how good are these mercys with a blessing. 

Tho god delivered out of these straits yet she was a woman 
of sorrows, wch she bore with invincible courage, and incredible 
patience, chearfnlnes and selfe-denyal, for she had a speedy 
remedy for every malady, and that was prayer, oftentimes, when 
her heart was as ful of cares and fears as it could hold, and she 
was ready to be swallowed up, she was wont to goe to the lord 
and open her case and state to him in secret prayer and therby 
found present ease and future successe, and she was very conver- 
sant with the lord alone in holy, humble retirements, selfe-con- 
ference, meditation, and recollecting sermons (wch she heard :) 
and working them upon her own heart, wherby she had attained 
to a notable faculty in remembring, for tho by age her natural 
memory was decayed, and she was not expert in the art of 
memory yet she had the spirit of remembrance, and would 
mention much of what she had heard many years before ; it 
was her constant course in the night when she lay waking to 
roll them in her mind, and rivet them there, so that in her I 
haue often observed the truth of that maxime, a good heart 
helpes a bad memory : 

She was exceeding frequent and fervent in secret prayer, she 
took it as her greatest delight and recreation when she could 
get alone and poure out her soule before the lord, nor was this 
a bare formal performance meerly to satisfy the clamours of an 
anxious conscience, but it was her meat and drink, eating ashes 
as it were like bread and mingling her drink with teares, for 
her soules nourishment and refreshment, she did (as 
Heb 5 7] her sweet saviour before her) offer up prayers and 
supplications, with strong crying and teares : — her 
prayers were wel rooted in a right principle, wel regulated 
according to the rule, wel watered with many tears, and wel 
preferred through the merits of a saviour, and they were abun- 
dantly answered with a sweet and satisfying return, she begged 
grace principally for her children and god let her see that good 
work upon several of them, she much desired that some at least 
of the fruit of her body might be dedicated to the service of

the sanctuary, and she saw too of us preachers, and her main 
end in desiring this good work for us was that we might be 
instruments to bring soules to cht. she hath often said, oh where 
shal I put my head when my sons goe up into the pulpit to 
preach ? How unworthy am I of this high honour? if they 
may doe god any service it is a greater honour then if they had 
been the greatest princes upon earth : she often begged too 
things of god for us, viz the gifts and graces of his spirit, and 
a successe of our labours : How many fervent prayers hath she 
put up for this poore congregation of Coley, and what good 
hath been done by this worthies worme, I owne as a returne of 
her prayers : One passage I cannot but obserue, and remember 

whiles I Hue. At one time upon a lords day in the afternoon 
I found a fill tide of more then ordinary inlargements in 
publick, the week after going into Lane : I askt her if she did 
not keep house the lords day before, and upon further inquiry 
I haue found that at that instant of my assistance she was 
before the lord in secret, tis true I must own the intercession 
of christ alone as onely meritarious, yet this to me is an experi- 
ment that the effectual fervent piayer of a righteous person 
availes much : 

She intirely loved al godly ministers, and accounted their 
feet beautifull that brought the glad-tidings of the gospel of 
peace, she would haue put them in her bosome, and was even 
ravisht wn any of the lords embassadours came under her roofe, 
an oppertunitv of serving them or entertaining such, was more 
worth to her then great worldly gaines, I haue often heard her 
say that every bit of meat wch a good minister eat at her table 
she thought nourisht her ; and as she did Reverence them, so 
they respected her she had a friendly correspondence wth the 
best ministers in the country, who were ordinarily willing to 
condescend to her request for preaching, which good excercises 
she was very forward to promote, she had prevailed with my 
father Angier and Mr Gee for their pains at Bolton or Cockey, 
wch was done some time before their death and the summer 
after : her heart was so endeared to godly ministers, that she 
hath admired at gods free-grace that vouch-safed to dignify her 
seed with that office, especially having approbation and ordina- 
tion by ministers to that work in a regular way : and for her 
loue to, care of, and prevalency with ministers a Reverend 
divine used to cal her the mother of the Clergy :

Her earnest desire and constant care was to wait at the posts 
of wisdome She hath in her time taken intolerable paines to 
hear sermons, scarce any publick excercise stated or occasional 
within many miles but she went to it, she was (as it were) the 
center of news for knowing the time and place of week-days 
sermons, she thought it a great affliction to misse of any oppor- 
tunity for the good of her soule, she moved in dutys and ordi- 
nances as in her proper element, and hath often said, she was 
never right, but when she was reading, or hearing, or praying, 
or meditating or conferring, she loved to breath in a religious 
aire, and thought she could never be weary of gods service, 
there was scarce ever a week wherin she spent not one day or 
more in the communion of saints, those of her own sex keeping 
up appointed seasons of conference, and private fasts, in days 
of private meeting for humiliation she was conversant not onely 
about home but several adjacent parishes abroad, where she had 
very many intimate associates, who dearly loved her and were 
as affectionately embraced by her, she might truely say yt she 
was a companion to al those that feared god, for she had the 
right hand of fellowship in many churches, and her praise was 
in the gospel far and near : 

She was exceeding pitiful and tender-hearted to the poore, 
and used not onely to deal her bread but poure 
isai 58 7 10] out her soul to the hungry, many a time hath 
she given money, cloaths, victuals to such as 
were in want, and what else was for their supply, she often pre- 
vailed with my father for work for poore persons in a time of 
scarcity when others cast them off, tho to his apparent damage 
and disadvantage, How generally she was beloved of the poore 
that bitter lamentation from house to house at the news of her 
death is a sufficient witnes ; wch sounds in the ears of some 
even to this very day : 

But besides mercy to their bodys, she had great compassion 
of their soules, examining, instructing, admonishing poore ig- 
norant sottish creatures : it was her usual practice to help many 
poore children to learning, by buying them bookes, setting them 
to schoole, and paying their masters for teaching, wherby many 
a poore parent blessed god for help by their childrens reading 
who formerly were deprived of that benefit : 

She laid to her heart very heavily the sins and sufferings of 
others, the dishonour of god was the burden of her soule, like 



49 



Beywood Family . 

good Lot, David, Jeremiah she beheld transgressors and was 
grieved, when any scandal broke out among professors, what 
sorrow did posesse her ; in those cases wherin she hath been 
concerned she hath been more grieved for others fault then her 
own losse, pitying such as haue couzened her, and begging 
pardon of their sin : She put under her shoulder to bear the 

burdens of the afflicted, oh her sympathizing groans and im- 
portunate prayers for afflicted soules, that were under desertions 
temptations, or discouragements, she made every ones condition 
as her owne, and put on such as were able to helpe them that 
suffered. She used to be the poores purveyer and caterer, and 
to beg reliefe of such as were able when the case did require it, 
and bringing tempted soules into acquaintance with ministers 
or able Christians by whom they might be satisfyed and edifyed, 
and provoking them to good works ; and charity to soules and 
bodys ; 

She was wonderfully caryed out in desiring and endeavouring 
the good of the church, many an importunate prayer and affec- 
tionate tear did she groane out for the good of zion, she evi- 
denced her selfe to be a real member of christs mistical body, 
and a tender-hearted daughter of Jerusalem by this divine 
sympathy, the troubles of the ancient Non-conformists under 
the prelates in former times went near her heart, and stirred up 
her extraordinary crys for inlargement, and what Respite we 
haue had from that spiritual thraldome (I am persuaded) was a 
returne of her prayers amongst the rest. She was indeed an 
unreconcileable enemy to the Bishops government, and she did 
confidently beleeue she must see their down-fal, many years 
before they came downe, wch she frequently repeated to a 
kinsman, who was a minister, and of that judgment, who 
wondered to hear her so peremptory. She was much rejoyced 
at the calling, confirming, and successe of the Parliament in 
41 : at the taking of the covenant, and any beginnings of 
Reformation, and having obtained leaue of officers shewed her 
forwardnes in demolishing the relicks of superstition : She did 

recount and cause to be written fair over a great number of 
the national mercys and admirable deliverances, to excite 
present thankfulnes, and to be a memorial to succeeding ages : 

She was exceeding desirous and industrious (to her power, 
and in her sphear) to procure a settlement of godly ministers 
in places adjacent, the very last day she was at Bolton, and the

last work she did in Lancashire was bestirring her-selfe tooth 
and naile to bring a good man to Cockey, for wch end she pro- 
cured a meeting of ministers and some of the people to consult 
about it, wch was the onely means to accomplish that end. for 
good motions often proue abortiue for want of a mutual har- 
mony, tho the individual persons be forward enough if taken 
dividedly, now this mutual concurrence was her great designe 
either for reconciling differing partys, or for accomplishing 
publick enterprizes : by meeting togather and treating : 

She was very useful in reconciling differences, and making 
up breaches, taking much paines. yet great delight in that 
worke, often repeating that sweet word, Blessed are the peace- 
makers, she had so much interest in the affections of good 
people, and did so palpably evidence that she minded not selfe 
that there was few but they would haue been prevailed upon by 
her, besides, she used to fal so home upon them with plain, 
down-right homely Rhetorick and scripture-grounds that few 
(I beleeue) had power to deny her request, she was so much 
for peace that she rolled every stone to compasse it, and if it 
was any thing that concerned her selfe, she would abate of her 
right in the pursuit, and loose much for purchase therof : yea, 
in a matter of apparent injury to the whole family in things 
ecclesiastical she was so intense upon accommadation as that she 
inclined rather to acknowledgement of some fault for peace-sake, 
then a sticking upon points for vindication of undoubted inno- 
cency : 

She was tenderly affected to the fruit of her wombe, the loue 
she bore to our bodys, tho natural, was spirituallized, But the 
loue she bore to our soules (wch is the soule of loue) was highly 
elevated ; I may say she travelled in birth again for us til 
christ was formed in us, and the latter travel was mostly sharper, 
oh wth what passionate teares and intreatys did she plead for 
us at the throne of grace ? what heart-awakening instructions 
hath she instantly inculcated upon us ! what heart-breaking 
passages of endeared affections hath she expressed to our soules ! 
she used to presse upon our consciences the undenyable maximes 
of Christianity, as about our fall in Adam, the corruption of our 
nature, subjection to the curse, redemption by cht, necessity of 
regeneration, the immortality and worth of the soule — the 
weight and concernments of eternity — and such like important 
truths wch might at once informe our judgmts rouze up aflfec-

tions, awaken conscience and through gods blessing prevaile 
upon the will, and I may say, I owe much to her as the instru- 
ment under god of that saving good wch at first I received, and 
I hope I shal never forget the instructions of a mother, I used 
to ride before her to excercises, and on the lords days to Denton 
Elinborough, Walmesly, and other places to hear sermons, and 
therby had much of her helpe, and was in some measure helpful 
to her memory by the notes of sermons I tooke : oh what divine 
lessons dropt from her precious lips, she was never weary of 
speaking of the things of god, it was her meat and her drinke 
to be doing and receiving good, her spirit was revived when 
she heard or mentioned any thing that concerned the glory of 
god or the good of soules : 

She tooke great care of us, that al her children might learn 
and say chatichisme, she highly esteemed and commended that 
of Mr Bals, she was continually putting us upon reading the 
scriptures and good bookes, and instructed us how to pray, and 
it was her constant custome when my father was gone to London 
to make al her children pray, tho some of us were but young 
yet we begun at the yongest, and left at th eldest, saying what 
we could before the lord, togather, and so we spent one evening 
at least in his absence, wch ceartainly was not in vain if it was 
onely to incourage and inbolden us for the future : 

though she was very indulgent to us, yet was she severe and 
sharp agt sin, especially such sins as she saw us inclined to, 
oh how did she disgrace sinful ways ! and endeavour to prevent 
our falling therunto, or a being habituated in any bad custome, 
she would never suffer us in the use of any idle words, no not 
some which others (even good people) thought there was no hurt 
in, her conscience was very tender, and durst not indulge her 
selfe or us in any thing that she suspected to be a sin : such 

of us as were trained up at schoole she did incourage to learne 
apace with such expressions as these, learning is an honour to 
the most honourable persons, the greatest noblemen, and gentle- 
mens sons goe to schoole, it fits for any condition and prepares 
persons for preferment, but especially for doing god service in 
his church, and therfore she would often urge us to learn, but 
principally to get grace, and tho she prized other things in their 
kind, yet she would often haue said that if god would but giue 
us grace she cared not so much wt we had besides : 

She loved true religion and the power of godlines where ever 

D 2

she saw it, and accounted sincere Christians the most excellent 
in the earth, and her dearest friends, and choycest companions, 
yea though never so poore, and when she had met with a Chris- 
tian friend, it was not easy to part them : she laid deeply to 
heart the death of any faithful minister and gracious Christian, 
fearing that was a presage of some approaching evil : it troubled 
her much to hear of the miscariages of the children of godly 
parents, and set her aworke to pray earnestly for them, account- 
ing that it may be some body may pray for my wandering 
children when I am dead and gone : 

She often complained of the want of true loue and decay of 
religion, and the abounding of sin in the world, it made her 
heart bleed to see how few minded their soules in good earnest, 
and when she saw security and sensuality, she would often haue 
sighed out such words as these, oh, how wicked are people ! 
how worldly ! how careles ! yea how beastly ! as tho they did 
not beleeue that tlier is any god or devil, or heaven or hel, I 
wonder what men think of, and whither they think they must 
goe when they die : Alas, what a griefe is it to see poore soules 

running as fast as they can towards hell ! — thus she condoled 
poore perishing sinners, and would haue examined and instructed 
poore senseles soules, she did sharpely reproue such as she 
heard sweare, and there was such an awe upon them by her 
presence that wicked persons durst not be vain and prophane 
before her, yea several that had little in them for religion, yet 
would haue forced themselues to some honest talke whiles in 
her company, and she would haue been repeating peeces of 
sermons to them : 

She was always in hand with the works either of her general 
or particular calling, and could never endure idlenes, yea her 
heart was mounting heavenwards as her hands were busy in 
her work, making some spiritual use of al passages in her way, 
I haue heard her often say she was never right exept she could 
get some good thing into her mind, whether she was lying in 
bed or walking by the way or any imployment, she tooke much 
pleasure in that scripture, joh 4 34, my meat is to doe the will 
of my hither, and she would often haue said we must be like 
Christ or mary, the first was always doing good, the latter 
always receiving good, she earnestly prest after these patternes, 
not contenting her selfe with low measures of grace or an easy 
round of duty. But doing what she did (especially in the 



Heywood Family. 53 

things of god) with al her might, it was a wonder to conceiue 
how it was possible that her frail tabernacle could bear such a 
weight of dutys and difficulty's, that was propt up with such 
few pillars of food or phisick or other supplys, not because she 
could not obtain them, but would not use them ; her frequent 
fastings, constant watchings, and dayly teares did so much 
exhaust her spirits, that it was strange these excessiue pains 
had not made an end of her long before : for she spared not 
her body in any service to her god, but thought 
that offering that up in holy dutys was but a [Rom 12 1 
reasonable service of god : this blessed consump- 
tion of her natural strength for spiritual ends was her desire al 
her life, and her comfort at Death : 

She was much endeared to the word of god, and tooke great 
pleasure in reading the scriptures, which she embraced as her 
portion and as her treasure, inheritance, necessary food, better 
then thousands of gold and silver, sweeter then the honey- 
combe — and other expressions wch she often repeated out of 
the 19 and 119 Psalme ; wch scriptures and several others she 
set her children a reading and would haue paused upon, as we 
read, but it was her great griefe that towards the latter end of 
her days, her eyes were grown dim, that she was very unable 
to read, and her memory was very shallow, yet it was far more 
tenacious of sermons, truths and divine things, then temporal 
matters, so that she hath related to us many passages of sermons 
she heard preacht before she was marryed, when as perhaps she 
had forgot other things spoken or done the day before : 

She had a very low account of the world and the glory of the 
world, profits, pleasures, honours, and was much taken with a 
sermon preacht upon that text in j joh 2 17 And the world 
passeth away, and the lust therof, but he that doth the wil of 
god abide th for ever : She would be often repeating instances 

of the vanity and instability of the world, and inferre good 
conclusions from thence, to distrust it to be weaned from it, 
and lay up better treasures even in heaven, which moth cannot 
corrupt, nor can theeues breake through to steal them : Her 

usual expressions were, oh what is this world good to ? how 
little wil these things stand in stead at death ? wt wil it profit 
a man to gain the whole world and loose his own soule ? alas 
what matter is it, what becomes of al the world so as we may 
haue an interest in Christ : 



54 



Heywood Family . 

She was weary of imployments and injoyments here below, 
and often sd she did the workes of her particular occasions 
rather from the sense of her duty, then from any delight therin, 
and that she cared not how little she had to doe in the world, 
and would put off the cares and affaires therof with as little as 
possibly she could that her spirit might be free for better excer- 
cises : And tho she wanted not any comfortable accommada- 
tions to render her life delectable, yet she was weary of living, 
and would fain be in heaven, perfectly to be freed from sin, 
and in joy the lord, too or three yeares before she dyed she 
was so set upon a desire of dissolution, and being with christ. 
that she had much adoe to silence the workings of her spirit, 
and argue her heart to a free submission to the lords pleasure 
herin, and that she might stay his leisure : She would often 
haue said to me (when going over to see her) Son I intreat you 
pray that I may be content to liue, I am troubled at my selfe, 
that I am no more willing to be at the lords dispose, whether 
in life or in death, yet her sweet and seasonable fore-tasts of 
heaven did stay her stomach til she might get a ful posessioi &gt; 
of that pleasant land, the land of promise : 

Her desires of a change by death did not proceed from sul- 
lenes, or discontent in her outward state but from spiritual 
principles, &amp; for holy ends, for none could be more thankful for 
the common mercys of this life then she was. Oh, how often 
hath she stood amazed and admiring gods gracious dealings 
with her and hers ! and often made use of Davids 
2 sam 7 18] words, who am I o lord god and what is mine 
house ! that thou hast brought us hitherto : h 
affected her heart much when the lord had preserved the 
family in health any considerable time, or recovered any of us 
out of distempers : She took notice of the least kindnes or 

courtesy from others, and owned the lord therin, often using 
that expression, o who are we that god should make us the head, 
and not the taile, that god should make us find favour in this 
sight of men, yt any body is willing to own and entertaine us 1 
why are not my children like-such, or such ? cloathed in rags, 
despised of al, accepted of none, — surely its gods free grace, 
not our deserts. Why haue we good houses to dwel in, warmij 
cloaths to cover and keep us warme ? why are not we put to 
beg our bread or worke for our living ? nay the lord provides 
horses to cary us swiftly and easily in our journeys, when others 



55 



Heywood Family. 

trudge afoot. She would reckon up many mercys, and stil say 
she could not be thankful enough for them, especially such 
mercys as concerned the soule and accompanyed salvation did 
fil her heart with ravishing joy and her tongue with praises. 

It was a sweet providence to me and it was much observed 
by her that the lord should giue into my bosome the gracious 
daughter of such a famous minister ; not onely for his sake, 
whom she dearly loved as a choyce instrument of good to her 
soule, and that poured out many prayers for his children, but 
also for my dear wiues sake whose piety and excellent qualitys 
shined forth in her even from her infancy, she hath often told 
me that she had promised, and would (through grace) performe 
it, to praise god every day upon her knees while she lived for 
that mercy, for wch indeed I may say experimentally she had 
cause, but I much more ; she much rejoyced to see my seed, 
and prayed earnestly for these too sons whom the lord had 
graciously given me, John and Eliezer, the latter wherof entred 
into the world just when she left it, being borne just three 
dayes before she dyed the lord giving an hopeful evidence of 
his design to fill up her Roome in the church militant by pre- 
paring another to stand in that gap : 

At last, this choyce peece of gods toofold workmanship of 
nature and grace, was to be taken down, her tottering tabernacle 
was to be levelled with the ground, and her precious soule to 
be loosed that it might take its flight into eternal mansions : 
and she that had been dying dayly found it no strange thing 
now to surrender her soule into the hands of him who gaue it, 
and had given himselfe to redeeme it, and had now a long time 
had quiet posession of it, the sting of death was pluckt out, and 
this debt to nature became a sweet refreshing sleep, yea as 
Solomon saith of the labouring man, that his sleep is sweet, so 
the weary steps through this tedious wildernes made Canaan 
more delightful, nay further, the exhausting her spirits by 
fasting and prayer did render her dissolution more easy since 
it was not a violent extrusion but a composed deposition of her 
soule : 

And though she had been under weaknes a considerable time, 
yet her body was a little reared up and strength recruited 
beyond expectation, tho stil she was very weake, yet hearing of 
a distemper that lay upon me she was desirous to come and see 
me, Before she came (as she told a neighbour of ours) she 



56 



Heywood Family . 

dreamed that she must goe into Yorkshire and dye there, and 
indeed the lord seemed to say to her as once 
[Num 20 25 2 6 to Aaron that he must goe up to mount Hor 
&amp; Moses and be gathered unto his people, and dye 
Deut 32 50] there : She complained that she was not wel 

as soon as she came hither, and had violent 
pain in her head, tho towards the latter end she was much 
addicted to sleeping, having a lightnes and dizzines in her head. 
About too days before she dyed we were at dinner, and tho she 
could eat nothing with us yet she came and sate her down by 
us and began savourily to discourse of the things of god, wch 
was as meat and drink to her, and that wch might feed our 
soules, and gaue us a distinct relation of her conversion and 
conversation, and several observable passages of her life, wch 
she spoke with expressions of admiration of gods free grace, 
and what a good god she had found the lord had been to her al 
her dayes, and did not question but we should find him to be 
the same to us, if we walkt in his wayes : 

On thuesday, wch was the day before she dyed, she rode to 
the chappel and heard my father Angier preach at the baptizing 
of my son Eliezer ; his text was, 2 pet 1 15 Moreover, I wil 
endeavour that you may be able after my decease to haue these 
things always in remembrance ; his excellent sermon seemed to 
be (as it were) her funeral sermon, being a clear description of 
her life, since it was her great care not onely to be helpful to 
the church of god while she was living, but to leaue behind her 
something that might advantage it when she was dead and 
gone, by her laying hold of the covenant for herselfe and her 
children, furthering gods publick worship, holy education of 
children, dedicating them to the lord, and pouring out many 
prayers both for them, and for the church, by her exemplary 
beating out a tract for posterity to walk in, and helping others 
memory s, and transmitting the word and workes of god to 
future generations, by frequent discourses, suitable application, 
and repetitions near her end, wch were al applicable to her, as 
they that knew her can abundantly testify : this sermon and 
her life had the same aspect, and were coincident, from wch she 
tooke her flight into glory : 

That night she slept little, the morning after she got up and 
would needs be going home towards Lane: before well time she 
would not be persuaded to returne home, but then put on her

riding cloaths, and prepared for a journey, but we saw she was 
in no fit posture for travelling but perceived her going apace to 
her long home, her flegme suddenly stopped, her strength 
failed, her colour changed, and she was (as we thought) near 
expiring, and therfore called my father Angier hastily to her, 
who prayed, with her, he askt her if she understood, she 
answered yes, very well, he told her he must leaue her, I am 
more sorry, sd she, he replyed, I haue committed you into the 
hands of your father, and necessary occasions cal me away, 
having stayed here beyond my intentions, thus they parted with 
sweet expressions of mutual affection, and patient submission 
to gods wil, and confident expectation of meeting in glory : 

She continued (as it were) slumbering without any great 
pain that we could perceiue, and being caryed up into the 
chamber, lay quietly upon the bed about an houre or too, and 
at last gaue up the ghost, and breathed out her precious soul 
into the hands of god, and tooke posession of that glory wch 
christ went to prepare for her : 

She dyed at my house in North-ourum 
about one a clock in the afternoone 
April 22 1657 : and was interred in 
Halifax church April 24 in the south- 
side of it, and in the same graue wherin 
Mr Boys a famous minister and some- 
times lecturer at Halifax was long since 
buryed : on either side wherof were laid 
too precious men that had been ministers of Coley : Mr Hierst, 
and Mr Clayton —

collected by her surviving husband 
for the future use of our two hopeful 
sons : — 

She was the excellent daughter of an eminent minister, useful 
in his place, and famous through the churches, Mr John Angier, 
who is yet living, and long may he liue to be a pillar in the 
house of god, a witnes to the truth, an example to his flock, 
and companion to his brethren in the ministery : She was 

born at Denton in Lancashire (the place where her precious

father hath been minister many years) if I 
mistake not about the 24th day of June 
1634: and was baptized by Mr Henry 
Root then preacher at Gorton, a neighbour 
chappel : she being nursed and nourished 
at home partakt of her natural parents 
excellent dispositions: She was naturally 

very witty and apprehensiue, especially 
in learning any thing : so that she could 
read the hardest chapter in the bible when 
she was but foure years of age, Mr Abiel 
Rathband was then school-master at Denton and taught her to 
write, in learning wherof she was more then ordinarily capable, 
being able at sixe years of age to write down passages of the 
sermon in the chappel : wch she by continual use of in processe 
of time did gradually grow to a great perfection in, so that she 
could haue repeated a sermon very methodically, distinctly, and 
succinctly : she writ long hand and not characters, yet she 
tooke the heads and proofes fully, and a considerable part of 
the inlargement, yea and observed and rendred the ministers 
drift and designe, so that I haue heard some say, they never 
heard their sermons so exactly repeated : wch evidenced not 
onely her natural ingenuity, but that by reason 
of use her senses were excercised in the things of 
god : and that she understood wt she spoke : 

For her acquaintance with scripture I may say 
of her as it was said of Timothy, that from a 
child she had known the holy scriptures, as she was constantly 
trained up in reading and rehearsing part therof morning and 
evening, so she committed to memory the whole booke of pro- 
verbs, the 8th of Romans, and several other portions of sacred 
writ : yea she tooke delight in reading the word, never a day 
past over her head wherin she read not divers chapters, morning 
and evening was she getting a repast in this pleasant garden, 
besides other oppertunitys of consulting these divine oracles, 
nor did she read the word immethodically, but she began at the 
beginning of the bible and tooke the scope of scriptures along 
with her : wherby she became wel versed in the sacred history, 
having read this blessed book so often over, nor did she doe it 
as a taske and regardlesly, but she meditated with delight in 
the word, and if she light upon a difficult passage she would

either ask me what I thought of it, (wch occasioned my further 
search into the scriptures) or haue recourse to the assemblys 
annotations or some other English exposition for the meaning 
therof, she made a trade of digging these holy mines, and re- 
tailing this precious coyn in heavenly discourse : her bodily 
stomach was very weak : and I haue wondered how she could 
liue with so little, but I see she had meat to eat that we knew 
not of, hidden manna, this honey-combe, and as a good woman 
once said, she made many a good meales meat of the promise 
in the want of food : 

She was about 8 years of age when her owne dear and 
precious mother dyed, wch tho it was a great losse to her, yet 
the lord was pleased in a short time in great measure to make 
it up, god providing a very tender mother, that was very affec- 
tionate to her, and she also was very obedient to 
her, Their hearts were knit in the closest bonds [Sanctior est 
of spirituall affection, and this Christian knot of copula cordis 
mutual endearednes was sweeter and stronger qm corporis: 
then natural relation : 

I haue often admired her selfe-denyal in praying that her 
mother might haue children, in pleading on her behalfe, and 
speaking so wel of her, tis true her mother had ingaged her by 
many tokens of loue, and her sweet cariage to her whiles under 
her tuition, yet ther was a high degree of grace, superadded to 
a sweet disposition wch was the chiefe attractiue in both ther 
affections, and made their soules center in the main matters of 
Christianity, no loue was lost betwixt them since like Naomi 
and Ruth they claue togather inseparably, and are become 
examples to others in that relation of meeknes, endearednes and 
voluntary condescention : 

She begun whiles she was yet yong to seek the lord god of 
her fathers, and by degrees, received sweet and liuely influences 
and impressions of grace, and I know not whether I may say 
she was sanctifyed from the womb, or had the seeds of holines 
instilled into her heart with her mothers milke, tho it was an 
occasion of sad disputes and questionings about her state, 
because she did not remember any such signal juncture of time 
wherupon she could reckon for her clear transition from nature 
to grace ; she was often in feares about the main work for want 
of those strong convictions and deep humiliations that others 
had, and would frequently mention the grounds of fear wch 



60

those haue who were trained up under godly parents, lest the 
power of a religious education should be the root and chiefe 
branch of their religion ; for my own part tho I think such 
may haue some grounds of selfe-suspicion wch may promote 
selfe-examination, yet as god hath his various times and ways 
of working so those that haue been piously educated, and haue 
made no apparent defection into grosse sin, and haue kept on 
a course of secret dutys from principles of couscience, and are 
afraid of offending god in any thing may hopefully beleeue the 
work is wrought tho they haue not felt those shakings and 
convulsions in their soules that others haue met with : tho in 
such possibly this work may be more obscure to them al their 
days : 

But this 1 haue observed, that god comes by some shaking 
affliction, or conviction to unbottome such a soul from its own 
righteousnes, or leaues it to fal into some reproachful sin, 
wherby he takes occasion to awaken conscience, or leads it 
into some notable ways of selfe-discovery, and then begets or 
acts some liuely springings of the spirit of grace in the heart : 
this I may confidently and groundedly say on the behalfe of 
this precious saint, that tho it is unceartain when the work of 
conversion was wrought, yet tis ceartain a saving work there 
was, wch did sensibly manifest it selfe many ways and at many 
times, as al that knew her can bear witnes and her own con- 
science sometimes testifyed : 

She very much excercised in the duty of secret prayer,, after 
she had read her chapters she always went to prayer and would 
shut her selfe in a room and be long alone, tho satan often took 
advantage from her timerous nature to affright her in the dark 
night to hinder her in the performance by groundles feares, 
putting her on sometimes to cut short dutys, or to be diverted 
therin, yea the temptation did sometimes prevail for her total 
omission at that time, wch occasioned many sad thoughts of 
heart, and hard cases of conscience w r ch she often propounded 
to me, and I gaue her the best advice and incouragement I 
could in those cases : it was the sad complaint of her soul that 
she found not the lord in secret, but her heart was much shut 
up, that she could not pour out her .soul (like Hanna) before 
the lord, and that wheras in secret dutys the heart is to be 
onely imployed, she found her heart often least imployed ; she 
often lamented the ficklenes and vanity of her heart when she 



Heywood Family. &lt;51 

set her selfe purposely to the duty of meditation, what abun- 
dance of vain thoughts thronged in to hinder that sweet excer- 
cise : she was diligent in taking a view of her own heart and 
state by selfe-examination, and tho it often found her matter of 
humiliation, yet she took the more delight in that work which 
helped on the great work of repentance, and was introductory 
to so much spiritual peace and comfort : 

From her very infancy she was of so sweet and tender a dis- 
position yt she always delighted in loue and concord, and could 
never indure anger or contention ; in any matters of contest or 
controversy that lei out upon any occasion she would often say, 
let us yeeld rather then contend ; she had a notable dexterity 
in putting off or interpreting to the best what might tend to 
animosity : Aboue al that ever I knew she was the most careful 
to promote Christian unity and prevent evil surmisings, wch she 
did most effectually by faithful and plain-dealing, what she had 
heard groundedly she used to tel the partys concerned and not 
to divulge it behind their backs to others, wch was an healing 
way, and did usually heal to the bottome : she was of an open, 
plain, upright heart, and hated dissembling, and perfidiousnes, 
and could quickly spy and smell out flatterers, and did not desire 
intimacy with them, she was much delighted with that of Solo- 
mon faithful are the wounds of a friend but the kisses of an 
enemy are deceitfull : she was excedingly indeared to those yt 
were most faithful to her, and tel her most plainly of what 
they saw amisse in her : and there lyes much grace in giving 
or taking reproofe aright and with a suitable spirit : 

She was the mirrour of patience and subjection in her rela- 
tion, as a child as a wife, and of tendernes and care as a sister, 
and as a mother : many can bear witnes that while she lived 
in her fathers house she was an unparaleld child, she observed 
her fathers eye and mind and chearfully accommadated her 
selfe to his command : when she had the greatest desire of any 
thing, if she observed her fathers inclination contrary, it fully 
satisfyed her : she did what she thought would please him, and 
forbore that wch she suspected would displease him, she com- 
plyed with his wil to giue him content, not so much from slavish 
fear as from a child-like affection ; her heart was exceedingly 
knit to her good father with more then ordinary endearednes, 
so that she could not indure any reproach cast upon him, (as 
indeed there was no just cause) and wn there was any such 



62 



Reywood Family. 

thing wch reflected on him spoken, she seriously said, it went 
nearer her heart then if it had been agt herselfe : tis true there 
was great cause to loue such a father, but we know, loue de- 
scends seldome ascends with so strong a channel as hers was, 
and her goodnes in that relation was a clear prognostick of her 
goodnes in another : 

She was as loving a wife as ever lay in any mans bosome, if 
she offended any way it was through vehemency of affection, 
the lord brought us togather and continued our relation in 
abundance of mercy, for wch I haue cause to blesse him whiles 
I liue ; the circumstances about our closure are observable ; 
her inclination towards me at the first view, a years interrup- 
tion, or prevention of a motion, my disappointments otherways, 
her opposition to more probable motions, her constancy to me, 
my gradual complacency in her, every time more then other ; — 
the review of these passages and many other is both pleasant 
and satisfying that the hand of the lord was in it, and the 
effects haue answered the promises, for never had couple so 
much comfort in each other and so little discontent, as we had 
in that sixe years we were togather, we were contracted in the 
close of a solemne day of prayer in my fathers study by Mr 
Nat: Rathband, about a moneth before our mariage and then 
solemnly conjoyned in that sweet relation in Denton Chappel 
April 24 1655, it was a very great solemnity, a multitude of 
people being present, Mr Harrison of Ashton preacht the mar- 
riage sermon upon Eph 5 31 and they too shal be one flesh : 
this was verified, and the lord helpt us also to be one soul and 
spirit, drawing togather in the same yoke, being heires togather 
of the same grace of life, onely she ripened faster, and is pluckt 
sooner then this vile worme thats left behind to condole so 
heavy a losse : 

She had a very tender affection to her poore brother and 
sister, and wept many tears for them, especially for her brother 
whose extravagancys broke her heart as if she had been his 
mother, she loved him so dearly whiles they were both yong, 
that she could haue wisht to haue born his corrections for him, 
and many times did she use her utmost endeavours to doe him 
good, her heart was much caryed after his souls good, and she 
trembled to inquire of him, lest she should hear what was evil. 
0 what fears and jealousys had she for him ? what tears and 
prayers did she powre out for him? what letters of graue 



63 



Beymod Family. 



advice did she write unto him ? how did it rejoyce her hart to 
read his penitential letteis out of NE? and how did she re- 
joyce in the hopes of his wel- doing ? 

Many said, and we feared, that she would never be able to 
bear children, because of the little-nes and weaknes of her 
body, but she prayed to the lord as Hanna, and he opened her 
womb and the next year, Apr. 18 1656, she brought forth her 
firstborn son, who is called John after her Reverend father, I 
pray god he may tread in his steps : the ensuing year upon 
April 18 1657 she was delivered of another son, 
and named him Eliezer, because she said the god [Exod 18 4 
of my fathers hath been my help, and he might 
truely be called so, for she found miraculous help from god at 
both times, for tho in nature it seemed improbable, if not im- 
possible that she should bring forth, yet she was brought through 
her pangs shortly, with as much ease and little danger as others 
ordinarily in that condition, such indeed tho never so strong 
are put to all they haue, but tho she had little strength of her 
own, yet the lord came in with a fresh supply of almighty 
power, and that was sufficient for her ; and truely I rather take 
these children as a fruit of the promise and returns of prayer 
as Isaac, then issuing from the strength of nature, as Ishmael : 
and o that they may in all things answer that pattern ; they are 
very perfect in the composition of nature, oh that they may be 
as compleat in the restauration of gods image by grace : they 
haue good ingenuity, and excellent endowments according to 
their years and capacity, oh that another and an excellent 
spirit may fal upon them, such as rested on their dear deceased 
mother : Oh the strong crys and ardent prayers she powred 

out for them ! her working bowels towards them 1 her travelling 
again till cht be formed in them ? her careful instructing of 
them ? tho she was more then ordinarily endeared to them yet 
she sometimes promoted their seasonable correction, especially 
for playing at prayers, wherby they are brought into an exact 
complvance in the outward man : and that scripture 
holds forth both our duty and incouragement, train [Pro 22 6 
up a child in the way he should goe, and when he 
is old he wil not depart from it : 

The lord was pleased to train up the subject of this discourse 
under the severe discipline of the rod, from her youth up she 
suffered the frequent visits and vicissitudes of some painful

distemper, phisitians said when she was in greatest health, she 
was of the weakest constitution that they had observed in any, 
her constant tormenting infirmity whiles she was a maid was 
the splen, wch forced her to several postures for ease, and very 
loathsome potions for recovery, the day before our mariage she 
could scarce abide out of bed, that morning of the nuptials she 
was so ful of pain that she feared she should scarce be able to 
come out of the chamber, yet the lord gaue a seasonable re- 
viving, but within a week or fourtnight after she was surprized 
with a violent feaver, yet the lord had mercy on her, and not 
on her onely but on me also lest I should haue a sudden abate- 
ment of my comfort. Yea after mariage she injoyed more 
health abundantly then before, excepting those necessary 
troubles of nature in breeding and bearing children : so that 
I had much joy in her while I injoyed her, and she had much 
benefit by al her afflictions, the lord made the house of correc- 
tion to be her schoole of instruction, she often blest god that 
he would take the pains to whip her rather then suffer her to 
wander : her cloudy, dropping day of affliction made her fruit- 
ful, and the blessed sun-shine did ripen her for glory, the lord 
did teach her dependance, obedience, and thankfulnes by what 
she suffered, and those short sufferings were not to be compared 
with that glory wch is to her revealed, and of wch she is now 
posessed : 

She was exceeding prudent and provident in managing the 
affaires of the family, wch were wholly committed to her over- 
sight and charge ; and whatsoever she took in hand prospered, 
I found by experience that the lord blessed us for her sake, 
bringing us very handsomely through the world hitherto with 
a smal maintenance, so that our visible layings out haue seemed 
more then our comings in, yet we got not into debt, but dis- 
charged some, provided household goods by degrees, and found 
the secret of the lord upon our tabernacle, wch hath made us 
truely rich to contentment, she was abundantly satisfyed with 
her condition in the world, and did not aspire higher, yea when 
I had motions of prefermt, she exprest abundance of selfe- 
denyall in willingnes to continue where god had settled-us, and 
often said she would never be content that I should leaue Coley 
for more means, she had abundant complacency in the people 
here, and found that we wanted nothing but were fed with food 
convenient for us, She took no delight in the great things of

the world, nor any mirth or feasting, nor yet in the company of 
great gallants, but would rather haue been familiarly discoursing, 
or praying wth a poore saint, then complementing with others : 

It pleased the lord to excercise her with four several abortions 
or miscariages of the womb, as before she had born three living 
and liuely sons, and all this in sixe years, which untimely 
births (as phisitians told us) exceedingly weakened her strength 
and wasted her spirits, and was an occasion of her death, 
means were used, yet were not blessed for health, she finding 
weaknes increasing the winter before she dyed she took much 
time to set house and heart in order for her great change, and 
did every thing as one that was ready to take her flight into 
eternity : she would haue no cloaths bought, except for present 
use, because she said, she was shortly to take her leaue of all, 
she provided linnen for us that we might haue nothing to buy 
of one year at least : She sometimes spoke of my second 

mariage desiring me to keep gods way as I did before, and god 
would provide wel for me again : she mentioned not onely 
some characters but persons to me, that she apprehended might 
be suitable to me and helpful to my children, many choyce 
peeces of serious councel did she giue me wch I hope I shal 
Remember whiles I liue : 

too things she did particularly urge upon me, 1 that I would 
be much in secret prayer, and look chiefly to the frame of my 
heart therm, 2 never to pray without mentioning the church, 
of god, if it be but too or three words, said she, yet let Jerusa- 
lem come into your mind, and I confesse I haue found more 
evidence and advantage by frequency in these then ever before : 
and as formerly she had spent much time in secret prayer, so 
now towards her latter end she -was abundantly imployed in 
those Christian excercises alone, yea she was an instrument of 
much good to me, for when we were threatened for keeping 
private days with our friends, it was her motion that we two 
as we could get oppertunity should spend some time by our 
selues in fasting and prayer, we designed a day in every week 
for that work tho we were often prevented by company or 
occasions. But oh what a mighty spirit of prayer had she ! 
what tears did she powr out ? what expostulations did she use 
with the lord ? what sweet and suitable promises did she vigor- 
ously plead ? how much of her time in those dutys did she 
take up in pleading for the church ? truth it is she had not 

E 



66 Heyivood Family . 

onely the powerful spirit of prayer, but an admirable gift in 
prayer, wherbv she was able extempore to expresse her selfe to 
god in scripture phrases, and such suitable words as were no 
doubt both acceptable to god, and would haue been discharged 
from incongruitys by the severest censurers of extemporary 
devotions ; I shal never forget some of her expressions, I haue 
seldome heard any private Christian, so exact and able in 
prayer, my heart hath been usually more affected when joyning 
with her then praying my selfe, yet what she did herin was 
with abundance of modesty becoming and adorning her sexe, 
and age : 

upon thursday April 18 we tooke our journey for Lancashire 
with our little sons being sent for by our dear father to Denton, 
to see if by change of aire and use of means the frail consti- 
tution of her body might be recovered. She rid wel upon her 
fathers easy-going horse : we got through in too days, as we 
went along she often bade fare wel to Yorkshire, and was per- 
swaded she should never returne that ways agen, as indeed it 
proved, tho I hoped otherwise, it was an observable providence 
that god should so order this exchange, sending my dear mother 
to dye with me in my house and sending my endeared wife to 
dye in her fathers house, where she drew her first breath, when 
she first came thither we had some hopes that she recovered, 
She went to Manchester to consult phisitians and whether by 
motion, or some other cause she was in great danger of death, 
and seemed to be breathing her last a great part of that night, 
yet it pleased the lord to restore her for a season, and to bring 
her back to Denton, and therin to answer her request that if 
it were his will she might not take her end there, &amp; at that 
time. After that she did apparently weaken, she tooke little 
phisick, for the doctors durst not administer any to her, they 
said it was a consumption of the lungs and that the liver was 
sound : Upon the friday before she dyed about 5 a clock in 

the afternoon when she had been in a sore fit panting and 
struggling for breath, seeing the children about her (not her 
owne, but those of the family) she said, Sirs prepare for this 
time, for it wil come to you that are yong, as wel as to me, I 
want breath to speak, oh spend your breath wel, not in idle 
vain talke, but to gods glory. Remember you must giue 
account of every idle word, cary your selues rcspectiuely 
towards your governours, it is a line thing to sec inferiours 



67 



ffeywood Family . 

Cary themseluea fespectiuely towards their superiours, to goe 
when they bid them, and come when they bid them, to doe 
what they would haue them, tho it crosse their own wils. 

Being in another sore fit, her breath stopping, her father 
went to prayer with her, after prayer being revived she said, I 
blesse god I am better, blessed be god for his covenant, he hath 
made with me an everlasting covenant, ordered in al things 
and sure, this is al my salvation and all my desire : Being 

asked if she did not find god gracious to her, she answered, 
yes : in supporting and reviving me, but I doe not find the 
lord speaking so clearly to my soule, that he is mine and I am 
his as I desire : but I wil cleaue to him til he please to come 
in to my soule, it is fit we should wait his time, Oh come, 
come lord, lift up the light of thy countenance, one glimpse of 
thy face is worth ten thousand worlds, if there were so many, 
And turning her speech again to the children, she said, Srs 
take heed of pride, this pride in apparel, it will stink at such a 
time as this, take heed of pride, it wil bring you low, pride 
goes before destruction, and an haughty spirit before a fall, 
labour for humility, it is a grace yt adornes all other graces, 
labour to fear god, serue him with a perfect heart, and a willing 
mind, blessed are they that walk in the law of the lord, blessed 
are they that fear god, it brings not onely a blessing to our 
selues but to our children, and sometimes to many generations. 
Labour to be right Christians, it is not to goe to church, and 
come away, and hear, and no more, but if you will be Christians 
indeed, you must hide the word in your heart, — meditate of it, 
and get the sweetnes out of it, there is secret dutys you must 
be careful of, meditation, selfe-examination, and searching the 
heart, labour to watch over that, and endeavour to get a stock 
of grace, spend time wel, it is a fine thing to spend time well : 

Then turning her speech to her father and husband she said, 
you that are elder keep close to god and his truths doe not for-

the greatest affliction before the least sin, if you should be put 
to the hardest tryal, if they should take away your hues, it wil 
but send you sooner to your reward, and that wil be no hurt 
to you, if god doe suffer these lordly-spirited-men to afflict his 
church for a time, I doe beleeue it wil not be long, the lord is 
dear of his church, and wil not suffer it always to be trampled 
upon, Oh sirs, let the church of god lye near your heart, it

lyes near gods heart, they shal prosper that loue it, prefer

yet thou didst deliver them ; and for thy

servants that are thrust out of their places, 
let them not want : Lord, pardon, pardon, pardon to this 

kingdome that great sin of covenant-breaking, and find out 
some way that the covenant may be revived in these nations, 
yet once again, yet once again : 

A short time after she had spoken these things I came to 
her, and mentioned what she had said, she replied, that she 
wondered at herselfe how she begun and proceeded in that 
discourse, and thought it strange that she had spoken such 
things, and so did others, since her modesty had formerly shut 
up her lips in silence : but her honoured father judged it some 
strange extac.y wherin she was acted by a strong motion of the 
spirit, beyond her purpose, and aboue her present infirmity : 

I Asked her further, if she had nothing to say with respect 
to her dear children, she told me indeed they were not in her 
thoughts at that time, but she had committed them to god, her 
loving father, and hoped I would take care of them, and did 
beleeue god would hear prayers for them : She had sent them 

home into Yorkshire the week before, and tho she was a most 
tender-hearted mother, yet she seemed as, it were, to forget 
them, at least to be weaned from them and to be taken up with 
greater matters : 

That night she powred out her soul to god in a serious and 
fervent prayer, for her own soul, that god would shine upon 
her, and giue her the sealings of his spirit, and oh, what heart- 
melting expressions did she use to that purpose ! then she pro- 
ceeded to pray for me, with reference to the place where god 



69

had set me, and the troubles I had met with, anl begged 
earnestly that god would continue me there, she prayel for 
her dear father and the ministers of the gospel, for their pre- 
servation and sucoesse in the lords worke : and then for the 
family wherin she was, that the lord would reward their labour 
of loue, and dwel in it, and for the church of god, that the 
jews might be converted and that the gospel might be preaehed 
to the remainder of gentile-nations, and for these nations, she 
prayed heartily for the king, and all in autority &amp;c. thus she 
proceeded in a methodical and distinct recommending of these 
things to god in fit and scripturall words very sweetly and 
seriously, when she had finished her prayer and perceived that 
we had heard her who were with her in the roome, she said I 
did not think any body should haue heard me ; 

She slept little that night, but would often be asking me 
good questions of spiritual concernment, and kept me waking 
to discourse of soul-affaires : and she had used that practice 
ofteu before, when she perceived me drowzy and rather inclined 
to sleep, she would lovingly tel me she was not to be long with 
me, and it would repent me when she was gone, that I had 
been no more helpful to her : the lord pardon the neglects he 
hath discovered in me herin : 

Upon the Saturday her father askt her how she felt her 
spirit, she answred that all her fears were removed, and her 
doubts satisfyed, nothing did much trouble her which was a 
choyce mercy, for a great part of her life she had sharp conflicts 
with the prince of darknes, and the unbeleefe of her own 
heart, oh the sad complaints wch I haue been witnes to ! she 
sometimes had temptations to Leaue the ordinance of the lords 
supper, when she was in the place, ready to receiue, yet staying 
and partaking she ordinarily found satisfaction, yet sometimes 
she had greater perplexity afterwards as having no right ther- 
unto, yet now at length her heart was quieted, and her spirit 
calmed, doubts silenced, and feares banished, tho she found 
not such sensible comforts, and ravishing joys as many attain 
unto ; yet I am apt to think she felt more then she did or 
could expresse, for just as her breath stopt she endeavoured to 
speak something, but could not utter it, but was taken up to 
her long-desired rest, to feel what no eye can see or tongue 
expresse :

and went to keep a perpetual sabboth with her dearest husband, 
and upon the thuesday ensuing she was decently interred by 
her own dear and precious mothers graue : Mr John Harrison 
of Ashton who preached our mariage-sermon, preached also her 
funeral sermon, upon that text she had felt the sweetnes of, 
and desired might be spoken to, in 1 cor 15 57 : But thanks 
be to god wch giveth us the victory through our lord jesus 
christ. Her death was exceedingly lamented by all, and as 
she was respected in her life, so she was much honoured at her 
death by the solemne attendance of very many of the gentry, 
ministry, and great multitudes of the ordinary sort at her 
funeral. 

The life of MTRIS ANGIER mother to my first dear wife, first 
wife to my dear and Reverend-father Mr John Angier taken 
out of his own book, and transcribed by me 0 H for the 
comfort of my two sons, this instant Jan 26 1G80-1 
Thus he writes 

The close of the days of Mtris Ellen Angier the tenderly 
loving and dearly beloved wife of Mr John Angier who slept 
her sweet sleep, finished her course and ended her afflictions 
on Wednesday morning Decemb 14 1642 between 3 and 4 of 
the clock in the morning, and was committed to her bed of 
rest Dec 1 5 betwixt 2 and 3 of the clock in the afternoon 
It is to be premised that god moved her heart to seek him 
from 8 yeares of age yet never gaue her settled assurance of 
his loue, and beside, — this pressing affliction (concerning wch 
she would often hane &amp;d if god would ‘that way shew his mercy 
all other afflictions would be easy) god excercised her with 
much weaknes of body, and unkindnes of friends, which did 
much afflict her, and some infirmitys common to man, wch she 
bore as an heavy burden, not attaining the power she earnestly 
and continually desired, and Satan taking advantage therefrom, 
especially from gods denyal of that measure of peace she so 
much and so long had prayed for, he the more weakened her 
assurance, suggesting continually to her, and pressing upon 
her, that her heart was never changed and indeed, god brought 
her through many deaths before her marriage, and after : 
Two yeares and more before her death, god excercised her with 
great weaknes of body, great distemper in her head, that she 
often feared the losse of her senses, continual! and extream

pain in her back, as if it had been broken, grievous and cutting 
straitnes in her breast, that she was unable to walk, unable 
sometimes to lye down in her bed, and so painfull chat she 
often said she could be content to haue her brest ripped open 
for a little ease, and complained that her grief was hid from 
the phisitians, as indeed it was, yet amidst these bodily in- 
firmitys and many weaknesses, god gaue her conception after 
almost 8 yeares respite, hauing often put it into my heart to 
pray for the inlarging of my family, yet after her conception 
her weaknes and wearines increased, and was not mitigated as 
usually after she quickened, so that she feared she should not 
come to her time, but miscarry, and often said it would be her 
death ; About 12 weeks before her full account, her extremity 
increased ; a full moneth, before her deliverance, god confined 
her to her chamber, when both days and nights were very 
wearisome, she being unable well to sit, to goe or to lye in her 
bed,: She was delivered Nov 21 1642 in the evening after 

hard labour, she told me after that the midwife gaue her dis- 
couraging words, and sd there was no hope, which did much 
trouble her, then did god on the sudden giue her deliverance 
a little before she sent for me and desired me to help her for 
her strength and patience were spent : Nov 27 1642 we brought 
the child to the sacrament of Baptisme, called her name Mary,: 
Before this Nov 19 at night she had the toothake in great ex- 
tremity, but god released her in a short time, the next day she 
was very sick, and in the night she vomited and in the morning 
began her labour, though in her own accouut she wanted 7 
weeks, I desired to look up to god for her, and god helped me 
unexpectedly with Exod 63 17 : he affected my heart before 
with psal 40 17 : lam poor and needy yet the Lord thinketh 
upon me, psal 102 13 the time to favour her, yea the set time 
is come : accordingly god graciously brought her through those 
straits ; betwixt 8 and 9 a clock the forementioned evening : 
the swelling wherewith she was troubled still continued, and 
increased, yet having seen so much of gods mighty power sup- 
porting her, so long a time, I hoped the Lord might spare her 
unto me — Dec 22 she often desired me to pray to god that he 
would not stay too long, though her nights were usually weari- 
som yet that night she had comfortable rest, but in the morning 
after it was very ill, when I came to her she told me she had 
abundance of rest, she knew not how to be thankfull enough,

but what it would turn to god only knows, she added oh that 
I might depart in peace, this stirre will not last always, but 
they shal be at rest and I also 
Q she asked me, where is my life ! 

Ans: in the hands of god, 

Kept: she suddenly replyed, it is hid with Christ in god, when 
he who is our life shall appear, we shall appear with him in 
glory : 

March 2 3 1641 god gaue her more clearnes and comfort 
then formerly for so long a time togather, as appeares more at 
large in my little book : 

But her disconsolatenes returned, she sometimes said, where 
is god ? shall I not see him ! how long will he tarry ? often 
complained of want of patience, often sd what shall I doe ? 
what will god doe with me ? what doe you think ? 

About noon Dec 22 she sd she would fain speak to the chil- 
dren, but could not, she was so straitned in her breast I asked 
her whether I should send for John, she sd no, but bid me doe 
wt I thought fitting (he being at school at Manchester) her 
mind was taken off the children, I often brought the little one 
to her to kisse it, but she did not much regard it, yet at this 
time god opened her mouth, she spake to her daughter, and 
bade her get god for her father and mother, for she knew not 
how soon father and mother might be gone, to labour to please 
her father &amp;c And then speaking of John, she said, that poor 
child, the Lord redeem his soule, and keep him out of base 
company, it may be my poor words may sometime sink with 
him, and my poor desires for him may come forth 

Then she spake to me desiring that I would take care to 
train them up in gods fear, that I would remember that they 
were my first born, and not suffer servants to rule over them, 
I asked her whether she did mis-doubt me, she answered, no 
indeed, though she had sometimes jested with me, she did not 
mistrust me at all : at that time she said theres pretty good 
store of linnen let the children haue part therof : 

At night she sd to her friends that were with her, labour to 
be prepared to goe through such difficultys, you may goe long 
on in profession, and meet with hard things when you think 
the worst is past, and this I would say to old and young, that 
they would be more plain one with another, in what they say 
amisse, for jf things be not amended god will remoue the means

when I am gone, and then the fault shal not be laid upon me, 
that I was a meanes to draw away my husband I can clear my 
heart and hands in that here and elsewhere, my husband is by 
let him speak to the contrary if he can, I answered, Loue, god 
hath shewed us this mercy that we haue followed him without 
any worldly respect 

She went on with her speech begun to her two friends, what 
any haue seen amisse in me, let them take no incouragement 
therby, and what I haue done in the uprightnes of my heart, 
though it hath not been well taken, I pray god lay it not to 
their charge : 

To me she said I am indeed in a strait whether to Hue or 
dye, I would fain liue still, and this is all that I remember she 
expressed in desire to liue : 

Tuesday night I went not to bed till after 12 of the clock 
being sollicitous for my wife, that god would further manifest 
himself unto her, before one of the clock they called me up, 
she being very ill, she then sd Lord receiue my spirit, into thy 
hand I commit my spirit, for thou hast redeemed it, come Lord 
Jesus, come quickly, make no tarrying he doth not yet come, 
will he not make hast? I answered, yes, in his own time, she 
replyed the time is come, my strength fades, my heart and my 
patience also she added, Loue, why will you not let me goe, I 
asked her, whither wouldst thou goe ! she answered, to my god, 
I answered I was willing to resign her up, to him from whom 
I had received her, she again sd, why should you be unwilling 
to let me goe ? I again answered though I am sorry to part 
with thee, yet I am willing to let thee goe to god, she yet again 
sd to us all, you know not what wrong you doe me that you 
will not let me goe to god, she asked me whether there was no 
hope, no signe that her time was near, and looked upon her 
own hands : I asked her how god did manifest himself to her? 
she sd he will be a god of free-grace to me. I suppose the day 
before she sd, I haue left my self with him, and if he will cast 
me away let him, my expectation is only from him,: she prayd 
that the Lord would come, and that Christ Jesus would intreat 
him to come, that she might goe to rest, and he did not long 
stay for then she desired to goe to another bed, where after a 
short but some pretty hard wrestlings with death she went 
away in a sweet sleep. 

God had taken her heart from minding the children or any

thing else, and god had weaned my heart, that thoughts and 
affections of marriage were almost utterly gone. Notwith- 
standing her long weaknes her death was somewhat sharp and 
she sensible to the last, though she had much feared the losse 
of them, she also feared lamenes. 

God shewed mee mercy in that he spared me on the sabboth 
day, according to my earnest desire. 

Dec 15 about two in the afternoon, I laid the body of my 
wife in her bed of rest, Isai 57 2. 3 gentlemen and Mr Hor- 

rocks her kinsman, a graue minister of their own accord took 
hold on the bier and brought her to the graue, this honour the 
Lord did her, and though friends had but short warning, yet 
it pleased god they came most of them, and Mr Horrocks 
preached his text and sermon on the Lords day well suiting, 
Rom 6 ult, the last part, the gift of god is eternall life through 
Jesus Christ our Lord : one of our gentlemen who was absent 
wrote a letter to me wch was some refreshing unto me : 

Dec 18 1642 god sent Mr Hollinworih to help me, who 
preached out of Job 34 29 if he giue quietnes who then 
can make trouble, — the Ld did graciously help him, he sd one 
good look from god would make things well with a kingdom 
or person Dec 29 my children were in the parloar praying 
togather (John was about 11, Elizab about 8 at that time) and 
hearing a noyse I went to the door, and heard my son at 
prayer, who with his sister acknowledged to god that they had 
despised father and mother, contrary to gods command, and 
therfore god had taken away their mother he desired god that 
they might not provoke him by their sinning to take away 
their father also, this did much affect me : 

The same night my daughter came to me and asked me what 
chapter it was that I read, for it was a fine one, I told her it 
was the 57 of Isaiah, I askt her what she observed in it, she 
said, that god would dwell with the humble and contrite heart, 
it was wel observed : 

Jan 10th when John was ready to goe to Manchester, I 
asked him him what they did when they went into the parlour 
togather he sd first one prayed, then another, I askt my 
daughter what they prayd for, she sd that god would make her 
sensible of the losse of their mother, and of their sins, and 
pardon them : I found god did more then formerly affect my 

heart in prayer for them :

Feb 24 4§ after prayer my daughter Elizabeth was taken ill, 
I asked her whether she was willing to dye she sd No, unlesse 
god would pardon her sins, I asked her whether she was not 
willing to goe to her mother ! she sd yes, if she knew she must 
goe to her. She sd she had gone to her prayers morning and 
evening since her mother dyed, I asked her whether she did so 
before her mothers death she said, yes sometimes, but con- 
stantly since, I asked her why she was more carefull since? 
she sd she knew not whether she must be the next, she sd, she 
desired god would prepare her if he did call for her. I asked 
her, why she was troubled at her mothers death ? she sd, 
because she did teach her to fear god, and because it was a 
grief to me, I asked her only to try her whether she loved me 
or her mother best ? she sd she loved all as one : psal 8 out 

of the mouths of babes and sucklings. 

A short account of the life of my dear and honoured father 

RICHARD HEY WOOD of little Leaver in Bolton parish 

in Lancashire : 

Oliver Heywood marryed Alice sister of Adam Hilton of 
Breakmit, a very Religious woman, who prayed affectionatly 
for her husband, being yet carnall, he was civil, and just 
betwixt man and man, only on Lords days in afternoon he used 
to meet others and they shot at Buts till evening on Lomax 
mosse, which was judged in those days an harmles Recreation : 
Mr Hubbert then minister at Cockey, frequently called as he 
walkt down to Little Leaver Hall, his wife desired Mr Hubbert 
to speak to her husband to be carefull of his soul, to pray in 
his family : he did so saying Oliver, you must mind your soul, 
pray with your family, he answered him, yes, yes Sir, there 
shall be no want of those things : but he still neglected, till 
Thomas Paget preaching at a Bury fair Oliver Heywood went 
to church, and whatever his design was, gods design was gra- 
cious, for it pleased the Lord to touch his heart by a saving 
conviction when he was aboue 60 yeares of age That same 
Mr Paget was persecuted went into Holland beyond sea, re- 
turned to Shrewsbery, Mr Warren of Pointon designing the 
parsonage of Stockport for a younger son then a young 
scholler, sent for Mr Paget a very old man to be parson there 
till his son was fit for the place : Mr Paget told me how gra- 

cious, zealous and industrious this good old man was after god 
wrought on his heart, and did constantly travel to Blakely

chappel (wch was 7 miles), every Lords day to hear him, then 
he needed not to be put on to pray in his family or closet, now 
he outstript his good wife in Religious dutys, the whole countrey 
rung of his extraordinary forwardnes in the wayes of god : he 
was of a sweet, louing, louely nature and grace inhanced it to 
an higher degree : he took great delight in, care of his daugh- 
ter-in law, my dear mother, did what he could for her : he was 
much with god in secret prayer and meditation : he shut him- 
self in his chamber many houres, and when she went to call 
him to meat, he would say, Ah Alice thou little knowest what 
hurt thou hast done me, for thou hast robbed me of my god, 
i e by interrupting his communion with god in duty : some- 
times he walked into the fields as Isaac to meditate : one time 
a friend found him going about a tree, as if he was seeking 
somthing, he asked him what he wanted, his answer was he 
had lost his god, and was seeking him : I am not ceartain how 
long he liued after he was converted but I think ten or twelue 
yeares 

Oliver Heywood had 4 children, John who dyed young : 
Richard (my father) Mary, who was never marryed, and I 
think was blind, and John of Chappel, (so called, because it 
was built of the wood of the chappel belonging to little Leaver 
hall) he marryed Isabel Barlow a good woman, had her his 
wife 40 yeares, but had no child by her, she dyed of a Cancer 
in her breast, 1667 he marryed Joanna Mason to his later wife, 
with whom he liued 9 yeares and she had no child, but at last 
she conceived, bare a child, Decemb 22 1677 it was baptized 
John Dec 24 77 : its father being at that time 75 yeares of 
age, the mother 34 : he had a second son called Nathaneel 
baptized june 21 1680 : but he dyed young: the father also 
dyed july 38 was buryed at Bolton july 31 1680 

However there was at once 6 couples of sons of the Hey- 
woods and no more 1 my father and Uncle 2 my brother 
Nat and I : 3 my fathers 2 sons by a a second wife, Thomas 
and Nathan 4 my uncle Johns two sons, John, Nath 5 My 
two sons John and Eliezer : 6 my brther Nathaniels 2 sons, 
Nathaniel and Richard, these two last couples through mercy 
are aliue, all the rest are dead, except John one son of my old 
uncles 

Richard Heywood my dear father was born (as I suppose, 
for the Register at Bolton was lost in the late warrs) about

the year 1596 he was brought up with his father in the ordi- 
nary way of weaving fustians, the great trade of that countrey 
(although his father was a Carpenter) : god sent a godly-zealous 
minister to Cockey-chappel, about a mile from his house, by 
whose preaching many were convinced and converted ; it 
pleased the Lord to awaken the heart of this Richard Heywood, 
when he was but 19 yeares of age :, so that ever after that he 
associated himself with gods people, promoted days of fasting 
and of prayer, conference and other Christian Excercises : In 
my childhood I can Remember many days of that nature and 
the Apparitor searching them out, and one appointed in the 
Entry to deafen the noyse of such as were praying in the 
parlour. 

I shall never forget one passage which Luke Hoil told since 
I came to Coley, he saith that in those times before the warres 
there was a private fast in my fathers little parlour, my uncle 
Francis Critchlaw was at prayer, pleading with god for the 
church, immediatly a great flaming light shone, aboue the 
brightnes of the sun, he ceased praying, they all lay astonisht 
lor the space of a quarter of an houre or more, he said, — while 
one might haue gone to the other side of the little medow and 
back again, then disappeared, which they interpreted to be a 
token for good, and so it proved : 

He raarryd Alice Critchlaw of Longworth in Bolton-parish, 
A D 1615 he being 19 yeares of age and she 21 Mr Alexander 
Horrocks preaching a nuptiall sermon, they had nine children 
John, who dyed about a year old, Hanna, after marryed to 
Thomas Crompton, Mary marryed to Nicholas Hunt of Har- 
wich, John who marryed Mary Rambsbothom, Esther marryd 
to William Whitehead, Oliver marryed Mr Angiers daughter, 
Alice marryed to Samuel Bradly, Josiah, never marryed : while 
these children were young it pleased the Lord to blesse him 
greatly in his calling, trading in Cottons, he had answered for 
anothers debt was brought into a snare, endangered by Arrests 
they removed from their own house to the Walk-mill for 
secrcy, contined there a year — they fared barely workt hard, 
were oft put to their shifts, but that year wherin I was born 
they were extricated out of debt and trading to London in 
fustians increasing Exceedingly bought much land, gaue por- 
tions to his 4 daughters sunk colepits, builded houses, main- 
tained 2 sons at London, 2 at the university and god did

greatly increase his state. But he changed his calling from 
fustian to Wolien-cloth, bought at Ratchall, mill’d it at his 
own mill, dresst it, sold it at London, wherby he knew he got 
much money, yet went behind through the prodigality of his 
factor at London spent wastfully, made debts, returned Bills 
unpaid, sometimes twice paid ruined his Master and himself : 
this together with his son Johns housekeeping building a 
stone-barn out of the stock Josiahs prodigality, his own old 
age forgetfulnes, but chiefly the hand of god took away as well 
as gaue, he was cast into 1200 li debt : but by the blessing of 
god and care and pains of some Relations, he got wrestled 
thorough, and paid to the full, the most considerable debts, 
and sold most of his land, bis troubles commenced with mini- 
sters silencing A D 1662 : In the greatest straits he met with 

he had a contented mind his conscience did not upbraid him 
with unfaithfull dealing, justifying god humbling his soul for 
sin, seeking peace and reconcilation with god a willingnes to 
part with all he had to satisfy creditors, and they had patience 
with him till he could dispose of his lands, and cordiall use of 
all diligent endeavoures to extricat himself out of this Laby- 
rinth and the matter was brought about to great satisfaction. 

This good old man had various Afflictions and difflcultys to 
encounter besides what befell him in his younger days, one of 
which was very peculiar which scarce admits a paralell : 

The case was this : 

Anno Domini 1647 or therabouts the Presbiterian govern- 
ment was established in Lancashire, every congregation had 
its Eldership, severall congregations had their classis, and once 
in a larger time they maintained Entercourse by a provincial! 
Assembly for all the county, which was usually at Preston, to 
which were made Appeales, who determined differences : 

Now at Bolton (where R H had his habitation, where he had 
joyned in Communion) there were two Ministers Mr John 
Harper and Mr Richard Goodwin (who marryed my present 
wflues Elder Sister) to whom were joyned 12 Elders chosen out 
of the town and severall parts of that large parish, these sate 
with the ministers, carryd their votes inquired into the conver- 
sation of their neighbours, sate usually with the ministers 
when they examined communicants, tho ministers only ex- 
amined, yet the Elders approved them : Both together made 

an order that every communicant, as oft as he was to partake 



79 



Beyioood Family. 

of the Lords supper should come to some of the Ruling Elders 
on the fridav before and demand and receiue a ceartain Ticket, 
which they were fco deliver in to the Elders, immediatly before 
their participating of that ordinance this Ticket was of lead 
with a stamp upon it, the design of this by-law was, that they 
might know that none intruded themselues but such as were 
first admitted, the Elders going through the congregation, 
taking these tickets of the people in the church, from whom 
they must fetch them the next oppertunity, which was every 
month : but this became an occasion of great dissention in the 
congregation, for severall conscientious Christians did stumble 
at it, for severall refused to come for Tickets, yet did venture 
to sit down, and when the Elders came they had no tickets to 
giue in whether those were passed I am not ceartain : R H 
was one of these Ti eke ties persons, and because they judged 
him as the chief Ringleader of this faction of Schismaticks 
wherupon they singled him out only, and summoned him to

Reasons against that practice, 1 bee. theres neither 1 precept

ministers Elders and people in endeavouring to prepare their 
own and other’s for a due participation of that sacred ordi- 
nance : These and such like Reasons he exhibited in writing 

to the presbitery i e the ministers and Elders at Bolton : but

these did not satisfy them, and what they said did not satisfy 
him : they sent severall times for him, he came, many disputes 
they had upon this occasion, for they had nothing Else to lay 
to his charge, at last they admonisht him, and when they saw 
him still resolute that he would not revoke his Errour, they 
suspended him from the Lords supper : which was for con- 
tempt : as they construed it, because he could not in conscience 
comply, but they said he laught them to scorn but he hauing 
naturally a smiling countenance, possibly he might smile in 
his discourses with them : his dear tender spirited wife would 

liaue had him yeeld to them for peace-sake : but he darst not 
in point of conscience, Roger Roscow, Robert Crompton, and 
some others, though they approved what he did, and they did 
incourage him, yet did not much appear but held off out of 
policy or cowardice : so that he was left alone, to struggle with 
them which he did very manfully : 

Being in this great strait shut out from the communion of 
gods people, he knew not what to doe but first applys himself 
to god, Appealing to god for the righteousnes of his cause, 
confessing his sin, and begging pardon, getting his heart 
nearer to god, and begging concel in this arduous case con- 
sulted Christian friends, and at last was resolved to make his 
Appeal to the Classicall presbitery of Ministers and Elders, 
meeting at Bury, there the matter was debated a considerable 
time. And though the Classis was dissatisfyel with the pro- 
ceedings of the Eldership at Bolton, yet they were loath to 
censure them, only desired them to passe it by and admit him 
to the Lords supper again but when they trifled about it and 
did nothing, R H made his Appeal from the Classicall presbi- 
tery at Bury to the provincial! Assembly at Preston, and after 
the busines had been stated and debated there, they made an 
order that the congregationall Eldership at Bolton should 
revoke the sentence of suspension of R H publickly admit 
him again into fellowship with them, exhorting both sides to 
mutuall accommadation &amp;c and (as I remember) by this time 
the occasion of this contention was laid aside, and I think 
tickets were never used after : But when this order came to 

the Ministers and Elders at Bolton they somthing stickled at 
his Restauration without submission however they were bound 
to obey the Order of the provinciall Assembly, and at last 
framed a paper, which was read in the church, wherin they

freed R H from his suspension, but withall gaue some hints 
therin as though he had submitted himself, which he did not, 
and so it was not at all satisfactory, and I think he never 
joyned with them in the Lords supper afterwards, but was en- 
tertained at Cockey fa mile nearer him then Bolton), and at 
all other places about, and maintained private communion in 
days of fasting and prayer both in Bolton parish and elsewhere. 

This is a true and short account of that unhappy difference : 
Behold how great a flame a little spark may kindle : I writ 
many papers for him in 1648 as Replys to the Eldership at 
Bolton, and some Appeals which I haue now forgot. This con- 
troversy continued some yeares, it was hot, begot much bad 
blood, many animositys amongst good people and opened the 
mouths of haters of Religion, that for such a trifling busines, 
such a good man should be cast out ; it divided the whole 
society into partys, some taking one side some the other it 
broke the heart of his good wife who was all for loue and sub- 
mission but he insisted upon his integrity often alledged that 
of Job 27 2 — 6 it was indeed a great Affliction to his spirit, 
which yet he bore with invincible courage, and managed with 
great wisdom and sobrity few would haue been found so 
capable of defending Christian liberty at that rate ; Whether 
this was well done in them to impose, or in him to oppose, I 
leaue it : he and they are gone to appear before the impartiall 
judg, not one left, that I remember wherin there was any thing 
done amisse on either side (and tis very rarely but in such con- 
troversys both sides may misse it in the manner of managing) 
I hope god hath pardoned it, and accepted and saved the soules 
of them that were good : 

It were Endles, to relate all the troubles R H went through, 
and the remarkeable deliverances he had in these 14 yeares of 
his troublesom captivity, viz from the year 1662 to 1*670: his 
troubles and poore ministers commencing together but god put 
an end to his debts and danger severall yeares before he dyed 
so that he liued quietly and comfortably with his second wife, 
Margaret Breertou (yet liuing at the writing herof, which is 
1695). But as to his debts, daugers, Arrests, deliverances, the 
means and manner of his disintanglemt I leaue such as desire 
to see the same to the Reading of a little Book called Hey-

tenacious memory, of a plodding head, always contriving soni- 
thing, repairing, transposing, or building, he built a paper- 
mill a little before his falling into this debt, that cost him 
200 li which he designed for his 2d wife, but it came to naught : 
he diggd up grounds in many places to get coles, but never 
got any thing by it : yea it was observed, that as god pros- 
pered him exceedingly the middle of his dayes in every thing 
lie undertook, so towards the later End of his days, god frus 
trated, blasted and crossed him in every thing he went about, 
doubtles it was to take his heart off the world and to prepare 
him for heaven : 

He was of a strong vigorous and healthfull constitution of a 
sanguine complexion, naturally very chearfull of an affable, 
sociable, louing temper he was seldom sick but sore sick sub- 
ject to leavers, and if any time he was seized with sicknes, he 
was somewt hearties, and conceited he must dye : 

About two yeares before he dyed, wn he was 70 yeares of 
age he took a journey to London, which was upon this occa- 
sion. One Bichard Wats liuing at Loten common, a great 
tradesman was intangled in a troublesom suit at London, 
about an account betwixt him and another to the value of 4 
or 500li, he lookt on E H as a competent witnesse for him, 
and prevailed with him to goe, provided for him a pretty 
pacing mare, bore his charges, kept him well they travelled 
together about 20 miles a day, most of his Eelations knew 
nothing of his journey, till he sent a letter that he was at 
London, feb 1 1674 signifying that he was well, and kindly 
entertained, his own cozen german Mr Nath Hilton (whom E 
H had sent up to London as his factor, maintained him there, 
now grown a very rich man) spake very comfortably to him, 
askt him what he would haue done, he Answered nothing 
except they would make an End with Eobert Harper (which 
was a pretended debt of 40 li tho not one farthing owing by 
E H) this they undertook to doe, and did it effectually, though 
to his and their wrong, but he had got E H and some of his 
Eelations iuto a snare : this E Harper (dark of Bolton, but 
could not officiate by reason of debt), was found dead in 
Charles acre, in the night feb 7 1676-7 about a month before 
EH dyed : he pretended this debt was due to the Orphans of 
Thomas Eivington, for whom he was a Trustee, but spent 
what he got wastfully, upon his drunken carcasse : But

manuin de fabula I shall say no more of that troublesom 
busines : 

When my very dear and honoured father went with me first 
to Cambridg Oh what care did he expresse of my good ! what 
prayers did he put up for me ! what serious advice did he giue 
me, viva voce : and after he had placed me in the best m anner 
he could by the advice of Dr Hill, and Mr Birchall his servant, 
when he left me he writ these instructions which he left with 
me 

1 My son labour aboue all things to make your peace with 
god, by humbling your soul evening and morning, and oftener 
before him, that you may know god hath begun a good work 
of grace in your heart 

2 Labour to get every day some sanctifyed thoughts, and 
spirituall meditations, which is an heavenly life and walking 
with god, and write them in a Book, and Title it, The medita- 
tions of my youth 

3 Be very frequent in reading the scriptures, with knowledg 
and understanding, that you may be a good scribe, armed 
against temptations and able to resist gainsay ers 

4 Take short notes of every sermon and write some fair 
over for your louing mother : 

5 Often Remember how short and precious your time is, 
and that upon it depends Eternity : 

6 Keep a mean neither be too solitary lest you be melan- 
choly, nor too much desire company, lest you be drawn aside 

7 And aboue all take of bad company and seek out for good : 

He was not so flashy and full of Affection as some Christians, 

but he was sober, solid, and well fixed in principles and prac- 
tices of Religion very judicious in his Answers to questions in 
stated conferences, and in discourse with ministers and Chris- 
tian friends : many days of prayer haue I known him keep 
among gods people yea I remember a whole night wherin he 
Dr Brads!) a Adam Ferniside, Thomas Crompton and severall 
more excellent men did pray all night in a parlour at Ralph 
Whittels, as I remember upon occasion of K Charles I de- 
manding the flue members of the house of commons, such a 
night of prayers, teares, groans as 1 was never present at in all 
my life : the case was extraordinary, and the work was extra- 
ordinary •

merit, capacity and interest, when in the year 1644 upon the 
death of Mr Gregg Vicar of Bolton, they sent R H into the 
low couutreys, with a message to Mr Robert Park (formerly 
vicar of Bolton) then preacher to the English Congregation at 
Roterdam thither he went, visited Amsterdam and other places 
in Holland, dispatcht his busines effectually, had a promise 
from Mr Park to come in convenient time, who did come 
within a year or therabouts, settled at Bolton till ejected by 
Bartolomew Act, liued there till he dyed : R H returned 

shortly, at his landing at Hull, was welcomed with the aston- 
ishing tidings of Prince Ruperts taking of Bolton killing man 
woman and child as it was represented to him : he came by 
Hessah moor after the battel 1 there, saw a lamentable spectacle 
of multitudes slain, stript, the saddest object that ever his 
eyes beheld : he often mentioned it : 

When he was abroad his designe and practice was to hear 
the best preachers : he travelled to London once or twice every 
year, and he constantly heard old Mr Edmund Calamy at Aider- 
man Bury, Mr Thomas Case, and such like : his practice at 
London was still to furnish himself with the best Bookes, the 
most plain, practicall experimentall Treatises in Divinity such 
as Calvin, Luther in English Mr Perkins, Dr Preston, Dr Sibs 
wherin he took much pleasure in reading : When prince 

Ruperts forces took Bolton and ranged all* the countrey over 
my sisters had conveyed them away into colepit-house, hid 
them under piles of W T ood, but they found them, carryed them 
away, and tis said, burnt them on Cockey moor, but they were 
never heard of to this day : 

R II had injoyed a great measure of health most part of his 
dayes only when he was at any time sick he was sore sick, and 
made account he must dye, he had been at Leverpool the winter 
before he dyed upon speciall occasion : he had often said, I 
will goe to my two sons, in Yorkshire and at Ormskirk, and 
continue with them, a month with the one, and another month 
with the other, but still put it off : his son Nathaneel came 
over to him at that time called Christmas, stayd a fourtnight 
on that side, lodged severall nights with him, conversed famili- 
arly wnh him preacht in his house a lords-day and was longer 
with him then he had been aboue 20 yeares, and was much 
affected in his company 

About this time he got severall Ministers to spend the Lords

day in his own house, in preaching and prayer, upon the 
Lords day before he dyed, when he lay sick, Mr Aspinall 
preacht, prayd, discoursed with him, that day and muuday 
morning and had good satisfaction from him : 

Severall months before he dyed he was much affected with 
the sense of gods great goodnes to him, and greatly drawn out 
in thankfulnes to god in his prayers : yea he appointed severall 
days of solemne thanksgiuing, on which he desired the help of 
Christian friends, and neighbours and was much inlarged upon 
those days : 

A good man told me, that the last day he was with him 
upon that occasion, he prayed and praised god with so much 
affectionatenes and so many teares, as did much affect his 
heart, and others that joyned with him, his soul-mercy s were 
many and singular, and the late signall appearance of provi- 
dence in extricating him out of those intanglements in which 
he was involved, setting his feet in a large room, so that he 
could goe in and out in so much peace and safety : 

I came to him on Febr 22 1676-7 and found this my dear 
and honoured father sick in his bed, I was much surprized with 
fear, and suspected, (as it proved) that he was sick unto death : 
he had been abroad on munday and thought he got some cold 
by being too thin of cloths, this was upon thursday following : 
he had a sore caugh and a stopping, got up much flegm, he 
told me, he was wonderfull weak, however god would deal with 
him, that he was never in that condition before, and was wait- 
ing gods pleasure I askt him how it was with him as to the 
state of his soul, he chearfully answered in these words [It is 
now threescore and two yeares since god shewed me my wofull 
condition by nature, and helpt my heart to lay hold on Christ, 
and though I haue had many failings in the course of my life, 
yet I hope I can say, I never took my leaue of Jesus Christ] 
these words so sensibly spoken did greatly melt my heart : we 
discoursed further about soul-concernments : he complained 
that he had gone frequently to private dayes of fasting and 
prayer, but carryed an hard, stupid, distracted heart, notwith 
standing fair pretences that of late god had much withdrawn 
himself from him, in secret addresses to him which did much 
trouble him, he said, in my family and with others god doth 
in some measure assist me, but I find not his presence by my- 
self as I could desire, and I haue been guilty of many sins ; 



86 



Heywood Family . 



but I will stick to my Lord Jesus, and lye at his feet, let him 
doe with me as seemes good in his eyes 

We discoursed also of some worldly things, he told me, he 
had been lately searching the writings of that house and land 
where he liued, and found himself utterly mistaken, for he 
made full account it had been entailed upon the heires male, 
and then it would haue descended me, being his second son, 
for his son John was dead beyond sea, his granson Richard 
Heywood was dead, and his great granson John Heywood w r as 
also dead a little while before, so that there were no heires 
male left of his son but there were two daughters Esther and 
Mary (which since then haue marryed two honest men, and 
haue either of them seven children) I told him I saw no reason 
why females might not heir land as well as males and I was 
glad it fell to them but if it had fallen on me I should haue 
giuen them the worth of it, so he acquiesced : 

We discoursed of many other things that night, so parted, I 
put him into gods hands by prayer, and he slept much, yet in 
the morning when I came to him, I perceived his strength was 
much abated, and his memory failed him, going often over 
with the same things : I told him that my necessary occasions 
called me away and I must leaue him : I confesse god did 
more then ordinarily assist my heart, both in prayer, and in 
expounding part of Job 33 both my sisters, Esther and Alice, 
and several 1 other friends and Relations being present : there 
was a solemn parting, and a flood of teares, seldom hath my 
heart been in such a melting frame, reflecting upon his more 
then ordinary care of me and prayers for me, when I could 
not or did not pray for my self : with much adoe, I parted 
from him about two or 3 a clock in the afternoon on friday 
feb 23 1676-7 lodged at Ratchdall that night, preacht at home 
on Lords day, at I B in Warly on tuesday, at Idle in the 
chappel there on Wednesday immediatly after my return home 
on thursday night a messenger came to acquaint me with his 
death the morning of that very day, which was March 1 1676-7 
friday morning I went with the messenger, found it so, they 
told me how he dy ed, even just as he had foretold, for he had 
often said, he thought he should dye without any sicknes or 
pain, which proved so, for he slept quietly most of the night 
before, and about break of day called for somthing to wet his 
mouth, which, while his wife v 7 as fetching, he opened his

mouth twice as with a yawning or yalking and breathed his 
last, without noyse or groan or the least struggling : Upon 

Saturday March 3 the funeralls were solemnized at Bolton 
according to the decent and orderly custom of the countrey, 
in attending funerals his son Nathaneel meeting us there from 
Ormschurch. 

Mr John Tilsly (who had done somthing to satisfy BP Wil- 
kins, and keept his publick station at Dean-church; preached 
the funei all sermon in Bolton church upon 2 Tim 1 12 [I 
know whom I haue believed, and I am persuaded that he is 
able to keep that which I haue committed unto him against 
that day] which words a dear sister of mine obseruing our 
good father frequently making use of, did recommend to him 
as the subject of that discourse, which Mr Tilsely did very 
chearfully, and was resolved to giue us his paines, out of a 
dear respect (as he said) to the good old man, that was gone 
and to us his sons : the day after being Lords day I preached 
in Coekey-chappel upon Rev 10 5 [that time shall be no 
longer] oh that it would please god ro bring in some soul of 
our Relations to fill up this vacancy, and stand up in his room, 
to doe our dear Lord some acceptable service : 
on Munday I sent to search the Register at Bolton, for the 
time of his Baptizing but the could not find it, 5 or 6 leaues 
being torn out, and lost about those yeares, only they found 
John Heywood the son of Oliver Heywood baptized A D 1592, 
who, I perceiue was his Elder brother, and a younger son, 
John Heywood of Chappel several: yeares younger, 7 yeares 
younger then R H so R H age is 81 or 82 as we guesse : 

R H passed through variety of conditions and dispensations 
with such eavenes, and (equanimity of spirit, as I haue seldom 
known, being not lifted up in prosperity beyond what was 
meet, nor too much cast down in adversity he bore all his 
troubles with an invincible spirit, god wonderfully upheld him 
and I doubt not sanctifyed his troubles for the bettering of his 
heart : he had a good report of ali men and of the truth itself : 
he lyes buryed about the middle of the church-yard at Bol- 
ton, a hansom graue-stone is laid on him, with the form of a 
wool pack graven on it with this inscription 

Here lyeth the body of Richard Heywood of little Leaver

MEMORANDUM. 



In May 1785, Samuel Heywood of Nottingham, a lineal 
Discendant of those whose Lives are recorded in tin’s Book, 
caused the same to be bound as it now is, in hopes that its 
Exterior may hereafter preserve it from neglect. 

NB. The first part of the Book, entitled lt Hey wood’s 
Family,” was only secured in common brown Paper before it 
had its present Cover. 

The Copies of the Wills of Oliver Heywood and Abigail his 
Widow are the hand writing of my Grandfather Eliezer Hey- 
wood, who died and was buried at Dronfield in Derbyshire in 
1730, as was my Grandmother Helen Heywood in 1713. 

There is no Picture Grave Stone or Monument to preserve 
their Names. Let this then tell that they were respected in 
their day by all who knew them and worthily filled up their 
Station in life. My Grandfather was Chaplain to Mr. Taylor 
and Mr White of Wallingwells which is on the borders of 
Nottinghamshire and Yorkshire. When he married, which 
was 1st January 1700, he went to live at Carlton, from whence 
he removed in 1703 or 1704 to Dronfield, where he preach’d 
till near the time of his Death. He was succeeded at Dron- 
field as the Dissenting Minister there by my Grandfather 
Shaw, who afterwards removed to Mansfield and died there in 
1748. 

My Father was born at Dronfield 8th October 1710, was 
educated under Mr. Wadsworth Dissenting Minister of Shef- 
field. In 1729 he went to London and was under the Tuition 
of Dr. Ridgley there. His Father’s declining Health caused 
him to leaue London in March 1730. 

S: Heywood 

My father Eliezer Heywood, Grandson of Oliver Heywood 
died at Mansfield the 22d of July 1783 aged seventy three 
years. The following was the character of him in the Not- 
tingham paper. 

“ On Wednesday last died at Mansfield in this county, greatly 
respected by all who knew him, the Revd: Mr Heywood, who 
for 33 years had been Minister to the Congregation of protes- 
tant dissenters in that Town — When a Man distinguished for 
the purity of his life, and the amiableness of his manners, is

removed from the circle of our intelligence, it is a duty we 
owe the public to pay his character that respect which is its 
Due ; and in this view we place the late Mr: Hey wood, whose 
religion was not that of a bigotted churchman, or a fanatical 
sectarist, who exclude from the pale of salvation the followers 
of every Mode of worship but their own ; but as he believed, 
so he taught, that honest and sincere Men of all Denomina- 
tions, were the objects of regard to that Being whose eye is 
over all. His piety consisted not in ostentatious devotion but 
shew’d itself in works of humanity, in a settled habit of chear- 
fulness, and by promoting as far as in him lay, the happiness 
of all abound him. His natural and honest warmth of temper 
was seldom exerted but in the cause of virtue or of Liberty. 
He hated oppression in any form, and therefore was led to ex- 
press himself in indignant language against those whom he 
considered as ks abettors. He possessed a Mind above being 
swayed by wo? Idly Interests ; as he thought, so he spoke, re- 
gardless of the consequences to himself. These being the 
leading features of his conduct, we need not wonder that he 
was enabled to bear a long illness with the composure of a 
Christian. No repining word was ever heard to escape his lips. 
His life was innocent, his death exemplary, and his Memory 
will long be had in grateful Remembrance.” 



Samuel Heywood son of Eliezer Hey wood, of Mansfield, and 
Great Grandson of Oliver Heywood, died at Nottingham in 
the year 1789, he left a widow and two children Mary, and 
•Eliezer, Ann was born in September after her poor fathers 
death, it was this dear Brother Samuel of mine that had this 
Book bound together in hopes that it might be preserved, and 
a kind good Man he was. — 

“ Last Saturday died at Notting: Mr Samuel Heywood 
Attorney at Law, in the thirty fifth year of his age. He was 
descended from Ancestors respected thro’ several generations 
for their wisdom &amp; integrity, and he did honor to the race he 
sprang from. He lived long enough to arrive at eminence in 
his profession ; and to attract to himself as much esteem, con- 
fidence, and affection, as almost ever falls to the lot of any one 
in a private station. — Hut great as his Attainments were at so 
early a period, they were but the promise of what his acquain- 



94 Heyicood Family. 

tance and friends expected from him. His knowledge extended 
for beyond the line of his profession ; his conversation was 
pleasant, lively, &amp; instructive ; as a husband, a son, a Brother, 
and a friend the writer of this hardly ever knew his equal ; 
while to his other virtues he added the character of a sincere 
Christian, with the piety and Devotion of one. He is deeply 
lamented and will be long remember’d with regret, affection 
and Gratitude.” 

M: H 

[In Mr. 0. H.’s writing :] 

When I was sitting in mine own house on Lords day-night 
Sept 22 1G78, musing upon mine own death, and thinking on 
those thousands of blessed soules that have broke the yce and 
gone before me into that celestiall city, many of my godly re- 
lations that dyed in the Lord came afresh into my thoughts. 
I at last resolved to make a Catalogue of them that are within 
my cognizance or remembrance, partly to maintain the memory 
of the just, partly to comfort mine own heart, that any, yea so 
many of my kinred in the flesh were gracious, and are now 
glorifyed, saints, whom I hope to meet in heaven,, partly to 
recommend them to the observation and imitation of my sons, 
and their seed, that they may see what a religious stock they 
are branches of, that they or theirs may never degenerate, but 
walk in the same steps, that their ancestours found peace in and 
rest in the end of : nor shall I goe further then wel-grounded 
charity according to the scriptures will admit, of some of them 
hauing been more then ordinarily eminent in their generations, 
others very hopelull plants of renown, and I more value my 
parentage for godlines then greatnes, Religion then riches : 
1 Oliver Hey wood, my fathers father, my dear and precious 
grand-father, after wm they named me, who lived soberly and 
civilly most part of his days, a good-natured man, but carnall, 
used to goe a shooting on Sabboth-days in the afternoon on 
Lomas mosse (now inclosed) in little Leaver, and did not ex- 
presse any forwardnes in Religion, his wife (being a good 
woman) desired Mr llubbert (then minister at Cockey an 
eminent man of god) to speak to her husband to pray in his 
family, who (calling as he went to little Leaver) said Oliver, 
You must read the word of god and pray with your family &amp;c 
he answered ay Sr, none of those things shall be wanting lie

doc what I can and what is fitting, but he neglected still, at 
last when he was 60 yeares of age going to B ary-fair where 
Mr Paget preached, he went into the church, heard him, god 
laid hold on his hart, convinced his conscience, and brought 
him savingly home to himself, he became an eminent Christian, 
followed Mr Paget to Blakley Chappel, where he preach t (as 
he told me, when he was parson of Stopport in his old age) as 
long as he lived, he was of a sweet winning disposition, made 
up of ioue, much addicted to secret prayer and meditation, 
when my mother hath called him to dinner &amp;c he would liaue 
said, Ah Alice what hurt hast thou done me, to rob me of my 
god, — he dyed aboue 59 yeares agoe, some time before I was 
born, but many haue told me he was one of a thousand — 

2 Alice Heywood, his wife, my grandmother, who was a 
religious zealous Christian, as I haue heard though I cannot 
say that I doe remember her, yet I haue heard good characters 
of her, and such passages as demonstrate som thing of god 
upon her heart, that put her husband unto what was good, in 
the former part of their time, but was oatstript by him in the 
latter part of their days togather, yet I hope god was pleased 
to own her : 

3 Mary Heywood, their daughter, my aunt, who (as I haue 
heard) was a very precious woman, who dyed when I was but a 
child, and was lame of her feet, but travelled apace in heavens 
road, and I am persuaded is safely landed there, many yeares 
agoe : 

4 Isabell Heywood, my uncle John Heywoods wife (Roger 
Barlows sister) was indeed a gracious woman very affectionate, 
importune in prayer kept up meetings of prayer, conference 
with other women her companions, my mother and she were 
indearefd much to each other, she sustained a sharp and tedious 
affliction of which she dyed wch was a Cancer in her breast 
about the year 1667, never had child; but was fruitfull in 
good works, and I am verily persuaded is transplanted into 
heaven : 

5 Adam Hukon, my grandmother Heywoods own brother 
was a holy solid Christian, who was witnes for me wn I was 
baptized (as the manner then was) much good haue heard of 
him, though I never knew him, he dedicated one son to god 
in the ministry, (William Hulton) who yet proved not accord- 
ing to expectation, late minister in Northamptonshire, but his

other son Nathaniel Hnlton is now an eminent useful! Christian 
at Newington green near London, an intimate friend of Mr 
Henry Ashursts, very wealthy hath laid out himself exceedingly 
for the good of ministers, widows, poor, and I hope will follow 
his religions father to heaven ; and his good mother, whom I 
knew to be a serious ancient Christian : 

6 Judith Heaward, daughter to Adam Hulton, wife to 
Samuel Heaward near Denton, formerly servant in my father 
Angiers family, a very gracious woman, she and her husband 
lived many yeares togather usefully, inoffensiuely in the serious 
practice of religion, whom I knew very well, god removed her 
husband several 1 yeares before her, he dyed in the faith, and 
she also dyed A d 1673, was a sincere upright-hearted saint, 
had 6 children. Mary her daughter was my first servant, a 
sincere Christian, she marryed John Knight of Stretford, they 
lived togather in gods fear, had 3 children, dyed both in a 
fortnights time, both of them left clear evidences of their 
happy condition ; and were very usefull in that barren place 
where they lived, kept up private days of prayer entertained 
ministers, and were willing to doe good to their neighbourhood, 
but god in judgment to the place, and in mercy to their owne 
soules took them away : 

7 Critchlaw, my mothers mother was a very gracious 
woman as I haue heard my mother say, that long travelled 
over my mother, her only daughter to see gods image formed 
in her heart, but never saw her prayer answered though imme- 
diatly after her death god laid hold upon her heart, which 
indeed was much occasioned at first by her death whom she 
dearly loved, and when her heart was therby softened god 
took this advantage to set his own stamp upon it wch never 
wore away — 

8 William Critchlaw, my mothers eldest brother was an 
affectionate, solid and zealous Christian, though the world did 
not favour him, in the latter end of his days he lived in my 
fathers family, I remember he would weep and wrestle, when 
he went to prayer in the family with extraordinary importunity. 
In the warre time, though he was not a souldier, yet when he 
heard of a fight night at hand, or a town to be taken by the 
Parliaments army he used to take his musket, and run to the 
army and be the formost in any hazardous expedition, which 
cost him his life, for when Colonel Holland, and Colonel Ashton

with their regiments went to take Wigan, though the town 
was taken yet this zealous champion got shot into the shoulder, 
and another bullet was in the thigh, he was brought to his 
daughters in Bolton, and there about a fortnight after dyed of 
those wounds, but with invincible courage, uttering many 
gracious expressions near his end, indeed he was of an un- 
daunted spirit : hauing made his peace with god, and living in 
assured hopes of heaven he feared not death : 

9 John Busick, who marryed my Uncle William Critchlaws 
younger daughter, was a singular good man, though but poor 
in the world, yet rich in faith, he lived and dyed in Bolton, had 
a sensible spirit, groaned much after the salvation of his rela- 
tions, left me a text to preach upon as a funerall sermon, wch 
at present I haue forgot, he dyed about 12 years agoe, and left 
an hopefull son, wch dyed not long after him, little can I say 
for the rest of relations, though Henry Marsden, and his wife 
Mary (my uncle AVill Critchlaws elder daughter) were pro- 
fessours and I hope godly though my unacquaiutednes with 
(as to intimacy) ingageth me to say lesse of them : they lived 
and dyed in Longworth, in the house wherin my good mother 
was born : 

10 Francis Critchlaw, my mothers second brother, was a 
sincere, resolute, zealous Christian, my grandfather used to say 
of him, this lad that comes out of the moores hath more zeal 
then you all, he was my intimate dear friend, I scarce ever 
was in his company without sensible advantage, he was very 
usefull in discourse, especially in asking pertinent and profit- 
able questions with wch he was furnished abundantly in his 
younger days, in those frequent conferences they maintained, 
he was indeed a very judicious, solid experienced Christian, a 
Mnason, an old disciple, long trained in the school of Christ, 
very powerfull in prayer, pithy, short. I haue heard Luke 
Hoyle (my good old dear friend) tell a strange relation that in 
the parlour at my fathers house, at a private fast, many elders 
being present, when my uncle Francis was at prayer, wonder- 
fully carryed out in affection and strong wrestlings, all on a 
sudden, a bright shining light, far brighter then the sun shone 
in the room, it dazzled and astonisht them all, my uncle gaue 
over, they rose off their knees, were amazed, sd nothing, but 
lookt one upon another, hear no voyce, it continued aboue a 
quarter of an hour, as long as one might haue gone to the

further side of the little medow and back again as Luke Hoyl 
hath told me, who was there present, this was a little before 
the warrs, in the heat and height of the Bishops’ tyranny over 
godly ministers, some wherof fled into Holland, others into 
New-England, and I can remember something of the warm 
spirit of prayer in those days, though I knew nothing of the 
forementioned passage, but this I can wel remember, that when 
at my fathers house they had a private fast when I w T as a child, 
they set me a singing, about doores, that when the paratour, 
(one A Ilulton) came he might not hear them pray : this my 
good uncle Francis was the instrument to bring me to be 
Minister at Coley, in Yorkshire, for coming over to see some 
friends here, he acquainted them that I preacht, Luke Hoyl, 
and Anthony Wilson came over for me, this time 28 yeares 
agoc, viz at Micaelmas (wch is this week, A d 1678 :) as that 
was 1650 : and I never had cause to repent my coming : this 
same good uncle Fr: also brought my father Angier into Lan- 
cashire, where he continued 46 yeares: this good man, who 
indeed was one of a thousand, (though low in the world) was 
about 70 when he dyed, wch was about the year 1669 : I 
preacht his funerall sermon at Bradshaw chappel on gen 50 24 
May 18 1669 : his death was seasonable and sweet to him, but 
much lamented by all that knew him : 

11 Hugh Critchlaw, a third brother of my mothers, a good 
man, though the world did not doe in his hands neither, he 
travel’d to, and lived some time at Shrewsbury, at last got safe 
to his journeys end, I hope : a little man, very purblind, of a 
very sweet loving temper, though not so zealous as his other 
brothers : 

12 Ralph Critchlaw, my mothers youngest brother, the most 
proper witty man of them all, he marryed Mr Crosses sister (a 
worthy minister, who was preacher at Friday street-church in 
London, with whom I haue preacht there) that marriage occa- 
sioned my uncle to travel abroad, and at last settled at Wrexam 
in Wales, where he kept a grocers shop, got a great estate, 
was justice of peace in the states times, when I went first to 
visit him, a godly man, tho possibly not much better for his 
greatnes, yet 1 beleeue a savour of godlines abode on his heart 
lo his dying day, those four brothers and some other Christians 
kept meetings togather in their younger days for conference 
and player, and when they spent time in prayer, they ordered

it so as one spent such a time in confessing sin, another in 
begging personall mercys, another in begging publick niercys, 
another in thanksgiving &amp;c in which work they took liberty 
to expatiate themselues, and found wonderfull assistance and 
inlargemt and many signall returnes of prayer : this Uncle 
Ralph had one son called Joseph, and several religious 
daughters, some wherof are living at this day, himself dyed 
about the year 1659 : his wife and his son dyed since : 

13 Alice Rigby mother to my cozen Mary Holt in Bolton, 
was my mothers own cozen, a precious woman, one of a thou- 
sand, living with Susanna Lee in little Bolton, where my 
brother and I were tabled when we went to Bolton schoole. 
She lived a widow many yeares. She was a mighty wrestler 
with god an humble, serious, self-denying soule, much in com- 
munion with god, strong in faith, fruitfull in good works, 
patient in afflictions, usefull in her generation, went to rest 
many years agoe, her daughter following her steps though 
through manifold afflictions : 

14 Richard Hey wood my oun dear father, who told me upon 
his death-bed, that 64 yeares before that god had convinced 
him of his undone state, drawn out his heart to close with Cht 
and though he had many failings, yet to that day he never 
took his leaue of Christ, he dyed March 1 1676-7 whose life 
I haue elsewhere writ, 

15 Alice Hey wood my own dear mother, whose life, is writ 
in this book, both at rest with god : 

16 Hanna Crompton, Thomas Cromptons wife, my eldest 
sister, living in Breakmit, a very upright-hearted, zealous 
woman, of a savoury spirit, plain-hearted, she was wrought on 
young, and my mother sd of her she had as much comfort in 
her as one could haue in a child, for since her conversion, she 
never had occasion to call it in question, oh what days had 
mother and daughter togather in prayer, she had much faith, 
much loue, patience, self-denyal, tendernes of spirit, she dyed 
Dec 4 1673 

17 Thomas Crompton her husband, was a man of singular 
parts and piety, stupendious memory, a forward professor that 
constantly attended dutys of fasting and prayer, yet (as I ob- 
served) would not be persuaded to kneel upon a cushion when 
he went to prayer, something inclined to Melancholy, yet a 
good man, very humble and self-denying, understanding in all

away of a few days sicknes, April 26 1673 

18 John Crompton their eldest child, whom his father 
brought up a considerable time in his calling, (weaving fustian) 
but the youth had a great desire to be a schollar, they set him 
to school at Bolton with Mr Taylour, at Ormeskirk with Mr 
Chorley, he profitted exceedingly was sent to Cambridg, was 
admitted of Chts Oolledg under Mr Stanford, near at Kendal, 
but he not minding him, he frequented Mr Abr: Brooksbanks 
lectures, came oil wonderfully in all sorts of litterature, and 
indeed he was of admirable natural parts, very industrious, 
inquisitiue, and very covetous of learning, he profited beyond 
his equals, after he had taken his Batehlours degree he was 
chaplain to Mr Dymmocks at Symmonds-wood, in Lincolnshire, 
where he did good, getting that gentleman off from vain 
sports, training up his sons, he lived several yeares in that 
family, commenced Mr of Arts in Cambridg, marryed Mr 
Gibbons (that famous London ministers) widow, then he did 
something towards conformity, was Minister at Scremby, an 
excellent preacher, very sober in his conversation, diligent in 
his studys, he also taught schollars privately in his house, and 
was of very great use, his discourse with me and letters to me 
so far as 1 am able to judg spake him truely serious, thus he 
writes Dear uncle your serious cordial, and heart-affecting 
exhortations haue been always most welcomly entertained 
in my poor breast, and I hope it will please god (who 
keepeth covenant and mercy) to maintain and cherish by 
his spirit and blessing some of that finely sense and savoury 
rellish of religion and piety which hath so sweetly breathed in 
the soules of our pious ancestours, teaching us to know the 
god of our fathers &amp;c, but that low fenny countrey not being 
suitable to the temper of his frail body, diseases agues feavours

tabernacle Decemb 25 1675 about the 31th year of his age. 

19 Mary Pickup, his eldest sister, my sisters eldest daughter 
marrying one Robt Pickup near Tockhols chappel in Blackburn 
parish, was a very serious gracious young woman, forward for 
good things, bore a child, dyed in January 1672 — her child 
dying shortly after :

Horwich, was a woman of a very gracious spirit, she was a

comely person, as to the body, but her chiefest beauty was 
within, her disposition was very desirable, but the graces of 
the spirit shined illustriously in her, she gaue herself much to 
secret prayer, going every morning and evening into a poor 
coat by the fold-side and there easing her heart to god in 
prayer, but she was too good for this wicked world, god took 
her home betimes she dyed A D 1648, she left an only 
daughter, yet living, Ester Hunt, her father marryed again, 
had 6 sons by the latter wife, an honest man, he dyed A D 
1676, his wife also being dead before him 

21 John Hey wood, my eldest brother, was exceeding loving, 
plain-hearted, like my mother, and though in his younger days 
he was drawn aside by company, yet god (I am persuaded) did 
him saving good towards his end, he was very affectionate in 
his teares, groanes, prayers, hating wt he had before loved, and 
gaue signal! testimonys of a work of grace and I beleeue god 
remembred covenant for him, he went beyond sea into one of 
the English plantations, and dyed there sept 1664 about 38 
yeares of age, or 40 

22 Richard Heywood his son was something dull, heedles, 
conceited, fell into sin, but grace made use of some sharp rods 
to whip folly out of him, and driue him home to god ; he had 
a sore disease on his body called an itch, but it was a scurfe, 
like the leprosy, and he had sad tryals in his new condition, 
and oh what horrour of conscience had he, he even roared by 
reason of the disquietnes of his spirit, at last got hold of christ 
in a promise, and his mind was stayed on god, sober judicious 
Christians of the neighbourhood had very good hopes of his 
safe condition, tho he lived most of his time in much misery, 
yet that he dyed in the Lord, march 25 1675 : 

23 Alice Bradly my youngest sister marryed to Samuel 
Bradly, in Ainsworth, though her nature was rugged and 
knotty more then any of my fathers children, yet god in mercy 
awakened her conscience and smoothed her rough disposition 
by his grace, and by some affliction she had in her husband, 
(though tis verily hoped god did him saving good before his 
death, which was 8 yeares before his wife dyed) and rough 
timber must haue many blows to hew it even and fit for his 
building, she lived severall yeares a widow and met with many 
tryals with her 6 children, oh what bitter sorrow had shee for

had sold Bent-hall to Rowland Mitchel,) and had ten children, 
and no calling, removed into Lancashire now hues in Bolton,

good mother, and she being very tender and sickly could work 
little, I gaue her 3li a year for maintenance, she liued in a 
parlour by herself in Roger Crooks house that marryed her 
daughter Alice, went much abroad to private days in severall 
places, for her company and assistance was much desired in 
various societys wherin she was very usefuh, hauing excellent 
naturall parts, much grace, and great zeal and tendernes, very 
like her mother : going about doing good, she had perfected 
her work, and now had nothing else to doe but to dye, as fruit 
fully ripe dropt off: her disease was a weakening her strength 
by the way till her moyst humours were converted to drynes : 
she had somthing of a stitch, yet not violent, caused by and 
want of stool, all the lime of her sicknes she was of a composed 
frame she begun on tuesday night with a weaknes, indeed she 
had often complained of weaknes, the sabboth before she sd I 
must leaue coming, I am not able to come to Bolton (which 
was about a mile and half from her), on munday night she 
was very chearfull, and sd I am a great cheat, I can sit, and 
talk, folks would think I ailed nothing but let me rise I am 
not able to walk scarce over the floor ; her son William White- 
heads daughter had liued some time with her, she sent for 
him on thursday told him she must dye, told him to see her 
hansomly buryed, desired that Mr Robert Seddon would preach 
at her funerall from Micah 7 three last verses, he must giue 
him a piece of gold that she had, and kept by her for that 
purpose, she continued still gradually declining till about mid-

her acquaintance with such was not small : being much cheared 
in her sicknes by the constant concourse of such : she earnestly 
desired to dye, afraid (as she expressed it) to return into this 
dirty world : she sd she was neither ashamed of life nor afraid 
of death her desire to those that prayd for her was that the} 1

“ ’Tis possible,” says the pious Mr. Oliver Heywood in some 
private memoirs of his family, now in the possession of his 
descendant the Miss Heywood of Mansfield, “ we might spring 
“ from some younger brother of the house of Heywood of Hey- 
“ wood, an ancient Esquire’s seat betwixt Ratchdal and Bury : 
“ for old Mr. Robert Heywood (whom I knew), a pious, reverend, 
“ old gentleman, and an excellent poet, was wont to call my 
“ father Cozin : but kinship grows out in processe of time ; and 
“ tis not much materiall what family we are of, so that we be of 
“ the household of faith, and have God for our father, Christ 
“ for our elder brother, and the spirit of grace running in our 
“ veines and acting us for God.” 

The arms borne by the Heywoods of Heywood were Argent 
on a bend cotized Azure, 3 plates. They have been borne by 
several members of that family whose genealogy is here ensu- 
ing, with a falcon preparing to fly, on a wreath for the crest, 
and for a motto the words “ Alte volo ” ; with what authority 
must be left to themselves and the Heralds, till the connection 
is proved at which Mr. 0. Heywood hints in the above passage. 
To prove that connection would form a curious subject of 
enquiry. Here the parochial registers would furnish no assist- 
ance, the two families having separated before those valuable 
records were in use : but something might be done by those 
who have leisure and opportunities, by examining all the wills 
of the Heywoods in the prerogative court at Chester, near 
about the time of Henry VIII, by perusing some of the earlier 
title deeds of the Heywood and Little- Lever estates — to which 
something might perhaps be added from the first and second 
visitations of the county palatine of Lancaster. 

These hints are merely thrown out as a guide to any future 
enquiry. The authorities for what follows are the MSS. of 
venerable Oliver Heyw-ood for the earlier generations. He 
left a regular account of the occurrences in his family during 
the greater part of his long life, and has besides that left 
written memoirs of his grandfather and grandmother Oliver 
and x\lice Heywood as well as of several persons their kindred 
and descendants. These MSS. are now in the possession of 
Miss Heywood of Mansfield, who preserves them with a care 
worthy of their high value. 

For the later generations we are indebted to the present 
representatives of the several branches. A connection with the 



112 



Hunter's Pedigrees . 



family of Milnes led my late friend Mr. John Millies of Wake- 
field, the latter years of whose life were almost wholly devoted 
to genealogical enquiries to collect all the information he could 
meet with. He had recourse to Registers and Monumental 
inscriptions ; we find therefore almost every part of the pedi- 
gree which depends upon personal communications strengthened 
by references to these authorities. On the whole there are few 
families of this rank — a rank peculiarly dear to the genealogist, 
above the vulgar, yet below the magnates — which can present 
so full, so accurate, and so well-supported a pedigree as the 
Hey woods of Little-Leaver. 

Whoever wishes for a more full account of Mr. Oliver Hey- 
wood, the founder of the Mansfield and Gainsborough family, 
may consult the “ History of Halifax,” by the late Mr. John 
Watson, rector of Stockport, where a memoir of Mr. Hey wood 
is to be found, extending from p. 476 to 480. Additional par- 
ticulars of his useful life may be found in Dr. Edmund Calainy’s 
account of the ejected ministers, 804-809 — but especially re- 
course should be had to a 12mo volume published in 17 — by 
Mr. Fawcet of Ewood-hall, in the parish of Halifax, containing 
a pretty full account of his active life. These works are too 
common to render it necessary to transcribe from them in this 
place — indeed these particulars scarcely come within the pro- 
vince of the genealogist. 

Not so Mr. Heywood’s Life of his father-in-law, Mr. Angier 
of Denton, an eminent puritan minister. Some account of 
this gentleman may be found in Calamy Acct., p. 395, but 
much might doubtless be added to it, could that scarce and 
curious work be procured. As a genealogist I particularly 
regret that we have not its assistance on the present occasion, 
since there we should learn who was the wife of this Mr. Angier 
and mother of Mrs. Heywood, a lady of whom Calamy informs 
us that she was related to many of the superior gentry in the 
county of Lancaster ; but quere if the lady there spoken of 
were not Mr. Angier’s 2d wife Margaret Mozeley, sister to Sir 
Edward Mozeley of Hulme, Manchester, and who was not 
the mother of his children. 

Of the families of Rotherham and Shaw, ol whom were the 
wives of the two Eliezer Heywoods, some account will be found 
hereafter. In the church of Dronfield, in Derbyshire, is a 
brass plate pointing out the place of interment of the first

Eliezer. It contains a long Latin inscription giving a high 
character of Mr. Hey wood as a divine and a man. 

Of Mr. Samuel Hevwood, some account is to be found in the 
memoirs of Gilbert Wakefield, who was one of his more par- 
icular friends. He was a man exceedingly respected in Not- 
ingham, of which there are many testimonials besides the 
monument erected to his memory in Saint Mary’s Church, 
Nottingham, bearing this inscription : — 

To the memory of 
Mr. Samuel Hey wood, 

Attorney at law of this town, 

Who died July 25, 1789, aged 34. 

A man 

eminently respected in his day, 
and worthy to be remembered by posterity. 

In his profession 

intelligent, liberal, and uncorrupt ; 

As a son, a husband, and a brother, 

II is duty, gratitude, love and kindness 
could not be exceeded. 

His sprightliness and affability, 
the ease, urbanity, and cheerfulness 
of his conversation, 
united with firmness of mind, 
with a vigorous and cultivated understanding, 
un warped by prejudice, and undisturbed by passion, 
endeared him to society. 

These excellencies were high toned 
by the principles of Eeligion 
at once manly, rational and sincere. 

A few friends 
who deeply regret his loss 
testify their affection 
and soothe their sorrow 
by this memorial 
of his virtues.

Of the Rotherhams of Dronfield, a family connected with the 
Hey woods, by the marriage of Eliezer Hey wood the Elder 
with Ellen daur. of John Rotherham. 

There was an antient family who bore this surname, settled 
at Luton in the county of Bedford, in the time of Edward IV. 
John Rotherham had this estate which had been forfeited by 
the Lords Wenlock in the contests between the houses of 
York and Lancaster, by gift of his near kinsman Thomas 
Scott als Rotherham, Archbishop of York and Lord Chancellor 
of England. The Kotherhams of Dronfield and the arms 
borne by this antient family, viz : vert 3 barbs trippant argent, 
attired or, but their connection is not known. All that with 
certainty is known of the origin of the Dronfield family is that 
John and Ellen Rotherham, the first in the following pedi- 
gree, spent their long lives at that place. It is conjectured 
that this John Rotherham was the John Blythe alias Rotherham 
whose baptism is thus registered in the old register of the parish 
of Norton : 

“ 1610, July 1, bap. Joannes Blythe alias Rotherham, filius 
Joannis Blythe alias Rotherham de Norton yeoman, ex Alicia 
Bullock uxore ejus.” 

Mrs. Elizabeth Rotherham the last of the family left the 
Manor and other property to Mr. Joseph Cecil formerly of 
{Sheffield, who was not at all related to her. He lives at the 
old house of the Rotherhams, and has lately revived the market 
at the town of Dronfield. It will be seen from the pedigree, 
that on her death, the Hey woods became heirs to the blood of 
the Rotherhams and hence might quarter their arms, w T ere it 
proved that the Dronfield family had any right to bear them. 

There is an atchievment in Dronfield Church of the last 
Samuel Rotherham, Esq,, in which appears Rotherham, quarter- 
ing 1. Erminois on a pile Sab : a dexter gauntlet or, Hancock

Of the Shaws, a family connected with the Heywoods, by the 
marriage of Eliezer Hey wood of Mansfield with Jane daughter 
of Samuel Shaw. 



122 



Hunter’s Pedigrees . 



The Shaws as well as the Heywoods have been much dis- 
tinguished for their attachment to the cause of non-conformity. 
Dr. Calamy gives an account of 3 clergymen of this name who 
left considerable preferment on the passing of the act of uni- 
formity : namely Mr. Shaw, of Worsborough, Mr. John Shaw, 
of Hull, and Mr. Samuel Shaw. The last of these was the 
direct ancestor of the family of whom some short account is 
here to be given. The account will indeed be short, and very 
imperfect ; but any connection of the family might easily im- 
prove it, and probably render it complete at least as to the 
descendants of the ejected minister. 

The pleasant village of Eepton, once famous for its abbey, 
and since for its school where most of the Derbyshire gentry 
during the latter half of the last century had their education, 
was the birth-place of Mr. Samuel Shaw. Of his parents we 
have no other account but that they were pious, respectable 
people. He was boi:n in 1635, went from Repton school to 
St. John’s College, Cambridge, where he took a master’s degree. 
In 1656 he was Master of the Free School at Tamworth, lived 
a few months at Moseley near the borders of Worcestershire, 
and while there was ordained in the Presbyterian manner by 
the Classical Presbytery as it was called at Wirks worth in 
Derbyshire. In 1658 Cromwell presented him to the rectory 
of Long Whatton in Leicestershire, worth at that time £150 
per ann. This living he was forced to resign in 1661, a year 
before the passing of the Uniformity Act, so that he ought to 
have been spoken of above, as one who was silenced not de- 
prived by that oppressive measure of a tyrannical Administra- 
tion. From Long Whatton he removed to the village of Cotes 
near Loughborough, and while there lost two children of the 
plague which had Jbeen introduced into his family by some 
relation who fled from London at the time when that city was 
afflicted by that terrible visitation. Here he wrote his book 
called “ The welcome to the plague.” In 1666 he removed his 
residence to Ashby-de-la-Zouch, where, in 1668 he was ap- 
pointed master of the Free School. The school flourished ex- 
ceedingly under his care. When liberty to preach was allowed 
the Dissenters he licensed his school. Calamy gives him a 
high character, to which the reader is referred (Account, 
p. 426-436). He died on the 22nd of January, 1695-6. 
As an author he is best known by his “ Emanuel/’ commonly 



Hunter’s Pedigrees . 



123 



called “ Shaw’s Emanuel,” to distinguish it, I apprehend, from 
a work under the same title and published about the same 
time by Mr. Owen another non-conformist minister. Of his 
works however there is one, now exceedingly scarce, and which 
by most persons would be thought the most curious and valu- 
able among them. I shall give the title from Calamy, “ Words 
made visible, or Grammar and Rhetorick, a comedy.” “ The 
different humours of men, a comedy.” One should like to see 
a grave, formal non-conformist divine of that day sporting 
with the gayest of the muses. The discovery of this book 
in the list of his writings led me to look for his 1 name in a 
catalogue of men of a very different description from those of 
whom" Dr. Calamy has preserved so admirable an account — 
Langbaiiitt’s English dramatic writers — but without success. 
Indeed his comedies were only written for the diversion of the 
neighbourhood during Christmas, and performed by his own 
scholar^. May not this be among the first instances of such a 
custom, at least in country schools ? I have not been able to 
ascertain who was the wife of Mr. Shaw. It is probable she 
was a Crosse, Mr. William Crosse, of Derby, who was also a 
suffering non-conformist, being spoken of as Mr. Shaw’s 
brother-in-law. 

Nor have I been able to discover what family he left behind 
him, except that Mr. Ferdinando Shaw, of Derby, was his son. 
He was a minister among the nonconformists, and while a 
young man succeeded Mr. Crosse at Derby in 1698. Here he 
continued many years, exercising his ministry to a very ad- 
vanced age. In a volume of funeral-sermons which I lately 
bought out of a bookseller’s catalogue at Exeter, but which it 
appears once belonged to Mr. Eliezer Heywood, of Dronfield, 
is one entitled “ The Christian course finished with joy — a 
funeral-sermon preached at Derby, Oct. 14, 1740, at the inter- 
ment of Mrs. Elizabeth Shaw, wife of the Rev. Ferdinando 
Shaw, M.A., published at his request, by Jos. Rogerson. To 
which is added a Tribute of Gratitude to the memory of the 
deceased, by her mournful relict F. S., Derby, 1740.” This 
lady was allied to most of the best families in the county of 
Derby, for she was the daughter of William Eyre of Holm-hall, 
near Bakcwell, Esq., by Catherine his wife, daughter of Sir 
John Cell, of Hopton, Baronet. Of his descent and alliances 
I could give a very full account^ but as she had no issue by 



124 



Hunter' 8 Pedigrees. 



Mr. Shaw it seems to be unnecessary. They were married on 
the 4th Aug., 1708, and she died on the 11th Oct., 1740. The 
tribute to her memory by Mr. Shaw, is, as might be expected 
from a husband deeply sensible to the loss of an excellent 
wife. 

I have often heard that Mr. Shaw of Mansfield was the son 
of this Mr. Ferdinando Shaw. If so, then it must have been by 
some former wife, for though a particular account of the con- 
duct of Mrs. Elizabeth Shaw in every relation of life, is given 
in the sermon and tribute above-mentioned, nothing is said of 
her maternal character. Mr. Samuel Shaw was settled for a 
short time at Dronfield, and from thence removed to Mansfield, 
where he exercised his ministry many years, and when he died 
he left two sons both of whom married and left issue : also 
their daughters Mrs. Heywood, Mrs. Deyton. and Mrs. 
Broadhurst. 

Of the Hfywoods of Wakefield, Liverpool, Southampton, 
London, &amp;c., descended from Nathaniel Heywood the ejected 
rector of Ormskirk, who was son to Richard and Alice Hey- 
wood of Little-Lever and younger brother to Oliver Heywood. 

The reader who wishes for information on the life and 
character of Nathaniel Heywood may consult Dr. Calamy’s 
account of the ejected and silenced ministers. A few other 
particulars may be gained from the short memoir of him given 
by Mr. Watson in his history of Halifax. The account of his 
family which follows is compiled from communications made 
to my late friend John Milnes, Esq., by several of the existing 
members of it.

connect with my Pedigrees, at the same time there is little or 
no doubt but that the Pedigrees of both the Heywoods of Hey- 
wood in Lancashire and the Shaws of a Place near Sheffield are 
branches from the same common Ancester at no great remove 
from the time of the General Visitation in the beginning of Chs. 
the 2nd’s. reign, as I gather from the recurrence of the same 
Christian Names &amp; from other circumstances. The Conjecture 
of my Great Grand-Father Oliver that he was sprung from a 
Younger Brother of the House of Heywood of Heywood be- 
tween Rochdale &amp; Bury as Old Mr. Robt. Heywood of that 
place used to call his (Oliver’s) Father Cousin, is a strong cir- 
cumstance, when added to the Vicinity of their Situation the 
Marriage of one of the Family with a Lomax of Little Leaver 
&amp;c. &amp;c. I therefore think it highly probable that the first of 
the Family recorded in the Herald’s Office viz. Piers Haywoode 
or as it is in some other of the Books Heywood of Heywood in 
Derby Hundred Lancashire was the Elder Brot. of the Family 
of John Heywood of Heywood Mill Waterside in Bolton 
Parish. This Piers Heywood had a Son Peter who married a 
Gartside &amp; died about the year 1000 as the Herald’s Book 
records. This Peter had a Son Robt. who died in 1645 and 
was doubtless the Person alluded to by Oliver as calling Richd. 
Heywood his Cousin, &amp; It is observable that Oliver calls him 
Old Mr. Robt. Heywood to distinguish him from his Son Robt. 
who was living at the time Oliver wrote his Account of his 
Family. This Robt. the Son of Old Robt. in 1664 registered 
with the Herald the x^ccount of his Family as it there stands 
noticing he had a Son Peter then 3 Years Old. From this 
Peter Mr. Heywood of Whitehaven in 1784 traces a regular 
Pedigree, and has registered his own numerous Offspring, viz. 
6 childn. See his Pedigree S. H.*

POEM. * 

When Shall my dung-hill body give release 
unto my sad imprison’d soule that .lyes 
thus cag’d in darkries ? when shall I haw ease 
* , from all my sorrows and iniquitys ? 

tVhen shall I cease to sin, begin to praise, 
leave my complaints with this unhappy world, 
when shall I see my blest redeemer’s face ? 
whose heart-re joycing words haue me extold : 

Sometimes methinkes I feel but the first-fruits 
of Cannan’s fruitfull heart-re joycing land, 
which with such pleasing sweetnes me recruits 
as makes my fainting heart admiring stand : 

Lord, think I then, when shall my soule injoy 
that happy state of which I haue a glance 
when will my God this house of clay destroy, 
that to thy glory my soule might advance ? 

How long shall this my dead, sad, carnall heart 
within my pained, pining bosom lye. 

How long shall satan catch me with his art 
and lead me captive with proud victory ? 

When shall my heaven-born-soul mount up and sing 
amongst those naked sonles the angels dittys ? 
whose heart-delighting tune make heavens ring 
with Hallelujahs in th’ imperiall city : 

Ah, woe is me who sojourn like a stranger 
in these rude tents of Meshech here below ! 
must Kedar keep my soul in dolefull danger 
to be massacred by each deadly foe ? 

Ah wofull time of banishment from home ! 
must I an exile liue from my dear father ? 

Oh Absalom my case is now become 
as thine : my God and I must be togather ! 

Oh with what breathings doth my soule aspire 
like low Zacheus in a lofty tree ! 
so by thine ordinances I desire 
to see thee, tast thee, and to be with thee :

Sometimes I hear a heart-reviving word

Lord it is good to be here then I cry 
thus wonld I Hue, here let me dwel for aye 
mistaking earth for heaven and my joy 
which is at home for comforts in my way : 

But then alas my soul doth sadly feel

thus shall I end my days !

LOVE LETTER.* 

Endeared Sweetheart, 

For such a privileged Title, God’s good 
Providence, Friends’ Consent, and my mutual Love admits of. 
When I was last with you there fell into my Bosom such a 
spark of Love that nothing will quench it but Yourself. The 
Nature of this Love, is, I hope sincere, the measure of it great, 
and as far as I know my own Heart it is right and genuine. 
The very bare probability of success ravished my Heart with 
Joy, and made me rest those Words of Elizabeth upon the 
Sight of Mary, that these Things are too good to prove true. 
But since the Finger of God hath carried it on in a slow pace, 
through dark and dubious Interruptions, and hath set this

Love Letter by Oliver Heywood . 

Matter in a full and legal Light ; my Heart was much affected 
with it, chiefly for the regard I have for a praying Family, 
whose Tears in God’s Bottle, and Prayers in God’s 
Book are the best inheritance in the World, to a surviving 
Posterity. I have already found the advantage of it, which I 
would not change for all the Gold in the Indies ; and I hope 
the Lord has given You in part your father’s Spirit, and has 
made You all glorious within, he has beautified your Body, 
very pleasant are You to me. You are in my Heart to live 
and die in waiting on You ; and I extremely please Myself in 
loving You, and I like my Affections the better because they 
tell me they are only placed upon You ; but here I stop lest 
I be suspected of flattery ; it is indeed contrary to my natural 
Inclination, but more to my grave calling, as I am a Minister 
of the Gospel, to speak beyond the Truth : I rather beg Pardon 
for my purposed Plainness, but sweet Mrs. Betty as I have 
given my Heart to You, You ought in return to give me 
Yours, and You cannot in Equity deny it me. I have been 
very urgent at the Throne of Grace, and that which is won by 
Prayer, may be worn with praise ; but I fear now I shall tire 
your Patience, and beg leave to conclude, who am by a thous- 
and Links and Chains of pure affections 

Your devoted servant till death

Since the god of the spirits of al flesh hath [num 16 22 
breathed into me the breath of life and made me [gen 2 7 
a living soul, since he hath put into my soul [1 cor 2 11 
that godlike reflecting faculty of conscience, 
since also he hath so frequently called upon me [ps 4 4

to be called a Christian much lesse a minister, [1 cor 15 9 10 
&amp; tho I be nothing, can doe nothing, defend 
nothing, yet I hope I may say, by the grace of god I am what 
I am : &amp; I dare not deny or bely the lord and say it is not he 
that hath been at worke in my hart, tho I be 
sinful dust and ashes, a worme &amp; no man, more [ps 22 6 
bruitish then any man, yet god forbid I should [pro 30 2 
deforme any fruit of grace that hane appeared 
in &amp; to my poore soul, as I dare nos beare false [exod 20 16 
witnes agt my selfe, so if I doe alone bear witnes 
of my selfe without the concurrent testimony of [job 5 31 
the word &amp; spirit of god my witnes is not true 
as my dear saviour said in another case : therfore in my 
searchings of my self I desire to keep aloofe from that soul- 
undoing systems of merit, either of condignity or congruity, 
also what is sorry man to procure by right improving nature 
or grace any good from god either first or second grace. I 
dare not ascend to heaven on Acesine laddar, but by jacobs 
onely. I dare not build my hopes of heaven on so sandy a 
foundation as mine owne righteousness, nay I cannot lean upon 
the fruite &amp; grace of the spirit in me in point 
of justification, it is onely the lord our righteous- [jer 23 6

this life &amp; that wch is to come, upon my com- 
paring my state with the rule of the word I haue by the help 
of divine grace found out these several fruits of the 
gal 5 21] spirit, and characters of a saint, which are not 
the fruits of reading or meditation but the language 
of my hart : 

1 I haue long agoe when I was a child found 
act 9 6] the lord awakening my conscience, &amp; shaking the 
16 29 foundations of my soul with strange &amp; strong con- 
fusions, convictions, &amp; convulsions, wherby my 
woeful doleful &amp; undone estate by nature was dis- 
eph 2 12] covered. I saw my selfe graceles, Christies, &amp; 
therby hopeles &amp; helples. I had thoght I had had 
some good in me, an ingenious &amp; religious education, had 
restrained the exorbitancy of my hart, &amp; constrained me to 
a conformity of life, &amp; I slided insensibly into civil &amp; spiritual 
formalitys wch made me whole &amp; ful in mine owne 
Rom 7 7] conceit, but the spiritual nature of the loue of god 
8 9 10 11 shewed me that the least evil thought was a breach 
of the law, many a time haue I sadly reflected 
upon my breaking every command of god, and therlore I saw 
the law shut me up under wrath, &amp; gods curse wherby I saw 
my selfe as a condemned malefactor leading towards execution, 
this made me cry out woe is me I am undone, I am a damned 
wretch, an enemy to god, I can doe nothing thats truely good, 
inclined to al sin the black brand of reprobation 
Rom 8 15] is upon me, &amp; tho these dreadful thoghts were 
most violent at first yet I had many returnes oi

mine owne bottomes : 

2 the lord opened to me a cloud of hope, [hos 2 14 15 
even that vally of achor.christs sore soul- travel [zach 9 10 11 
which did a little stay &amp; bear up my heart [isai 55 5 
from sinking discouragement, indeed of a good 6 &amp;c 
while I could not imagine there was any mercy 

for such a vile wretch, and thought my sins were such as the 
lord would not pardon yet when I read &amp; con- 
sidered the fulnes and freenes of gospel-promises, [isai 55 1 
&amp; universality of the tendernes of cht, that cht [1 tim 1 15 
makes no exception of particular persons or sins, 
and that christ came into the world to saue sinners &amp; I was a 
sinner. I durst not totally cast it off, &amp; yet I durst not apply 
that redemption, lest I should presume and take what did not 
belong to me, I thought it too good news to be true that christ 
should offer himselfe to me the chiefest of sinners, in the mean 
time the lord let mee see that nothing else in the 
world would doe my soul that good I wanted but [act 4 12 
cht, onely christ. I could not indure to think of 
any thing else, the world, was a lumpe of vanity, feed 1 2 
unfavouring struggle I cared not for it, every thing [gal 6 14 
was emptines and vacuity, the profits, pleasures, &amp; 
honours of the world were but guilded nultitys &amp; I wondred 
how any could be so enamoured &amp; transported with the fading 
beauty therof — 

3 It broke my hart to think there was any hope for such a 
vile creature as I was, I much wondred at gods 

infinit patience &amp; longsuffering that I was kept [2 pet 3 9 15 
out of hel, that god had not given me my por- 
tion with reprobates and unbeleevers even for the sins of my 
nature wch I brought into the world, wch haue been many a 
time matter of hart-breaking complaints, that 
I should be conceived &amp; brought forth in [psal 51 5 
sin, &amp; lye wallowing in my blood no eye

brim-ful of evil. But that wch dissolved 
my hart into penitential teares was my actual [1 thes 5 19

frequent cals of christ, &amp; tenders of loue, &amp; 
yet his stretching forth his hand even al the 
day long ; ah thought I that god should yet 
take notice of so vile a creature, and follow me with redoubled 
importunitys as tho he resolved to haue no nay, but to doe me 
good in my latter end : o what impression it hath taken upon 
my hart that god should leaue the fathers bosome, liue so 
poorely, dye so miserably, for such hard- 
harted, rebellious, &amp; grace-resisting sinners 
and that I should haue a hand in crucifying 
him, and yet he offer his blood &amp; selfe to me. 
tho I set so lightly this kindnes, yet that he 
should not let me alone, but again &amp; agen say 
to me turne thee turne thee, why wilt thou dye ? oh I could 
not tel what to say to the kindnes of cht : 

4 After the lord jesus had been standing at the 
cant 5 4 5] doore of my hart &amp; knocking, at last he put his 
finger in at the hole of the doore, and by his 
spirit removed the great barre of my unwillingnes &amp; unbeleefe, 
and he sweetly moved my hart to close with him ; I did not 
know indeed whether I was fit to come to cht, nay I was per- 
suaded my hart was not sufficiently humbled, but 
1 job 3 23] I durst not but obey that gospel-command of 
beleeviug in the son of god : I knew there was 
no other course to be taken but venturing my soul on cht, and 
so in obedience to god I cast downe my soul at the feet of fre*a- 
grace, and ventured my selfe upon him, with this 
resolution, if I perish 1 perish, who knows but he 
may haue mercy upon me, the blood of christ is 
of infinite value, sufficiency, &amp; efficiency, the 
promise is universal, god is not limited, he hath 
saved great sinners &amp; why not me ? the king of 
job 6 37] Israel is merciful he never cast off those thar, 
come to him, nay he chides some because they 
come not to him. I had indeed kept of by reason of unwo v - 
thines, but I was convinced that might be pride because l 
thought I would bring a present to cht to render me acceptable, 
yet at last the lord helped me agt that temptation, &amp; I resolved 
I would not be kept off from my dear saviour any longer — 

5 I considered al my sins in hart &amp; life, and it w'as the very

for his high attainments in grace &amp; service to his 
god, whose praise is in al the churches, tho I haue [2 cor 8 18 
no other acquaintance with him then by hearsay 
&amp; reading his books : 

10 I haue exceedingly longed after &amp; delighted in commu- 
nion of saints and loved the image of god in his 
people. I desire to prize them as the onely excel- [psal 16 3 
lent on earth, and be an inseparable companion to [ps 119 63 
them. I more prize a poore, ragged, despised 
Christian in whom appeares any thing of christ then the most 
gaudy &amp; glorious gallants in best attire &amp; largest 
attendants ; in my eyes a rich &amp; revelling gentle- [psal 15 4 
man is but a vile person compared with a poore 
praying saint. Such in scripture are called by the names of 
bruit creatures, &amp; the most despicable things, as 
wash-pot, vessels of dishonour — &amp; therfore I [psal 
would rather pity then envy such as are not rich [Rom 9 21 
towards god, whose portion is here below ; but [ps 17 14 
methinks also a sincere Christian is the fairest peece 
of the creation, whose inward graces are much set [1 pet 3 4 
by, and whose lines are precious in the eyes of [ps 116 15 
god, and since the angels themselues are not too [heb 1 14 
good to be their ministring spirits, I think I 
could performe the meanest offices of loue to the meanest of 
them, it hath much broken my hart to think that 
our dear saviour washt &amp; wipt his disciples feet, [joh 13 5 
and who am I to be admitted to so high an office 
as my dear master, surely its rather an advancement then abase- 
ment, yea he hath abated our aspiring thoughts with injoyning 
such as would be greatest to be servant to the rest : I would 

always be in the company of them that fear god that I might 
get some good to my soul by soul-raising, grace-excercising, 
hart-quickening dutys &amp; discourses, and a day in such company 
is better then a thousand in the tents of wickednes, I desire to 
embrace al opportunitys in publick ordinances, &amp; private 
excercises for the furthering of my poore soul in the way to 
heaven : nor would I limit my loue or complacency to those 
who are of the same judgment with my selfe, or who for other 
carnal ends may seem to attract it, but those that are of other 
judgments, &amp; opinions in lesser points, &amp; circumstantial 
things, yea tho in greater if I can see their soules are within

the covenant of grace, &amp; I lone them purely for their relation 
to cht, tho never like to advantage nor for outward man, nay 
tho crossing me &amp; covered with many corruptions &amp; infirmities, 
when the lord helps me to recollect my selfe &amp; turne unto a 
sober &amp; deliberate frame of spirit : 

11 My principal desire and design in the dutys of gods 
worship is to converse with god — to haue a hart suitable ther- 
unto, &amp; warmed therwith and sometimes I can find my hart 
wonderfully wrought upon, and excercised in deep expression 
of godly sorrow for my sin, in strong breathings and pantings 
after god for suitable supplvs, in raised ravishing admiration 
of his goodnes, and free grace to such a vile wretch and the 
lord comes in sometimes with the gales of his grace, refreshing 
my hart, sealing his loue to my loule, &amp; testifying his accept- 
ance of me and audience of my prayers : yea I haue sometimes 
found visible returnes of prayer, and when I feel such inter- 
course with god, tis the rejoycing of my hart, and the best 
feast my soul can tast of, then doth he bring me into his wine- 
cellar, and there doth he giue me his loues, then doth he help 
me to renew my covenant by such sacrifices. And there would 
I spend my life, &amp; am loath to withdraw therfrom, but alas it is 
but seldom thus with me, many times I come to an ordinance in 
publick, and dutys in private &amp; secret, but haue a cold, dead, 
formal, and distracted hart, I can neither mind the work nor 
excercise grace, I feel little of the quickening presence of god, 
but yet I am not satisfyed at such a time, its my great trouble 
when god doth hide himself, and tho I be dul &amp; out of frame 
yet methinks I am not right, theres some hungring &amp; hanker- 
ing after his gracious presence, tho not such vigorous and 
violent pantings and endeavours as I could desire : my spirit is 
off the hinges, and like pharoahs chariot wheels I drive on 
heavily, and therfore could desire the oyle of gods grace might 
soften my heart, &amp; facilitate my progress in his ways, that the 
joy of the lord might be my strength. 

12 I desire for ever to be purely nothing in mine owne eyes, 
that joyne cht may be al in all, I am ignorance itselfe, but he 
is the wisdome of god : weaknes and he is strength, and I desire 
his wisdome &amp; strength might be made perfect in my folly &amp; 
infirmity. When I doe any thing that is good tis he that doth 
it by me &amp; in me : for without him I can doe nothing, and 
when I haue done al I can I am an unprofitable servant. I

would take hold of his strength in every work &amp; duty, and 
desire for ever to acknowledg his grace &amp; assistance in al he 
hath inabled me to doe, to attribute al to his free-grace, &amp; 
arrogate nothing to my selfe, if, he shame me, staine my pride, 
&amp; cast contempt on me in any performance, so he humble &amp; 
unbolt to me this proud hart, get glory to his name, &amp; credit to 
his ways I hope I can blesse him for it, and look upon it as a 
gracious providence so my soul receiue advantage, and if at any 
time he inlarge my hart in any good worke, especially before 
others, I am jeolous of my base deceitful hart lest through a 
pang of pride &amp; vainglory I should ascribe something to my 
selfe, and seem to part take with that god who is a jeolous 
god and hath said he wil not giue his glory to another : I find 
by woeful experience I am exposed unto greater snares and 
temptations when I haue been inlarged then wn I haue been 
straitned, even my dutys are occasions of my saddest falts ; 
either for my resting or my glorying therin : 

13 I desire to owne god in &amp; blesse god for those outward 
comforts I in joy who am less than the least of all his mercy s, 
these are sweet and precious for my comfort in this vale of 
tears. I desire to admire his undeserved loue &amp; favour to me, 
my relations, &amp; injoyments and great mercvs, considering my 
frequent forfitures, and fearful ingratitude — but yet I would 
not for a world be put off with these, but would rather be 
without those outward comforts, then covenant-mercys, yea I 
would far rather want those then not haue them in loue, &amp; 
with a blessing. I have been often jeolous lest my hart be 
stollen away therwith, and sometimes been afraid of being rich, 
lest I should set my hart upon such moveable &amp; winged trifles, 
I would willingly honour the lord with my substance, and 
desire to embrace joyfully any opportunitys of doing good, 
and would lay out my poor talent in what way my god shal 
cal for and command it from me, I care not what I giue or 
spend in the cause of god, and good of soules, and hope I shal 
be freely content with what condition the lord shal put this 
poor worm into, whether in poverty or prosperity, good report 
or bad report, joy or sorrow, so he wil cary me on safely and 
contentedly to glory, for godlines with contentment is great 
gaine. it is best for me and mine to be at gods disposal, and 
I am willing to resign up my selfe to his wil, wch is the best 
for me, and haue my stubborn wil melted into his, and to

trust him over al, and giue up al my comforts and relations 
into his hands, who is a faithful and merciful creatour. I 
desire to look upon them al as but lent me for a time, and 
would giue them up again unto the lord, as my duty and his 
due, to sit loose therefrom, using not abusing them, imploying 
them for his use, not injoying them as my ultimate end, for 
whom have I in heaven but god, and I have nothing worth the 
name of good on earth but what hath some tendency to com- 
munion with him : 

14 It is my dayly care and endeavor to mortify and crucify 
the lusts of the flesh, to bring under every thought to the obe- 
dience of christ, to avoid occasions and appearances of evil, to 
cut off and cast away sins as near and dear as my right hand 
or right eye, especially to set my selfe right against the sin of 
my nature, calling or constitution that doth so easily beset me, 
and frequently overtake me : I would level my spiritual com- 

bats universally agt al sin, and spare no agag or achan, but hate 
every false way, yet I would lay the strongest batterys against 
my owne corruptions my darling and dalilah lusts, and con- 
paratiuely fight neither agt such a great so much as these, I 
know one sin liued in and allowed wil damn my soul as wel as 
a thousand, and over. I could shew the greatest antipathy agt, 
and get the most prevalency, over original lusts, natural concu- 
piscence, this is the spring, head, and root of al my corruptions, 
I would so far as I know mine owne hart see that wasted and 
weakened, by al good ways and means, fasting, prayer, watching 
over my hart, avoiding occasions, and al those peeces of the 
spiritual armour, and fetch supply out of that panoply, but 
aboue al to deriue continual vertue from jesus christ, by faith, 
I would dayly make use of his purging, washing, sanctifying 
blood, and desire that he would be to me as a refiners fire and 
as fullers sope, nay tho he should take away my filth and drosse 
by the spirit of judgment and the spirit of burning, tho he 
should put me into the furnace of affliction yet I should blesse 
him if thereby I may be purifyed and made white, I know 
their vertue enough in christ to dry up the bloody issue of sin, 
and tho stil it remaines in me, yet I hope it reignes not, and 
tho it be in me as a prick in my sides to vex me as a tyrant, 
yet not to haue dominion over me as a lawful soveraigne, tho I 
am as paul sold under sin, yet I hope not as Ahab, sold my selfe 
to worke wickednes, tho I commit sin yet I doe not make sin

my worke, constant trade and practice, the law of the spirit of 
life in christ jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and 
death, I haue enough in me to humble me yet not to condemne 
me, because thers no condemnation to ym that are in cht, as I 
hope I am : and I beleeue I shal come off the field as a con- 
querour at last through jesus christ the captain of my salvation, 
the lion of the tribe of judah : 

15 As the lord helps me to maintain a combate with sin, 
so that tho it doe sometimes prevail yet it is not ordinarily 
with the ful consent of my wil, and bent of my hart, but that 
I make some resistance thro grace : so it doth not ordinarily 
keep me downe, but the lord raiseth me up agen after my 
falls and faults and breaketh my hart under the sense therof. 
Methinks I cannot rest til the guilt of sin be removed off my 
conscience by the renewed exercise of repentance, and actual 
application of the blood of christ : it melts my heart most to 
think of the dishonour of god by sin, and grieving his good 
spirit, then any outward loss or maintenance, yea I hope more 
than any shame here or pain of hel hereafter : oh my soul 
breathes after an establishment by the free and royal spirit — 
the setting of my broken love and sealing up my soul by the 
holy spirit to the day of redemption. I have thought some- 
times if god did not shine upon my heart with comforts, or 
restore to me the joy of his salvation yet if he would repair 
the dishonour his name hath suffered by my sin, and set me 
upon sure ground, it would much content me : nay such hath 
been his covenant keeping-love that he hath caused my very 
sins also to work together for my good, how many times hath 
he mingled a medicinal potion for my soul out of that bitter 
and biting poyson, to humble me, take me off my ballances, 
made me trust my selfe lesse, depend more on god watch more 
narrowly over my hart. Just and righteous are thy ways o 
king of saints, how unsearchable are [h]is judgments and ways 
past finding out — 

1G I haue desired to be a mourner in zion, and to grieue for 
the abominations of the laud and place where I Hue. My soul 
hath sometimes wept in secret for the pride and prophanes of 
wicked men, principally because of gods dishonour, and the 
destruction of poore soules, the miscariages of professours haue 
been no smal trouble to me, because therby occasion hath been 
given to wicked men to blaspheme god and reproach religion ;

I desire freely to forgiue and forget the injnrys offered me by 
the wicked, and hartily pray for their conversion and salvation. 
The concernmts of the church and interest of christ hath lyen 
near my hart, I hane been more afraid lest the glory of the 
land (and the gospel of christ) depart from England" then my 
private damage ; I desire to pray more for the peace of Jerusa- 
lem and prosperity of zion then any worldly advantage, and 
lone the cause of christ more then any party ; it hath sadly 
afflicted me to see god withdraw the power of his converting 
and quickening grace from his advances, and take this partial 
desertion as a sad prognostick of his total departure, wch the 
lord in mercy prevent ; my soul longs to see an universal re- 
pentance, and reformation of the land and nation, that wrath 
and judgmts may rather be timely prevented then justly in- 
flicted, and 1 resolue by the grace of god within the compasse 
of my place and calling to prevent the spreading of wickednes, 
and promote holines, and the power of godlines, wch I am in- 
gaged to tho I never took the national covenant. I desire to 
bring to shame and punishment grosse offenders, and to speak 
to them in publick and private, to warn them from their evil 
ways, and pray that god would giue a blessing therunto — 

17 I desire to discharge my relatiue dutjs faithfully and 
conscientiously, as a child I haue humbly desired the lord to 
help me to be dutiful and obedient to honour and lone parents 
as instruments of my corporal and spiritual good, to requite 
their care and cost in what I am able, and think I can never 
doe enough for them, it hath been the griefe of my soul to 
grieue my godly parents, or to see them grieved with any of 
their children ; and now I am a father, I desire to dedicate my 
children to god, and to train them up for god. I am sensible 
I haue begot them in mine owne image, in a corrupt 
state, and see they wil be undone without regeneration, 
therfore my soul breaths after the repairing of gods image 
in them, and gods embracing of them in a covenant way, 
and making use of them for his glory, rather then to know 
they should be princes. I am apt to over-loue them, but 
their inward deformity by the fal checks my too much dealing 
on their due proportion and desirable beauty : as a husband 
my hart is endeared to my loving wife for that glory within, 
and that unfeigned faith that illustriously shined in her famous 
progenitors, and I doe beleeue is in her also, my hart is more

ravished with her inward qualitys then outward excellencys, 
tho rarely accomplished in both, I am often jeolous lest my 
conjugal loue should degenerate into or be mixed too much 
with carnal and sensual delight, and beg often it may be 
spiritualized and my desire is to cary lovingly and faithfully 
towards her, as a man of knowledge resolving doubts, quicken- 
ing grace, assisting agt temptations, that we may be mutually 
helpful in the things of god, as heires togather of the grace of 
life : and as a master I desire to behaue my selfe meekly, 
humbly, condescendingly to my servants, as my equals in 
Christianity, to giue them that wch is equal and honest ; to 
forbear threatening, to haue them as those in whom I beleeue 
the image of christ is repaired, to giue them liberty for their 
soules advantage in publick and private and incite them ther- 
unto, and my serious prayer and care is they may serue god in 
serving me, yea rather then me ; it is no sual joy to me to haue 
in my family the covenanted children of covenanted parents, 
and I desire to be their servant in spirituals, to be helpers of 
their joy, to answer their doubts, incourage their harts, and 
further them in the way to heaven, I desire that I and my 
house may serue god, and would haue none come under my 
charge but such as haue submitted to the yoke of cht, and that 
walke in the same way to heaven that I desire to sojourne in : 
18 It often troubles me that I begun no sooner in the prac- 
tice of religion, because I sinned so long against so good a 
god, and grieved his holy spirit, and dishonoured his name, o 
what a losse and misse had I that I was so long before I was 
acquainted with the comforts of grace and holines, I see grace- 
les persons are strangers to tame pleasures, and o what a misery 
is it that I haue made no more progresse and proficiency in 
the ways of god, that I am yet a novice in religion, that I 
make no more hast after god, that I haue improved oppertu- 
nitvs no better, it costs me many a sad houre and salt tear that 
I haue such sittings loose and backslidings from god, such a 
carnal, dead, secure, unbeleeving hart, that yet my state is so 
darke, and grace so weak and corruptions so strong, that after 
so long a profession I should be sometimes at such uncear- 
taincys and at so great a losse, that god hath so little glory by 
me, that I am of so little use in my place, and sometimes fear-

might never sin more, walk close and evenly with my god, and 
grow up into cht in al things suitably and sensibly, and haue 
my conversation in heaven, this would be a little heaven on 
earth, and the proeludium of eternal happines :

second coming of christ to judge the quick and dead, o thats 
a blessed time, such times of refreshing as shal come from the 
presence of the lord, when he wil descend with a mighty shout, 
and with a word shall raise the dead, and gather al his sts 
togather, from the foure winds, and giue them the white stone 
of perfect absolution, and say come ye blessed when he shal be 
admired in al them that beleeue, and they shal be admitted 
with triumphant praises into eternal mansions, that where the 
head is there the members may be also. I desire to comfort 
my hart wth forethoughts of the glorious appearing of the 
blessed god, and waiting for his son from heaven, and hope I 
shal not be afraid and hide my selfe as wicked crying to the 
rocks and mountains, but to lift up my head, when I see the 
signes of the son of man appearing, and his returne approach-

wil be my surety, advocate, and my redeeming-kinsman. I 
desire to think with joy of the accomplishing of the prophecys

coming, conversion of jews, spreading of the gospel through

and he knoweth who are his, and they that trust in the lord 
shal be as mount zion that shal never be removed. My weake 
and wavering hope is that as christ is now precious in my eyes* 
so I shal find favour in his sight and that he wil not cast off 
the soul of me poore trembling sinner : My soul longs to oe 
with christ wch is best of al, and I beleeue that when this 
earthly house of my tabernacle is dissolved, I haue a building 
not made with hands, but eternal in the heavens, and for this 
I groan earnestly for that rich and glorious cloathing : woe is 
me that I am forced to dwel in meshech and sojourne in this 
weary wildernes, when shal my soul be set at liberty out cd 
the mouldy cage, that al my sins may passe away, temptations 
may be removed, and my pressing burdens may never trouble 
me again, that al my teares may be wiped away, and al joy 
may be introduced, yt I may with the morning lark mount 
and sing, and may be cloathed with the garments of salvation* 
and remembre my sorrows as the waters that passe away, where 
my dead distracted unbeleeving hart shal never care, and satan 
shal never put up his head, and divisions shal not grieue my 
hart, o when will this vayle of my flesh be broken downe tlait 
I might in joy more perfect, immediate and perpetual cornu 
nion with my god, o come lord jesus come quickly : 

Wei were it with me if I had no more corruption then mea 
can take notice of, and woe were it to me if I had no mora 
religion then others know of : neither my goodnes nor nauj 
tines is obvious to the eyes either of good or bad : 

I haue been many times hurryed with this temptation, that 
surely men saw some misdemeanours in my cariage, wch begot 
opposition, at least my indiscretion procured their resistance, 
but its much taken off by observing that the piety of the 
present conformist at Coley hath bred him some disturbance 
from the spirits of mine adversarys : 

too things doe exceedingly humble me in the abundance of 
my inlargements, and the credit god hath given me amon&lt;?s£ 
his people, viz, my corruptions that are so apt to break out and 
keep me under, and my stupidity and inability to conceiue of 
the abstruse peeces of learning, or knotty controversys wherm 
I see others so far excell me, wherin I never yet could attain 
to any dextority, wch doth much abase me in mine owne eyes : 
especially when I hear others discourse so nicely upon 
subjects, and myselfe can speak so little to purpose :

Autobiography 

A Relation of the most considerable passages of my life from 
my infancy hitherto, wch I doe upon these accounts, 

1 to lay open more carefully and convincingly my posture 
and gestures that what I doe amisse may lye upon me as a 
burden, and guilt may not be charged upon me, and goe along 
with me to the graue, yea that my bones may not 

be ful of the sins of my youth, nor yet be accused [job 20 11 
by satan, or accursed by god in old age, or judg- [isai 65 20 
ment having obtained a pardon of them in the 
blood of christ, before my departure hence : 

2 to inferre a good caution from the by-past for the remain- 
ing part of my life, that where I haue seen danger of a ship- 
wreck I may obserue such rocks, and quicksands and charge 
mine owne hart with more jeolousy and watchfulnes, and make 
a covenant with my senses, members, facultys, and know satans 
devices, and where my strength and weaknes lyes : o what a 
helpful improuement may former experiences proue to future 
closewalking : 

3 to review by-past providences as a motiue to thankfulnes, 
that wherever I haue discovered any special appearances of 
god upon my hart or in my life, by preventing or priviledging 
mercys, I may owne and honour god therin, and for them, I 
would not be the graue of enjoyments but would ingage my 
life to fruitfulnes and desire god would inlarge my hart in 
suitable thankfulnes, my mercys ought to be a spurre to more 
faithful duty : 

4 to compare my past and present state and obserue my 
proficiency in Christianity, to see whether I be better this year 
then the last, whether grace be stronger, corruptions weaker, 
my hart more soft, conscience more tender, wil more bowed, 
rectifyed, resolved, and my life more reformed, wch may as I 
find matters increase, godly sorrow, holy joy, jealousy, thank- 
fulnes, — oh what good might I get if thus god helps me to 
number my days and so put me upon applying my hart to 
wisedome — 

This poore miserable creature was born in little Leaver of 
gracious and religious parents, [Richard and Alice Hey wood] 
and w r as baptized at Bolton in Lancashire march 15 anno 
domini 1629, at wch time the bishops were in the height of 
their domineering government, and yet I was not signed 
with that ceremony of the crosse in baptisme : tho by

the help of god I shal not be ashamed of the [Rom 116 
gospel, yea I desire to glory in the crosse of cht ; [gal 6 3 4 
it rejoyceth me to review the great number of [isai 8 2 
faithful witnesses that ther was at my admission 
into infant church-membership, who prayed for me, and into 
whose number I was immediatly entertained, since the place 
hath been long famous for glorious professors of the gospel, and 
powerful preachers, 1 take it as one of the great mercys of my 
life that my nativity was in goshen under the 
starre of jacobs special influence, under the [numb 24 \1 
sanctifying showers of grace, nor doe I think 
that wch passed upon me in infancy was an empty ceremony or 
bare formality, but ful of efficacy already, for when the spirit 
begun to stirre in my hart baptisme begun to wake, and it hath 
abundantly satisfyed me at the celebrating of that ordinance 
of baptisme that I was partaker of the same, for substance— 
My father hath traded in the ways of god from his youth, 
being first wrought upon by that useful instrument by whom 
god did so much good to soules in those parts, Mr Hubbert at 
Cockey, if I mistake not, — my grandfather, [Oliver Heywood] 
was a man of singular and admirable attaimnents in religion, 
as I haue often heard, especially considering his time and stand- 
ing, being converted when he was ancient, at a sermon preached 
at a Bury faire by Mr Pagit, and afterwards followed and em- 
braced him as his spiritual father whiles he lived, as Mr Pa«u 
lately told me, this is the more observable because 
god called at the eleventh howre, and therin 
shewed his power and prerogatiue royal for an 
incouragement: al things are possible with god, 
who pluckt him as a brand out of the fire and 
changed his cethiopian hiew, after a threescore 
yeares course in carnality, vanity and formality, 
this resurrection of dry bones in his soul-affaires, 
might be a type of the restitution of our poore 
family already graciously accomplished; after his conversion 
he was much renowned for zeal, tendernes, meeknes, self — * 
denyal loue and humility, and increased to a considerable pitch 
in grace in his declining age, he used to spend much time m 
secret dutys, and when he hath been longer then ordinary and 
called upon about any necessary occasion he said you haue done 
me a worse turne then you are aware of in robbing me of my god- '

After him was I called and named by the women [luk 1 59 
that stood by at my birth, whose prayers to god 
were for a like disposition in me as in my worthy and godly 
ancestour I think imposing of names may be of singular use 
for our imitation of their vertues, I desire and hope their 
prayers may be answered that I may haue a double portion of 
his spirit, this would be a worthy portion, and far better to me 
then any other patrimony ; I more rejoyce in godly and 
gracious proedecessours then rich, potent, and honourable, and 
tho I am the least in my fathers house, and that 
the meanest in the land yet I know he sees not [1 sam 16 7 
as man sees, and nothing can obstruct the cause 
of free-grace, he takes an Abel, shem, Isaac, jacob, joseph, 
david Ephraim, &amp;c tho blessed be his name he hath not left 
the rest under black brand of rejection, but given good grounds 
of hope for the rest also 

But tho my parents were godly yet my birth 
and my nativity was in sin, and so was my con- [psal 51 5 
ception, for they were instruments to bring me 
into the world not as saints but as man and woman, 
not after gods but their owne image, not as [gen 5 3 
children of god by adoption, and regeneration, 
but of Adam by natural generation, in wch 
respect my father was an Amorite and mother an [ezek 16 3 
Hittite therby I am by nature a child of wrath, [eph 2 3 
a limb of satan, exposed to shame and mine 
despoiled of gods image, having satans superscription, and guilt 
with propensity to sin, and contrariety to good incorpurated 
in my pnmitiue constitution ; and that too too fruitful root 
begun to sprout in infancy, I cannot remember the time or 
age, state or place wherm I was free from sin or perpetrating 
therof, what peevishnes, untowardnes, stubbornes doe I see in 
mine wch is a glasse to represent my frame when of their ao*e. 
I remember how proud I was of any little coveted excellency, 
how fond I was of trifles, how backward to good excercises, 
how forward to sinful practices, how tractable to follow bad 
examples. I may say yt childhood and youth are vanity, yea 
and next akin to bruitish stupidity, and Atheistical blasphemy, 
we are borne and liue long even like the wild asses colt, the 
time was when with children in playing 1 vented my selfe in 
many barbarous ways, yea undoubted oathes, and when one of

my sisters found fault with me, I replyed I had not found so 
much as a neighbour child with whom I used to play, so foolish 
was I and ignorant even as a beast before god, and since our 
first parents aspired to be as gods we al became as beasts that 
perish, — when I was a child I spake as a child, yea rather like 
a devil incarnate, oh the desperate wickednes of my deceitful 
hart 

I haue observed from my childhood and youth my natural 
constitution exceedingly inclined to lust, which hath discovered 
itselfe betimes, and many times impetuously assoulted me both 
waking and sleeping, occasions, and temptations backt with 
strong sollicitations haue been so violent upon me, that I look 
upon it as a miraculous mercy, that god hath not left me to 
stain my profession, and be a perpetual blot to my selfe and 
friends by some notorious act of prodigious uncleanes, oh what 
experience haue I of preventing grace on that behalfe, and tho 
I haue prayed thrice yea many a time to be delivered from 
this thorne in the flesh and messenger of satan yet gods 
answer hath been a sufficiency of grace for remission, preven- 
tion and reconciliation. I see tis gods wisdome thus to excer- 
cise me, which hath many a time procured a sad hart, and 
many a salt teare, it is my griefe and I must bear it, nay tis 
very good that my faith and patience should thus be excercised, 
and spiritual combats thus maintained, and tho I may take 
much paines in mortifying dutys to crucify the flesh and beat 
downe my body, yet for ought I see I must cary it about me 
with sadnes to my graue. My individual constitution much 
leads me to that corruption, yet can I not altogether charge it 
upon that lest therby I should reflect upon my maker: god 
forbid that I should say to him that made me, why hast thou 
made me thus, there no cause to accuse the righteous judg of 
al the earth, for he doth not in framing our natures necessitate 
any to sin, my owne corrupt hart is the principal cause, it was 
an unadvised act in Origen to dismember himselfe, to avoid 
fornication, or the philosopher in putting out his eyes lest he 
should behold vanity god appoints other meanes to overcome 
sin. 

My prudent and provident parents much prevented the out- 
breakings of this body of sin and lopt off by seasonable dis- 
cipline, and renewed instructions the extravagant branches of 
exorbitant lusts, and I was generally kept by loue or awe in a

suitable conformity of visible civility and sanctity, so that, I 
blesse god evil practices tho now and then putting forth them- 
selues were not habituated in me through custome, wch might 
haue proved destructiue to my soul, and more difficult to con- 
quer ; tho I cannot now, nor ever could blesse myselfe as 
needing no repentance, 1 haue a corrupt nature, and treacher- 
ous hart, from wch unles I be changed by grace, I cannot 
expect salvation, — on wch behalfe tho some can make punctual 
and particular discoverys of the method, manner, time and 
meanes of their regeneration, yet for my owne part I cannot 
giue any such account of circumstances therabout, tho I am 
fully satisfyed the lord hath been at worke with my soul, by 
many stirrings of the spirit of bondage, both in childhood and 
afterwards, — many a time haue I got alone and been distressed, 
and then I haue fallen off agen to loosnes and carelesnes, but 
being awakened many a time after backslidings, I haue been 
so perplexed in spirit, I haue walked in the fields and sought 
where to weep, being ready to roare out in the bitternes of my 
soul, keeping up usually secret prayer and other dutys, but 
when the worke was wroght to a moneth or year I cannot tel, 
or whether it was not of a long time after that, — that wch hath 
put me to a sad stand in my selfe-examining worke, hath been 
lest al those shakings, should be onely the fruit of education, 
and common workings of the spirit, but the experience of some 
others in the like condition, and the conclusion of Mr Baxter 
in that case hath much stayed my hart, that god doth often 
make use of a religious education by natural parents as a 
meanes of first begetting converting grace yea he concludes if 
parents were faithful and skilful in those relatiue dutys, that 
god would owne that worke to so great an end, and that pub- 
lick preaching of the word should be the more usual meanes of 
confirmation then conversion — 

I doe with thankfulnes to god remember, that many a time 
my dear mother did zealously and familiarly presse upon me 
truths of the greatest concernment, as the preciousnes of the 
soul, the misery of man by nature, the necessity of conversion, 
the brevity of life, and importance of eternity &amp;c : She had 

the more oppertunity to familiarise these things to me, because 
she used to take me along with her to hear Mr Horrocks at 
Dean, Mr Harrison at Walmesly, Mr Johnson at Ellinborough, 
and sometimes to goe to Denton to hear Mr Angier, and upon

lords days and other occasions I was usually her attendant ab- 
road, and then she took much paines with me in helping me 
out with what I had written, the benefit wherof I haue found 
many ways since, — I confesse I tooke much delight in waiting j 
upon her abroad, but w T hat my ends were 1 cannot tel, yet this 1 
I beleeue, that god disposed of it for much good to my poore | 
soul, yea I am sometimes thinking it may be god made that 
time a time of loue, and that there might be some seeds of 1 
grace then in my hart wch sprouted out afterwards upon occa- j 
sion, my secret troubles were greater then any in the world 
knew of, I think it was the devils policy to cause me to keep 
my troubles to my selfe, that he might better wear them out, j 
and that my soules birth might proue abortiue ; but god ; 
abundant grace, that prevented me with his blessings of good- j 
nes, and sought me, before I thought of him, hath also followed j 
his works, and many times seconded and revived convictions ] 
in my hart to much advantage, how T often haue I thought my 
state in some respects to be worse then that of birds and ; 
beasts, trees or stones, because by sin 1 am subject to eternal ' 
misery, wch they are not capable, sometimes I durst not pray, j 
lest I should take gods name in vaine„and thus by fits I had j 
my inward troubles, feares and doubts,— 

When I was about 14 yeares of age I was entertained into j 
the society of .some godly Christians, we were aboue 20 yong j 
men and others, who joyned togather by the instigation of an 
ancient godly widow woman, and propounded necessary ques- 
tions and held up a conference every fourtnight and prayed 
our course about, where 1 was (tho being yong and raw) some j 
times excercised, this was maintained a considerable time in 
winter nights. I was much afraid lest it should come to the 
eares of my schoole fellows and I should be derided for it, how 1 
like was I to ISTicodemus therin, yet better to doe so, then not I 
come to cht at al, a night disciple may proue a noone-day pro- 1 
fessor : I had much incouragement in those undertakings from J 
my dear parents and others, yet not without discouragement I 
from abroad, but the most, and worst was in my selfe lest I I 
had built without a foundation, and lest my profession should I 
vanish for want of a right principle of grace to feed and inain-B 
tain it : yet god bore up my hart and brought me through I 
some difficulty s, and temptations wch I had from some of my ■ 
schoolefellows that were wild and rude and in danger to haue 1 
perverted and subverted my poore soule $

about that time I received the lords supper at Bolton, and 
thought I felt some suitable qualifications for and powerful 
impressions in my hart, by that precious ordinance, tho I con- 
fesse 1 was not prepared according to that exactnes required 
in worthy communicants, and haue cause to be humbled : I 

had always a very reverent esteem of the ministry, and from 
my infancy a great desire of that office, yea such were my high 
thoughts of those in that function that I could scarce beleeue 
any of them could be bad but that they should al be saved. 
When I was a little child I delighted in imitating preachers in 
acting that part amongst my playfellows, wch being observed 
by my parents with other passages inclined them to dedicate 
me to the worke of the lord in that service ; when a gracious 
old woman observed that in reading I had a strong voyce, she 
would aske me if I would be a preacher, my answer was, yes if 
I might be a good one. I must confesse, since I had any 
understanding at al as I haue held them in singular loue and 
honour that haue been godly ministers, so I haue accounted 
them wretched burdens of the earth, and the worst of al men, 
who haue been prophane in that office, and I am now more 
confirmed therm, that a wicked preacher is as the tayle of al 
rational creatures, and doth most hurt among men, and shal 
haue the greatest torments among damned spirits, eo deteriores 
et unferiores, quaiso meliores et feliciores esse debent : 

My dear parents trained me up at schoole tho not very 
young, and I was through dulnes or negligence, long in learning 
my letters, which was a discouragement to masters and parents, 
yet after I came to learn of old Mr Rathband (that reverent 
and eminent man of god then silenced by the bishops) god 
helped me to make considerable progresse and proficiency, and 
tho I was set back at first for the better regulating of my 
reading english, (in wch I had been but ill taught) yet after- 
wards I was set a good step forward with those aboue me, wch 
stirred up greater endeavours in me. In al my learning at 
schoole I found that my capacity was better then my memory, 
and yet both something dul and slow, yet if once a thing 
i§iir had been imprinted in my mind, my memory was tena- 
cious, and loath to part with it of a long time, yet I find 
an apparent difference of my selfe since I came to maturity, 
for I can better get a thing now r into my mind then keep it 
there, it quickly slips from me, whence that should proceed I

know not, except the variety of objects now draw my thoughts 
into many channels, whence they were formerly intently running 
in one current upon acts and objects of the same kind : but to 
say truth, I haue found my parts haue been very weake, and 
my natural facultys exceeding slender, not capable of any sub- 
lime and elevated learning ; I haue often wondered what the 
design of god might be in casting me upon ways of preparation 
for the ministry, whence I am conscious of more dulnes and 
weaknes in my intellectuals then I think most are ; there 
are thousands that haue abundantly more natiue inge- 
nuity passed by and not put into these ways of doing god 
service, who would haue been more eminently useful in their 
places especially this office, but I see god is a wise and free 
agent, and goes beyond our apprehensions, he lookes not as man 
lookes, his thoughts are not as our thoughts, his design is some- 
times to crosse the common road of his ordinary dispensations, 
that it may the more remarkably appear the work is wrought 
by god and not by man : I haue sometimes wondered that I 

was never stopped by masters, examinater and parents in that 
cause, upon the discovery of my natural weaknes and unfithes 
for that worke, for none was more unlikely to make any proofe 
in that calling then I, tho my desire was so much caryed out 
unto that great imployment (whatever my ends were the lord 
knows, but I haue cause to fear they were mostly selfish) that 
I used my utmost care to haue my weaknes covered, and that I 
might not be detected, and so diverted to some other calling* 
wch I could never indure to think of, nor indeed was I very fit 
for neither, in many respects ; I see now my god designed me 
to greater workes and higher ends then worldly workes and 
cumbring trades, to which my mind was always much averse, 
also unexperienced — 

I was much retarded in my learning by change of schooles 
and variety of masters, and negligence of some of them, and 
sometimes taking off, at last lighting upon an eminent schollar, 
and skilful teacher, one Mr Eudal, I was by gods blessing 
upon his endeavours in a short time in some measure forwarding 
and fitting for the university, and I profited more in one year 
there then in four elsewhere, as I sensibly discerned — wherin I 
cannot but acknowledg the lords goodnes to me, that he should 
be instrumental for teaching me good humane litterature who 
had little else of any worth in him, that I should be kept from

youthful vanitys where bad examples were presented from supe- 
riors and equals, there being many great mens sons whose 
extravagant spirits then were working and since haue too too 
sadly verifyed that dreadful scripture of the paucity of rich 
men that are saved, and not many noble, are called — I looke 
upon it as one observable passage in my life, that I should in 
any degree suck the juice of authors I read, and masters that 
taught' me, without the woeful contagion of my soul by those 
pestilent vanitys I haue seen in both : 

When I was about 18 yeares of age in the year 1647 I went 
up to Oambridg, and w T as placed in Trinity Colledg where Dr 
Hill being then master, my father was advised by him and one 
that waited on him (one Mr Birchal a good friend of my 
fathers) to admit me under Mr Akehurst, who then was a flour- 
ishing instrument, and was lookt upon as most 
pious and laborious in al the colledge, tho since [I hear he is 
he hath grievously apostatized, and at this day reduced and is 
is a common quaker, as I am informed, unles a sober phisi- 
lately reduced. But then I must confesse he tian in Surry 
was careful of me, inquired of me what com- 
pany I was acquainted with, sometimes read lectures to me, 
prayed with me in his chamber every night, and had sometimes 
about 80 pupils, and as I thought was a gracious savoury Chris- 
tian, tho I haue often taken notice of his inconstancy, and 
being singular in differing from graue and sober divines, and 
pride wch was too visible in apparel, gesture, and outward 
tokens therof ; this I speak not to despise or disparage any, 
much lesse my superiours, and instruments of good to me, but 
to take warning, and magnify discriminating grace, that I may 
be thankful and jeolous over mine owne hart, for if such cedars 
fal what shal become of such a shrub as I am : 

When my dear and honoured father left me at Cambridg, he 
writ downe some serious and graue instructions wch he left 
with me, besides those many others wch he and my affectionate 
mother had frequently inculcated in their savoury discourses 
and conferences, and they were such as these, 

1 my son, labour aboue al things to make your peace with 
god by humbling your soul evening and morning and oftner 
before him, yt you may know god hath begun a good worke of 
grace in your hart ; 2 be very frequent in reading the scrip- 

tures with knowledg and understanding, that you may be a good

scribe, armed agt temptations, and able to convince gainsayers ; 
3 labour to get every day some sanctifyed thoughts, and 
spiritual meditations, wch is a heavenly life and walking with 
god, and write them in a booke and title it the meditations of 
my youth, 4 take short notes of every sermon, and write some 
faire over for your loving mother, 5 often remember how 
short and precious your time is, and yt upon it depends 
eternity : 6 keep a mean, neither be too solitary, lest you be 

melancholy, nor too much desire company lest you be drawn 
aside, and aboue al take heed of bad company, and seek out 
for good : 

these rules I had often an eye upon, and tho I confesse I fel 
farre short in obedience therto, yet for the outward part therof 
I endeavoured to practice accordingly having writ downe such 
meditations of mine owne, and sermon notes wch I tooke after 
that precious instrument Mr Hammond who preacht at gyles 
church, and sent some (that I writ faire over from that text 
about the strait gate in luk 13 24,) downe to my friends in the 
country, — I must confessedly -hart was many a time very much 
affected under the ordinances there, and I cannot but with 
thankfulnes acknowledge him a profitable instrument for much 
good to my soul, tho the worke might be wrought before, yet I 
am sure then it was much revived, cleared, and many mistakes 
removed, oh with wt a frame of spirit haue I come from that 
place, I usually met with a suitable searching word, that warmed 
my hart, and I met with some ingenious and gracious 
schollars with whom I had intimate familiarity, and was 
much furthered by them in the ways of god. I looke 
upon it as an admirable mercy of god that I was preserved from 
those wicked or idle companions that might haue prevailed for 
the utter undoing of my soul and body, for my nature was too 
too flexible, and hart inclinable to sin and vanity, tho I haue 
cause to lament my losse of time there, wch hath been an 
harvest for laying up treasures of humane and divine knowledge 
that I might haue as a good householder brought out things 
new and old for storing and others soules, had 1 been as careful 
as I might and ought, yet its a mercy I lost not but got some- 
thing to my soul there for I haue observed many persons very 
hopeful and towardly at their first arrival there that like Naomi 
went away empty of goodnes, and instructed in artificial con- 
trivances of wickednes, that haue been poysoned themselues

and haue proved a pest and offence to the church, and haue 
been indeed what the oratour charged Paul with falsly and 
causelesly, pestilent fellow ! some haue I seen by degrees neg- 
lecting their studys, and in time growing deboist in practice, 
others foolishly haunting erroneous company and turning either 
scepticks or erraticks from wholsome truths, both sorts planted 
a noble vine under the tuition of godly parents, afterwards 
becoming degenerate plants of a strange vine, tho others haue 
also been planted in the house of god and at length proved 
pillars in the temple, and glorious instruments of much good : 
among whom not a meane instance I had experience of in too 
brothers both my companions ; the one turning quaker and a 
licentious creature at this day, the other a precious minister, and 
useful instrument, tho both hopeful, yet the latter and junior I 
had many a time comfortable comunion with who feared god 
aboue many, and tho of a different apprehension in point of 
discipline, yet of a moderate spirit, and precious in the sight 
of god and much indeared to me — 

There also I received the lords supper in the chappel, and 
found (as I thought) much advantage to my soul, tho it may 
be I was not prepared according to the purification of the sanc- 
tuary : My design was to lighten my fathers burden of main- 

taining me, (living in the comfortable degree of a pensioner) 
by endeavouring to get a schollarship, but I was prevented that 
year by a sore and grievous sicknes, a strong and long continu- 
ing fever, wch I made ful account would haue put an end to my 
days. My tutour was very careful of me and provided physick, 
and a nurse to attend me, tho costly, whence another schollar 
at the same time dyed, as was thought for want of care about 
him, in that desperate disease my sad thoughts of my state 
(being yet unceartaine) put me upon desiring a reprieue, and I 
begged that god would restore me, that I might be serviceable 
to god, and I solemnely promised with the help of grace if god 
would recover me to devote and dedicate my selfe to the worke 
of the ministry if god gaue me oppertunity, wherin I hope I 
could in sincerity say my principal desire and design was the 
glory of god in winning of soules to jesus cht, this serious vow 
I haue desired frequently to review, and performe, I cannot free 
my hart from selfishnes and vainglory but if it doe not wofully 
deceiue me this was in the bottome : god was pleased in too 

moneths time to recover me, and tho I had sent to my friends 

h 



in the country to signify my condition, yet by miscariage of 
letters they heard not of my sicknes til they heard of my re- 
covery, wherin I observed a providence for the preventing of 
my indulgent mothers sorrow, and after that, I had not the 
oppertunity of standing for a place wch with the accession of 
charges for maintaining my brother also, was a burden to my 
fathers purse, and a trouble unto me, yet we were both resident 
in the colledge til we tooke the degree of batchelour of arts : 

All that time I was in the university my heart was much 
deadned to and in philosophical studys, nor could I as I desired 
apply my mind so close to humane literature, tho I blame my 
selfe for it, for I prize learning aboue al sublunary excellencys, 
and I might haue been more useful had I improved my time 
better therin, but my time and thoughts were most imployed in 
practical divinity, and experimental truths were most vital and 
vivifical to my soul. I preferred Perkins, Bolton, Preston, 
Sibs far above Aristotle, Plato, Magyrue, and Wendreton tho I 
despise no laborious authors in these inferiour subservient 
studys. 

When I was to come downe and leaue the Colled g my tutour 
asked me if I would teach country people, my answer and then 
resolution was to goe liue a while with some godly auncient 
minister in the country, and make approaches to that weighty 
calling by degrees. I continued at my fathers house about 
halfe a year and durst not meddle with that weighty worke, 
that scripture being soundly set home upon my hart, who is 
sufficient for these things, and the charge of soules being so 
formidable an imployment, and a miscariage therin being so 
easy, and so dreadful : but unawares I was intangled in a 
preaching worke, for visiting some far beyond Preston, where 
I had the oppertunity of the secrecy and obscurity of the 
place to make an essay in that uncouth worke, I begun to 
appear in publick, and continued it with some other friends in 
Craven, both at Carleton, and at Skipton, and at niv returne 
home I found too ancient godly men come from this place in 
Yorkshire, waiting for me at Bolton, and having obtained 
liberty from my father for a days pains at Coley, I came along 
with them, where after my worke beyond and contrary to my 
expectation they treated with me for a settlement in the place, 
but I durst not meddle with that both because of my owne 
rawnes and insufficiency, and because my father had not been

consulted with at whom I durst not ingage, as also because way 
was made for my living in Mr Angiers house, to which ther 
was a free consent on al hands, and a great desire in my selfe, 
rather then any other course : But I know not by what strong 
hand I was induced to promise my paines another day at Coley, 
tho I missed the day and took a journey into Wales, and was 
absent three or foure lords days, and most concluding I would 
care no more sought for another man, and pickt upon one Mr 
Hargreaues who preacht too days here and was by the generality 
wel approved of, and almost closed with, onelv those godly 
friends of mine expecting my coming to performe my promise, 
held off, and durst not appear for him, at last I came, and was 
very glad there was hopes of my dismission from them, but 
such and so many and strange were the providences about it 
that I durst not, but take it a little more into consideration 
yea and treat with them about my settlemt &amp; at last conde- 
scended, being induced therunto by the concurrence of many 
signal providences, as that the harts and prayers of the best 
people should so much incline towards me, having some days 
sought god about it and receiving incouragement therin, the 
greatnes of the congregation, and their diligent intensiue 
attendance on ordinances, whom I saw scattered as sheep 
having no shepherd, and my hart compassionated them, tho I 
knew I was an unfit person to be their pastour, the absence of 
the other man disappointing them yt day he had promised to 
come, wlierby I had free liberty for preaching, the multitude 
that flock t up to shew their free consent and cal of me, the 
councel of those I lookt upon as my best friends, and my owne 
inclination at least to gratify them for a while in that depth 
of winter, in wch they were likely to wander abroad. Yet my 
ful resolution was that when that halfeyear was expired to be 
at liberty and remove. But tho I so purposed yet god hath 
disposed otherwise of me, for tis near ten yeares that I haue 
continued here, tho at my first coming my design was not to 
settle at al, or at least not to stay a year, — I was ingaged to 
this place at Halifax about Novemb 26 or therabouts in the 
year 1650 wher the heads of the congregation met me, — 

I looke upon my first coming to Coley as a considerable 
epocha, and juncture in my life, about wch much of gods hand 
was seen, for there were some obstructions in my way of 
settling, and many precious effects of my settlement both to

my selfe and others, — indeed ther were some blocks laid in the 
way, partly from my owne unwillingnes to undertake the 
worke, especially in this place, my parents unwillingnes that I 
should be at such a distance from them, Mr Tilsleys vehement 
dissuasion therefrom, and persuasion to close with Haughton 
chappel (from whence Mr Horrocks was lately gone to heaven) 
with great promises of what he would doe for me there, — and 
divers the like impediments wch was afterwards discerned to 
conspire for my joyning here as god disposed, and we saw since 
that this closure was good for us al, partly the preventing of 
another coming to the place who afterwards made but il proofs, 
partly for good to mine owne soul who had the help of some 
ancient Christians, but especially my coming hither was to the 
better in respect of the fruits of my labours, and I haue no 
reason to repent or be troubled (unles it be for my unadvised 
entring on this great worke) since it hath proued for the saving 
of many soules aliue, the lines fel to me in a pleasant place, 
and I haue been abundantly satisfyed in this corner of the 
lords harvest allotted to me, tho there are many richer, and 
larger, and holier, yet it hath been most suitable to me and I 
to it, and I may look on it as my joy and my crowme, and blesse 
god that I haue not run in vain, or laboured in vaine ; 

the place of my habitation almost foure yeares togather was 
at Landiuiar, a family in every respect as fit for me, as any I 
could haue met with, for the head and master of the house 
(tho very kind and courteous to me) w*as as the epitome of car- 
nality, wmrldlines, and carelesnes, w r ho became a notable schoole, 
booke and occasional teacher to me in the then infancy of my 
ministry, in conversing with w'hom I got much insight into and 
was wel furnisht for answering those carnal pleas and cavils of 
misguided soules, since otherwise I had been unacquainted 
with their objections, because my education, and former con- 
versation had afforded me little experience in these cases, and 
besides it gaue me occasion to pity and pray for his precious 
soul, seeing the w’oeful blindnes and wretchednes therof, and tho 
god did not answer me in that (being at the 
writing herof newly taken away to his long [April 26 1660 
home without any evidences of repentance) 
yet he hath returned an answer for others and may doe for his 
posterity in after times. But besides that accidental advantage 
I had also singular help in the society of some precious,

humble, gracious-christians that I found in the family, especially 
a servant, a good old disciple (John Woodhead now long since 
gone to heaven) who in conference, and otherways did adde 
something to me, with whom I haue taken sweet councel, 
walked constantly to publick ordinances togather, prayed and 
wept in private, and sitten togather many a night for mutual 
advantage : besides divers other precious ancient Christians in 
the congregation whose soules were dear to me, and breathed 
their last with endeared thoughts of me, whom I frequently 
remember with sorrow for my losse, and joy for their gaine, 
yet herin I haue observed a special hand of gods wisdome and 
providence, that while I was yong and tender and stood in 
greatest need of such companions I injoyed their communion, 
but when he had further trained me up with them to higher 
proficiency, he housed them with himselfe, tho yet I need them 
being exceeding weake and poore, but it was my sin that thrust 
them away, either in not improving them, or leaning too much 
upon them ; But surely it was a weakening of my strength in 
the way, yea the removal of such gray headed Christians was a 
shaking the foundations of the congregation, and when such 
pillars are removed what can such poore creatures doe ? our 
god Hues, there our hope, and blessed be our rock, and protectour 
My first apprentiship of almost seven yeares I passed on 
very quietly and comfortably without any disturbance, and with 
as much incouragement in some regards as my hart desired, 
while the blossome was budding it was faire sunshine, and 
calme weather, but wn I came to some maturity (at least when 
I could better bear and abide it) I found many a bitter blast, 
and nipping frost, the lord warded off the malevolent tongues 
and hands of men that they did not assault me, not a dog did 
moue his tongue agt me, that I know of, and indeed they had 
not that occasion, for while I but preached the word, the 
sharpest passages, being onely in general, did not much exas- 
perate, however they did not shew their teeth as since they 
haue, — the worst and wickedest did not expresse much opposi- 
tion to me, tho I doe not therfore judge my selfe as better 
deserving respect then other godly ministers, oh no, I am the 
most unworthy of the tribe of Levi, yet few haue had so large 
a share of comfort, because it may be god saw I needed more 
incourageint being weaker then others, and that a little oppo- 
sition would discompose my spirit, and hinder my progresse,

therfore he spared me as a man doth his tender child, he gane 
me a quiet harvest for my laying in, and laying out, for he 
knows our frame, and considers how disadvantageous it is sow- 
ing in a storme, he stilled the raging of the sea and tumult of 
the people, and gaiue me liberty to muster and prepare for 
further service, to rig my ship for stormes, to fortify my selfe 
by degrees and lay in ammunition and provision for a siege, 
that my forehead might become flint and brow brasse agt the 
warfare of iniquity, oh that I had got that wisdome and courage 
in the day of preparation that I might haue stood up, and held 
out more comfortably, and victoriously in a day of 
tryal, truly I might haue been ful of power by the [mic ft h 
spirit of the lord, and of judgmt and of might, for 
this great worke : 

Thus I continued in a quiet and uninterrupted studying 
privately and preaching publickly about too yeares before I 
was ordained, in wch time I did not look upon my selfe aw a 
minister in office, but a probationer and candidate for ihe 
ministry and could not goe on with that comfort and confidence 
that since I haue done, 

I did therfore addresse my selfe to the second classic in 
Lancashire, convening then at Bury in my natiue county, and 
was there ordained presbiter August 4th 1 652 : divers reverend 
ministers being of that association, wherof some are living 
and others are fallen asleep, especially those too ministers (at 
that time ) at Bury Mr Ault and Mr furnace, the latter dying 
shortly after, the other since : I confesse I had many sad 

thoughts and feares about that time of my ordination, not ^ 
much in respect of the temporary excercises required as pre- 
paratory therunto, but principally my great insufficiency for 
that high and holy calling. Such an impression it had then 
upon me, (tho I knew not the tithe of the dutys and difficukvs 
therof then yt I haue felt since) that I had been totally 
deterred and discouraged therefrom, had not the outward and 
inward call from heaven, the concernments of gods glory t nr. 
churches necessity, the intentions of my parents, the com lo- 
tions of my conscience, and dedicating my selfe to god • ■

My ordination was solemnly caryed on with fasting and 
prayer, it was a great assembly, some of my owne charge being 
present therat, and witnesses therof, god was pleased to cary 
me comfortably through the excereises of that day, mightily to 
inlarge the harts of his people in prayer, and graciously to 
afford assistance to al that were imployed in the worke of the 
day. Mr Tilsley excellently and profitably giving the exhorta- 
tion : there were many teares powred forth that day — partly 
in thankfulnes for returnes of prayer, partly for further increase 
of grace, great importunity and inlargement in petitioning a 
blessing upon that days worke, wherin god was pleased abun- 
dantly to giue a pledg and preludium of future and further 
successe, I was persuaded god had a design to giue, because he 
stirred up his people so earnestly to aske, and tis not in vain 
to wait on god : 

It hath been often much satisfaction to my spirit in the 
midst of my troubles to review my regular entrance into the 
ministry. I had the unanimous cal and consent of the people 
manifested by imposition of hands and names for election, and 
four ancient men sent as delegates to represent the whole, accom- 
panying me thither, wher by fasting and prayer, and impo- 
sition of hands, I was set apart to this great office ; one of 
them that went along with me, being within a week after his 
return home struck with a sicknes unto death, told me near his 
end, that the manner of carrying on that work was so satisfy- 
ing to him yt tho he had some scruples before yet it was a 
meanes to convince him that it was indeed the way of god, in 
wch persuasion he dyed, wch is something considerable, being 
so gracious a man in the accont of al, as Anthony Wilson was, 
and so ancient a Christian : yea and I must confesse, I haue 
found abundantly more assistance in my ministerial dutys since 
then I did before, the lord having borne up my hart with more 
comfort, confidence, courage, and inlargemt, yea and hath made 
my labours more profitable and successful, often beyond ex- 
pectation, for altho I cannot cal to mind that any one soul was 
clearly brought over to jesus christ by my meanes before that 
time, yet now I have many eminent and apparent seales of my 
ministry in their unquestionable saving, yea some that god made 
use of me to work upon did persevere in the zealous profession 
and practice of religion til death, and are now I am persuaded 
triumphing with god in glory, besides a considerable number 
that are aliue and actiue in the ways of god : 



168 Autobiography . 

After I had continued here a considerable time my necessitys 
within and without put me on seeking a suitable yokefellow, 
and god’s providence directed my cause to divers, and then 
stopped me in my progress, many times had I good hopes and 
was sometimes near a conjugal relation, and again disappointed 
by some strange meanes or other, wch was no smal trouble to 
me, yet was instrumental of much good to me, to humble my 
hart and send me more frequently and ardently to the throne 
of grace, I was often afraid of missing my way and as often 
begged direction, pleading that promise that god will teach the 
humble his ways, and the meek he wil guide in judgment. I 
desired not to follow mine own fancy but god’s councel such 
observable providences as I observed about these things at this 
time did mightily prevail upon me to wean me from the world, 
and set my hart on heaven,. I aimed at many things that I 
could not accomplish which broke me into a moderation of 
affection (tho with much difficulty) after any created excel- 
lencys, — yea I haue been convinced therby of the deceit of 
strong impressions and persuasions that such things should 
come to passe, even upon paying which the event disproves, 
and therby I see plainly god leaves himself e the liberty for 
time and way, tho he wil and doth giue always such a returne 
as is best for us I may say abundantly better than the particular 
cases I propounded : 

Then the lord struck me with a grievous fit of sicknes, living 
with my owne dear brother at godly, from whence I made ful 
account I must haue taken my flight into eternity, it was the 
third time I had been visited with a strong fever, august 1654, 
then and there had I the sentence of death passed upon me, 
and despaired of life with al that saw me, I was violently sur- 
prised with strong pain and sicknes in the publik ordinances, 
and was compelled abruptly to break off in the forenoone, and 
was with very much difficulty got home, the disease increased 
apace, and quickly came up to its height, and begot in me such 
tormenting pains, with a bitter agony in my soul, that I feared 
being overwhelmed by gods frownings and satans buffettings 
in that weak and weary condition, yet in the midst of my sad 
and drooping thoghts divine comforts did delight my soul, 
and though I had clear tasts of divine loue, my soul desired 
death rather then life, or rather a better life by meanes of 
natural death, o what would I haue given that 1 might haue

sinned no more, but haue departed into that blessed and blisful 
communion with god of wch my soul had a little transient 
tast, I was loath to be turned into the world agen. Yet I was 
freely willing to submit to the disposing wil of my good god, 
and it seemes he had yet some more worke for me to doe, and 
he did recover me, and after three weeks sicknes did send me 
again into the great congregation, to speak of al the wonderful 
things he had done for my soul. I lookt upon my selfe as a 
brand pluckt out of the fire, the lord in that time much en- 
deared my dear people to me, and me to them, and prepared 
me for further usefulnes in this place, and I plainly see a more 
then ordinary design of god therm, for I haue had a far greater 
harvest of soules then ever I had seen before. Tho 
I was sick nigh unto death yet god had mercy on [phi 2 27 
me, and many in and with me, for had I dyed then 
little of my work had been done in comparison of what hath 
been since accomplished : I cannot say but god had done 

some good by me before but the most hath been done since, he 
loues to cast downe first and then lift up, to diminish and then 
multiply, to bring to the graue and say returne, and brings 
therwith a traine of special mercys as in the case of Hezekiah — 
Not long before this had there been proposals to Mr. Angier 
concerning his daughter wch after my recovery were renewed, 
and seconded with consent and contentment on both sides, the 
same hindrances seemed to lye in the way, wch god did abun- 
dantly clear up and remoue, and at last through various inter- 
changeable providences and occurrences the marriage was 
solemnized, April 25, 1655, it was carryed on with more than 
ordinary solemnity, there was a very great assembly ; many of 
the gentry and ministry, Mr Harrison preacht an excellent ser- 
mon from eph 5 30 they too were one flesh, there were many 
mortifying considerations to wean my hart from my relations, 
my new father being sick and could not then stirre out, my 
dear yokfellow betwixt contracting and manage weakly and so 
distempered that the day before yea that morning she thought 
she could not endure out of bed any time together, and a few 
days after she was surprised with a feaverish distemper wherby 
I had thought the lord would haue snatcht her away by death, 
and many a signal of mortality hath my god manifested to me 
in her and my little ones : truth it is, god hath granted me a 
singular mercy in my dear relative and knit my hart to my

sweet wife by many invincible bands of cordial loue, both 
natural, moral, and spiritual, and the object being so desirable 
and suitable unto me hath proved exceeding contentful, and 
profitable to my state, yet it was a greater compliment to my 
farther complacency in her that she was not only religiously 
descended even from many generations but that her immediate 
parent was and is the peer of preachers in these northern coun- 
tys. So gracious, faithful, and successful a minister as Mr. 
Angier being reverenced in the eyes, ears, tongue, and hart of 
al, none hauing occasion to open their mouth agt so useful an 
instrument, it exceedingly pleaseth me to thinke that the de- 
sire of mine eyes is the fruit of the body of a gospel-preacher, 
wch calling I prize more highly for the greatnes of the work 
and transcendency of its ends, then the highest preferment in 
the world, — and tho she was little in stature and weak in 
strength yet my god was pleased in processe of time a year 
after to bestow a son upon me, and again a year after that 
another, John and Eliezer, in both wch the infinit omnipotent 
power of god was apparent, as in al womens childbearing the 
arme of god is made bare to a wonder, so in this it was dis- 
cernable even to a miracle, tho when she was at mariage by 
most even given up as hopeles for bearing children, and to 
nature almost as impossible as Sarahs barren wombe, yet god 
shewed wonders on the dead, and she hath brought me forth 
three fine sons, and hitherto hath helped me beyond expectation, 
and tho god that gaue hath taken away one, viz Nathaniel, 
borne Aug 1659 and dyed within a fourtnight, august 24 — 
those too I haue I desire to devote and dedicate unto the lord, 
and I look upon it as the greatest honor if the lord shal spare 
their liues, and make them useful in his house to glorify his 
name, and convert precious soules to god, they are yet yong 
and tender, and- my hart trembles for fear of them, and earnes 
over their immortal soules. I foresee this what I haue now is 
a smal part of care I shal haue over them when they shal come 
to age, and get abroad into the world, and if I know my owne 
hart I would rather they were removed in infancy then liue 
long to dishonor my good god. My incouragement is they lye 
under a good covenant, and I hope he that is the authour of it 
wil not suffer a child of so many prayers and 
teares to perish, tho neither my hart nor house [2 sam 23 5 
be so with god as I could desire yet he hath made

with me an everlasting covenant, and this is sufficient satisfac- 
tion and salvation, tho for matters of the world it should not 
flourish, but diminish : Whether I liue or dye I know not 

where to trust my selfe or mine so wel as in the hands of a 
loving, merciful, and covenant-keeping god — 

In processe of time when I had continued almost seven yeares 
in the congregation I was convinced of my duty to endeavour 
to set up discipline and restore the ordinance of the lords sup- 
per, wch after many disputes and carnal reasonings I set upon, 
and made an attempt, I had many discouragements in my first 
thoughts therof, and loath I was to ingage in such untrodden 
paths, it being uncouth and odious in the country, my first 
work was to preach many sermons about that weighty subject, 
partly to stirre up in believers a desire therof, partly to show 
the way for the obtaining of it, and preparation for it, and 
suitable dispositions fit for a profitable participation of it, and 
at last fel to exeeution. I desired a meeting, many came and 
when I had acquainted them with the way I aimed to take, 
and desired them to make a choyce of some oficers, that might 
assist me in the worke (tho that could not be yeelded to) then 
I resolved to doe what could be done myself e. I intreated al 
those that desired to partake of that ordinance to acquaint me 
therwith, that I might discourse with them, about the main 
fundamentals of religion, for I confesse it hath always been my 
principle, that grossly ignorant and scandalous are to be 
debarred from that sealing ordinance, there came to me about 
120 persons, from most of wch I received abundant unexpected 
satisfaction, and found more knowledge, true piety, and con- 
victions of conscience then I had before that made account of, 
many were exceeding glad of the opportunity they had to open 
their conditions to me who had been long hindered in their 
resolutions that way by prejudices, occasions, and many temp- 
tations. I found it so refreshing and incouraging to me that 
it did abundantly compensate my labor, if I had made no fur- 
ther progresse in the worke then onely obtained so much 
acquaintance with the spiritual state of many soules, and when 
I had finished that work I communicated the names of such as 
I had dealt withal to the whole, and earnestly intreated that 
if any had any just grounds of exception against any that they 
would discover it before we proceeded to administration ; and 
tho there were many secret surmisings yet no objectors ap-

peared, and for those that were yet groundedly suspected of 
visible unworthines, tho none could or would stand up to 
debarre them of incroaching yet the lord acted that part, and 
by the forenoones sermon prickt their consciences, and diverted 
their intentions from sitting downe, wch might I fear haue 
heen a great distraction to some Christians, yea others resolving 
to stay tho not submitting to order, and so to disturb us, were 
driven back and we know not how unlesse by the special and 
signal hand of god immediately thus we injoyed the ordinance 
peaceably and comfortably, and it was very precious and pro- 
fitable to the soules of such as had been long waiting for the 
salvation of god, this was the first ordinance we have injoyed 
or that was administered since these late uncivil civil warres in 
this perplexed nation, and it was a day of glad- 
ness, and feasting, for the joy of the lord was [Neh. 8 10 
our strength, and having obtained help of god 
we have continued in the frequent and (usually) monethly 
celebration therof aboue this too yeares, and gives us grounded 
hopes of the further continuance therof. 

But as every good worke meets with opposition, either from 
pretended friends or professed foes, and as usually the way of 
god (as vertue) lyes betwixt too extremes so that cht is ordi- 
narily crucifyed betwixt too thieues, so here, on the one hand 
some directly oppose making any distinction at al but would 
haue al to lye common, and would haue the blood of cht pro- 
stituted to al comers yea contemnors of it, these beat downe 
purity with the odious charge of novelty, on the other hand, 
others pleading for an unwarrantable groundles separation, 
would be wise and righteous over much, and scrue up the pin be- 
yond the reach of the word, and lay that stresse on circumstan- 
tials wch the scriptures doe not, and we dare not, these are apt 
to challenge us with conformity and complyance with the world 
and with loosenes in our principles and practices, from both 
sides I haue received grievous buffettings and may sadly say 
the latter hath been far more prejudicial to my work and 
affiictiue to my spirit then the former ; the wicked of the world 
wil be medling, and shooting hasty bolts, David was the drunk- 
ards song, and every one hath a reviling flout to bestow on 
such as walk not in their road, tho condescending as farre as 
they can possibly, but alas its not so much wonder if these be 
not skilled in these weighty matters, a parable beseemes not

the mouth of fooles, and if these hate strictures, and break al 
bands asunder that may hinder them in the pursuit of lusts, 
lawles liberty is their design and custome is their reason, and 
their wil their law, and they are wiser in their owne conceit 
then ten men that can render a reason these we may not think 
strange at if their licentious practices put them on catching 
hold of licentious principles to vindicate the same, and fret and 
fume when great Diana fals, and cry after their priviledges to 
wch they haue no right, as Micah after his gods, yet would be 
indulged in ignorance, vanity and security — tho these haue 
sometimes pleaded zealously for me, and would haue put me in 
their bosomes, and pretended so much loue as tho they would 
haue pluckt out their right eyes, (yet notwithstanding suspect- 
ing their principles I depended not upon them and durst not 
trust their fond and groundles affection) now at last because I 
crost their humour they railed on me, and would almost pul 
out my eyes in violent contradiction, and use their utmost 
endeavours to thrust me out of place, truth it is I expected no 
better from these, but worse : But I may say with David it 

was my familiar friends, and intimate associates, yea I hope 
(some of them) sincere Christians that are the greatest trouble 
to me, and in this they are worse because I expected better, 
yea some that haue professed endeared loue to me, as their 
spiritual father, these pretending scripture grounds would 
throw the nation and congregation into a confused chaos, yt 
they may model new churches, and lay a new foundation dis- 
paraging and despising the old principles, and professors that 
haue been of for many yeares standing in this place, would 
they joyne their hands wth ours in reforming abuses, and 
build upon the old foundation we should gladly joyne 
with them, and might . be mutually helpful each to other, 
and lay no more stress upon relating experiences, and joyn- 
ing in a covenant, then the Scriptures doe, and for their 
right, and limited ends, truth it is my earnest desire after 
peace and unity, for our owne advantage, and mutual 
edification put me upon studying many meanes for com- 
posing our differences and frequent meeting together for 
accommodation in what we could, that wherin we were agreed 
we might walk together in loue, especially those common and 
confessed truths and ways of god that neither satan nor our 
common adversarys that watch for our halting and bear an 



174 



equal il wil unto us all, might not issult over us divided, when 
they dust not meddle with united, and for this end I used al 
the meanes I could, and condescended as far as wel as I durst. 
So as not to wrong conscience that we might meet in one, yea 
so much am I delighted with the name of peace, (dulce pacis 
nomen) that I haue cause to be jealous over my selfe lest I 
lose a grain of salt for an ounce of peace. I have gone to the 
utmost brink, my principles, conscience, and the word of god 
would reach, that I might become al things to al men, but alas 
our meetings and complyings haue done little good, nay its 
well if it haue not done some hurt, tho accidentally and prseter- 
intentionally, for the lord is witness to the singlenes and sin- 
cerity of my hart and aimes in those undertakings tho the 
prejudices of men haue put various misconstructions therupon. 

But whiles we* were consulting an accommodation, suitable 
to the uniting product of godly partys on both sides in our 
neighbour county, in comes an overflowing deluge in the 
state that promotes divisions in the church. Sr George 
Booth with many other gentlemen pleading their liberty to sit 
and vote in parliament with the rest of their members then 
sitting at Westminster at last took up armes in Cheshire with 
whom the presbiterians generally accorded, and consented, and 
the independants took the other side throughout the nation, 
wch as it rendered al former endeavours fruitless and an agree- 
ment almost hopeles, so it set a vast distance amongst us in 
this congregation, many of our adversarys being deeply ingaged 
in the late defection thought they were bound in conscience 
(tho from what principle, or end they did it I know not) 
prosecuted agt me as one of those they lookt upon as traytors, 
and rebels, yea whatever their ends were the lord knows I 
shal not judge* but tho I know they dealt most injuriously 
with me as tho they intended to trepan me they came to dis- 
course with me pretendedly in loue and friendship, and got 
what they could out of me in state affaires, and then when 
they saw their opportunity threatened they had in writing a 
charge agt me uttered unawares by iny own lips, and their 
own jeolousy helped them to invent other things wherin they 
imagined I was guilty tho farre otherwise, and I may truely 
say as in the presence of god they laid to my charge things 
that I knew not, nor did they ever enter into my thoughts, 
they wrested my words, and when I desired liberty to be mine 



own interpreter, if it were contrary to their groundles sur- 
misings they called and accounted me a lyar, they condemned 
me without tryal, and when a considerable appearance of my 
people came to owne me at a meeting, they would scarce giue 
them or me leaue to speake on my behalfe. Some of them 
openly contradicted me by sending a note to me in the middle 
of my sermon to distract me, tho blessed be god it prevailed 
not to do me much hurt, they trampled scornfully upon me, as 
scarce worthy to liue, some of them saying they could not tel 
how to trust their bodys with me much lesse their soules, that 
they could not sit downe under any mans ministry that would 
not obey authority tho themselves were the most disobedient 
changing them at their pleasure, many times in a year if they 
suited not their ambitious and covetous humours, and tho they 
could never charge me as disturbing the peace in word or 
action, but this I must confesse I could never say amen to their 
prodigiously irregular actings, nor act agt my conscience, for I 
must obey god rather then men, I could not durst not dissemble 
with god and man in giving god thankes for what I was con- 
vinct was real matter of humiliation. I kept in the compasse 
of my place and calling, and was freely content to be passiue, 
in suffering the penaltys inflicted for the breach of their new- 
made laws, — yea such was their cariages towards me that their 
owne party elsewhere disclaimed them, and were ashamed of 
them, and voted some of them blame-worthy in a church-meet- 
ing, and the country did so ring therof that the reproach 
therof wil never be wiped off : truth it is this was such a pro- 
voking occasion (the circumstances considered) for the commo- 
tion of my spirit as I never had before, that 1 could very il 
brook or beare, and I found great need of special grace, and 
an oppertunity to practice some of the hardest lessons in Chris- 
tianity, to bear injury s without desire of revenging my selfe, 
to suffer grievous in ligntys patiently, without animosity, when 
wrongfully imposed, to forgiue freely. Pray for such as de- 
spiteful ly used me, to loue mine enemy s and overcome evil 
with good &amp;c I never knew what these lessons meant til now, 
and I may say by sweet experience the lord helped me in these 
cases in good measure, by the help of grace I haue not used 
perverse reflections agt them in publick, nor did it yet enter 
into my thoughts to doe them the least hurt, if I had them in 
my power, nay I can truely say the more they wronged me the 
more I prayed for them,

Autobiography. 



About the same time we had sharp tryals, my wife was 
brought in bed of a third son and when she had lyen but too 
days 1 was taken prisoner by a party of horse sent from Col 
Lilburne, and I was taken to Brigge house, but by the media- 
tion of divers of my neighbours who undertook for me I was 
released after I had been among the unruly souldiers one night, 
and within that fourtnight my little son Nathaniel dyed Aug 
24 1659 and the sad news of our dear friends and countrymens 
killing and dispersing was more bitter then al the rest, at wch 
time these men triumphed over us with intolerable pride, 
threatened sequestration, shot off a pistol by our window, and 
had once tantum non driven me from my dear people once 
indeed I did resolue to goe within a day or too, but being better 
advised I thought it best to abide their trval for I knew my 
selfe not guilty no not in the breach of their owne laws. But 
god hath his times and seasons of clearing up the innocency of 
his people, he hath wonderfully owned the cause of his afflicted 
people, and rescued both out of the furious hands of one 
extreme that sought the destruction of ministry and ordinances 
under the notion of sanctity, and tho in eshewing Sylla we be 
now fallen upon charibdis, yet god wil fully reckon with and 
totally subvert the professed haters of the power of godlines 
especially when he hath accomplisht his reconciling worke 
upon the harts of his people, and effected al his other works 
upon Mount Zion, satan is come downe and hath great rage 
because his time is short and short I hope it will be, for he 
hath promised that for the elects sake those days shal be 
shortened, yet sharp it may be, for god hath a sad reckoning 



with us — 

In the midst of these publick feares and woe- [Removed 
ful disasters god called home to himselfe my from Northour 
dear and precious wife, after she had lived with to Norwd 
me to my exceeding comfort six yeares&amp; about a green May 10 
moneth, it was the heaviest personal stroak that 1660 being 
ever I experienced, yet the lord hath abundantly forced away

are many things that may tend to aggravate, 
and on the other hand to moderate and extenuate the

affliction, but that wch I would study is what gods design is to 
me therin, aud to look after the advantage therof — for in al my 
losses, the want of the fruit of an affliction is the greatest 
losse. She was as comfortable a daughter to her father and 
wife to her husband as ever lived, she grew up to a wonderful 
maturity farre beyond her yeares, it may be much disputed 
whether her graces or parts were more pregnant and flourishing, 
ceartainly she excelled in both, but I say no more here for I 
design an history of her life and death wch I am sure wil be 
worth my labour. She dyed at Denton May 26 1661 — yet this 
I may say tis as apparent and afflictiue a weakening of my 
strength in the way and in my work as ever I met with to lose 
a wife, and such a wife, at such a time as this seemes to cary 
with it not onely a grievous but anxious breach, I want her at 
every turne, every where, and in every worke. Methinkes I 
am but halfe my selfe without her. But why should I complain 
she is at rest, gods wil is done, I may shortly follow her, sure 
T am she cannot returne, nor doth she desire it, and then I 
ought not, the affliction is more deep and cutting then any 
that ever I had and the supporting, quickening, and comforting 
grace beyond what ever I experienced before in al my life, my 
god supplys al my wants according to his riches in glory by 
cht jesus, onely i am afraid of living and loosing that frame of 
spirit begot by gods spirit under this dispensation : my incour- 
agemt is that to paul my grace is sufficient for thee, 

my present state for domestical affairs is this, July 28 1661 
at the writing herof, I keep house with one onely maid and my 
too little sons, and I blesse god we line sweetly togather, I 
haue had motions and tenders of another maid, but my friends 
juJg it best to continue as I am and I blesse god I cannot be 
better furnished, she is my child as wel as servant one of my 
first and best converts to the faith, and that spiritual relation 
hath much endeared us, sober, solid, and of a tender conscience, 
tho ful of scruples yet fearing god aboue many, laborious faith- 
ful, in whom the children take great delight, a great mercy to 
me in this solitary condition : 

Some three or four years agoe having a fit of sicknes I read 
over Mr Baxters Gildas Salvianus or reformed pastour and was 
so convinced and awakened there with that I resolved if I re- 
covered to set upon the work of personal instruction, but 
multitudes of busines fel in, and the conviction dyed and I

neglected hitherto, but being again summoned by this awaken- 
ing providence of my wines death, and further inquiring more 
narrowly into my sins past, and future or present duty, I found 
this amongst the rest, and therfore reassumed my ancient reso- 
lution, set a time a part for intreating the lords direction and 
blessing then upon my selfe alone, studyed and preacht about 
it and set upon the work on the tuesday after june 25 1661 
going from house to house, resolving to spend one whole day 
or too halfe days in the week, and liaue been at aboue 20 
houses, and haue been taken oft by accompanying my Be ve rend 
father Angier to York and abroad, I found in most places very 
free and welcome entertainment, and good incouragement, 
sjrne better some worse then I expected, al very willing to be 
instructed, 

indeed by reading another book of Mr Baxters I haue 
brought my selfe into a snare, for in his disputations about 
right to Sacraments, one of them is levelled agt the baptizing 
of the infants of scandalous parents, in reading wherof I was 
so puzzled that 1 was not able to answer his arguments, and 
durst not doe as 1 was wont in that administration, but turned 
some away that i knew were notorious sinners, but herin I 
haue neither satis yed my selle nor others the hardest thing to 
me is how to judge of persons, and others are much offended 
with iny practice herin, for 1 am convinced I sometimes baptize 
the children of those th.d are as bad as those I haue sent away, 
tho 1 doe not know* that, so that it were the easiest for one to 
baptize al or none, but herin I would follow' the convictions of 
my conscience from scripture and reason tho agt my ease, 
profit, credit, 

But times and things are now changed so that the parish 
church of Halifax having a vicar who that he may not loose 
his dues (wmh yt were never received by me, wt I did therin 
was gratis) hath caused notice to be given to al the ministers 
at chappels to prohibit our baptizing any, tho I doe that worke 
since, as I see good, and they overlook it, so long as they haue 
their usual pension ; 

But behold a black cloud thickens up on us in this congrega- 
tion, my old adversarys haue now got that advantage agt me 
they haue been long seeking, ana thinking the day is their 
owne, since their old friends the Bishops are again voted to be 
restored to their dignitys another sort of people enter upon the

stage to be our rods, and urge us to a conformity to their 
humours in ecclesiasticks as the former in politicks, and now 
we must comply to humane ceremonys or haue our mouths 
stopt — 

Upon the 25 of August 1661 Stephen Ellis and too others 
had procured one Robert gibson a church-warden living in 
Lightliffe to tender to me an old common-prayer book, wch he 
had begd of his mother the week before, who offered it to me 
as I went into the pulpit, I asked him by what autority he 
tendred it, he gaue me no answ. but when I would not take it 
he laid it upon the cushion, I took it downe and laid it in the 
lower pulpit, and went on in my usuall manner, but was won- 
derfully assisted that day in praying and preaching so as many 
were amazed, as since they haue told me, and it satisfys me I 
did but my duty in what I did upon my former convictions, 

But upon Septemb 13 a bailiffe of Halif (whom they haue 
made an apparitour) brought me a citation to appear at St 
peters in york that day fourt night to answer Will greenwood, 
who is an atturney lately come amongst us, and is put on by 
the other too. I consulted with many what I should doe and 
was adviced to make some appearance and by my selfe or by a 
proxy, or they would excommunicate me for contempt, accord- 
ingly I resolved upon a journey, and light accidentally of the 
company of my dear friends Mr Wales and Mr Sayles, who used 
their utmost interest on my behalfe, but so it was that I must 
appear my selfe, or fee a proctour wch I was resolved not to 
doe, so I went to the minster and approacht towards them 
sitting in the void place on the north-side of the minster 
(where they say the consistory court is wont to be kept) who 
were very busy with other matters, but wn I came close to them 
totally desisted, and called my name, to which I answering 
they asked. me, if I had a proctour, 1 told them no I was ther 
in person to answer my charge, they said no more to me but 
appointed me to come again that day three weekes, I desired 
to know then what was laid agt me wch they refused, and told 
me I should know the next time, so 1 took leaue of them for I 
saw they would not goe on with their other busines til I was 
gone. 

One whom I then knew not, immediatly after comes to me in 
the minster (one Dr Witty as himselfe told me his name was) 
w T ho perceiving I had been at that court desired to know of me

what they said to me. who when he understood what the matter 
was, very much ineouraged me, and often urged me not to be 
apal'.ed, b it to answer them resolutely, for sth he they haue yet 
no autority, tho they expect it at the next session of parlia- 
ment, therfore they cannot bite, tho they be now whetting 
their teeth, he further informed me of the persons in the court, 
and said he that sate as chiefe with his hat on (one Dr Broome) 
was Dr of the law, and sate there onely to initiate them, and 
theu would leaue them, he told me I was the first minister that 
was cited by that court, but thought many others would follow 
me. and therfore intreatcd me to stand my ground couragiously 
for an example and incouragemt to the rest, with many the 
like words wch I hope I shal remember agt the next encouuler 
My hart was much grieved when I saw the fond way of 
worship used by them as I passed by the doors where they were 
then at worke, divers I saw with the white surplices, and red 
tippets upon their backs their worshipping towards the east at 
saying gloria patri. their singing the lords prayer and the creed, 
and resonding of the organs, a! wch they use, tho I stayed not 
then to see and hear all, yet I saw enough to make me hate 
vain inventions and to loue gods perfect word and pure worship 
better, to pity and pray for them that mangle and trifle with 
tlie holy things of gou, and turae them into a meere formality, 
to desire after and delight in the pure and wholsome waters of 
the sanctuary, and worshipping my god in spirit and in truth : 
The day they appointed me to come was on Octob 18, but it 
was an oversight in them, for the proctor, one Mr Wadington 
told me at Bradford that it was an holy-day, and nothing would 
be done, therfore appointed me to come the friday after, but 
being called away into Lancashire I neither appeared nor sent 
a proctour, wch my dear father Angier advised me to haue 
done in a letter, but the letter miscaiwing I went my journey, 
and when I came to him he told me he feared excommunication 
and told me an instance in the same case of one in manebester 
that was so censured at Chester for non-appearance, I put it to 
the venture, and upon my retnrne there was another citation 
for me, wch I made bold to wave also, not onely bee the notice 
was short (coming to me upon the Wednesday to appear upon 
the friday) but also because my lady Watson of Yorke had sent 
me word not to stirre afoot in obedience to their commands, 
because as she said they haue yet no autority, and this our

liberty hath been lengthened out unexpectedly : and once agen 
we haue injoyed the priviledg of the lords supper, novemb 10th 
1661 tho the last time we had it we did as it were take our 
leaue of it and of one another therin for a considerable time. 
Surely god hath some wise end in leaving us to such uncear- 
taintays for our libertys, and feeding us from hand to mouth 
giving us long and fair warning of an approaching famine and 
scarcity, and inciting us by the long impending cloud of 
danger to lay in spiritual provision, surely he shews himselfe 
unwilling to remoue, and very willing to leaue upon our harts 
the good of ordinances, seconding them with the variety of 
providences — 

I had also a third citation, wch I observed, and tho I ap- 
peared yet I was not called til I gaue notice that I was present, 
and they dismist me with promises of a faire audience the next 
time, since then I haue had no intelligence from them, but 
onely that their proctour writ to the apparitour shortly after 
that there was a suspension out for me, wch yet was never exe- 
cuted and I haue seen no more of it but the threatening in 
that letter ; Hitherto god hath helped : and now I am but 
in the same proedicament with the rest of my brethren in the 
ministry since the passing of this fatal act of uniformity, wch 
we are waiting for the execution of, wch commence th from the 
24 of Aug. wch if not prevented wil strike dead most of the 
godly ministers in England : 

But the restlesnes of the spirits of mine adversarys hath 
anticipated that season, and they haue now at length procured 
my deposing, for they haue obtained a suspension from the 
Archbishops chancellour for me, wch was published at Halifax 
church on lords day last june 29 1662 — wherin these below 
expresse theii malice in preventing of 6 or 7 days oppertunity 
of preaching til in al probability I had been swallowed up in 
the common calamity and they aboue haue mist the marke in 
laying the cause of my suspension upon my non-appearance 
and contempt of their admonitions, wherin they mistak since 
I did appear, and likewise never received any admonitions 
from them, yet they haue suspended me from the execution of 
mine office (as they say) tho they hold I am not in office, 
because I want their episcopal ordination, for want wherof and 
other reasons my friends advice me to make no addresses to 
them to get off my suspension, but silently wait til the lord

open a doore for me otherways or by a general deliverance, and 
thus am I at present laid aside in this diocesse, and accordingly 
I tooke my leaue for present of my dear congregation at Coley 
the day aboue mentioned, upon wch occasion I saw more strong 
workings of affections and teares of sorrow then I haue ever 
before seen in publick, and who knows what effects this provi- 
dence may produce to set home and help to the improuement 
of ordinances, this eclipse of the gospel may tend to the 
furtherance of the gospel, however the lord help ministers and 
people to know the plague of their owne harts, and submis- 
siuely accept of the punishmt of their iniquity, and in his due 
time he wil arise and haue mercy upon Zion, when the set time 
is come. 

And now I am further cast out of church assemblys by an 
excommunication published at- Halifax novemb 2d 1662, and 
were it just how formidable would that sentence be, but the 
curse causeles shal not come, and cht owned the poore ejected 
man with more free and familiar entertainment, tis usual with 
god to communicate himselfe most to those that are forsaken o f 
their hopes and friends, o that my god would now take me into 
more intimate communion with himselfe — 

Again a citation was procured from Chester and was set upon 
the church doore at Bolton Decemb 7, and after that an ex- 
communication published at the same place jan 4 166§ agt me, 
for preaching a funeral sermon at Bolton a little before, but by 
a special providence none of my natural relations heard it, 
being absent, and the person doing it voluntarily taking the 
work on himselfe togather with the odium attending it, but 
satan is overshot in his owne bow, that wch was intended for 
my greatest ignominy is turned to my greatest glory, and hath 
set the people of god upon owning me and praying for me more 
then ever, yea there hath been unwonted importunitys for my 
poore company at several houses where very many came to hear 
the word of god even in the night, by wch meanes I am per- 
suaded much good hath been done, yea the lord is making 
some use of me also at home among my poore people. 

meanes hath been used for taking off* my excommunication, 
to satisfy my reverend lathers request upon that account, but 
al is ineffectual, nothing wil serue but a total complyance, the 
chancellour being moved therin said I could not haue my abso- 
lution without taking an cath de parendo juri et stando man- 
datis ecclesia so the proctor writes to me.

tho men forsake me, yet my god takes me up, and the worse 
men deale with me the more sweetly doth god' communieate 
himselfe to me, and raiseth up friends to entertain me with 
more endeared affections, for tho I be excommunicated yet the 
lord stirred up my dear father Angier to admit me to the seal- 
ing ordinance of the lords supper as wel as to hearing the 
word on inarch 1th 166§ where and when the lord wonderfully 
manifested himselfe to my poore souie, awakening, quickening, 
softening, sealing my soul, so that I can scarce remember that 
ever I had such inlargements in a publick ordinance in al my 
life, oh that the impressions therof might be lasting upon my 
hart to fit me for further services and sufferings in the re- 
mainder of my life : 

On june 10 1663 there was a great meeting at Coley Hal 
where Mr Jolly was to preach, but as it pleased god I was in 
Lane : the souldiers had intelligence and came to apprehend 
them but were disappointed, the persons met having notice of 
the design, wch night they came to my house to search, but 
found not their prey, yet since they haue got information con- 
cerning several persons and haue bound them to sessions, and 
to good behaviour, divers haue escaped them whom they are 
now searching, others they are sending to prison upon other 
accounts, yet hitherto I haue lived quietly at home, tho they 
often watch my house to get a clear advantage agt me, and tho 
they know of some solemne meetings I had been at to preach 
the word yet hitherto hath the lord restrained them 

on Wednesday Aug 12 (63) towards night came to me three 
several messengers to bring me word that the troopers would 
come that night to apprehend me : and desired me to with- 
draw out of the way, I told them I had not broken either gods 
law or mans law so as to deserue any punishment from them, 
therfore I resolved to stay, hoping that my integrity would 
preserue me and my known loyalty to god and the king would 
be my best apology agt the imputations of men about my plot- 
ting, wch is the common pretence to secure men, but my 
escaping would seem to plead guilty : accordingly I staid and 
slept as sweetly as ever I did in al my life without the least 
molestation ; and many other times haue I had the like merci- 
ful protection and prevention after such like alarums, so that 
tho I was the first person that was medled with in these parts, 
yet hitherto god hath been a defence upon my habitation, so as 



184 Autobiography, 

my body and goods are preserved, and I may set up the stone 
Eben-ezer, hitherto the lord hath helped to admiration : 

About this time I rose up timely upon a lords day morning, 
and resolved to goe to peniston to hear a friend of mine who I 
heard was to preach there that day, but being alone I lost my 
way, and thinking it would be late before I could get thither, 
I turned to Honley to hear Mr Dury, who preacht not that day 
and after some overtures made for my preaching there but in 
vain, I went to Hulmfirth, where unexpectedly at noone both 
the preacher and several of the people gaue me a cal to preach 
that afternoone, well I did, and found sweet inlargemts in that 
worke, and tho my adversarys haue heard of it, yet haue not 
assayed to molest me for it, it may be my missing the way may 
find a soul — 

I had again another cal to preach at a place called Shaw 
chappel in Lane : wch I willingly embraced, and there preached 
(octob 11 1663 — ) the whole day without any disturbance, 
where (tho it was a very rainy day) were gathered from many 
parts a great number of good people, and there was visible 
stirrings of affections, and who knows but the lord might doe 
much good, the strong desires and great paines people take to 
hear the word may quicken ministers to adventure themselues 
to be found breaking this bread of life as they haue an invita- 
tion and oppertunity : nor hath there been any trouble to me 
or to my hearers for that days work hitherto, tho there hath 
been troubles attending others for the like attempts yea and in 
the same place : 

But such is the actiue malice of some others that upon lords 
day last there was another excommunication of me published 
at Halifax (Decemb 6 1663) that that busines may be surely 
done, but the meaning therof truely I cannot tel, but desire to 
make some spiritual use of it, and get so much nearer to god 
as men cast me out from them : 

yesterday (being decern: 20 1663) I heard there was to be 
preaching at Coley chappel, and after long debate what I should 
doe, at last I resolved to goe to the chappel to hear 
[Mr Moore what doctrine was delivered to my beloved people, 
of Beldon for 1 heard that an Antinomian was to preach, and 
being there the church-warden came in fury to 
me before the minister tooke his text and would haue taken 
me out, wch for several reasons I refused, he charged the mini-

ster to forbear preaching to an excommunicate person, I re- 
plied if he would not preach I would, but after a pause he took 
his text and preached, tho so far as I could judge not much to 
edification, considering the premises I stayed at home in the 
after-noone where I had an abundant tide of the spirit more 
then ever I experienced (that I remember) wch carryed me out 
in affectionate prayer for the church, and melting praises, it 
was a day much to be observed, for I cannot remember that 
ever my heart was in such a frame, or yt ever I had more sen- 
sible communion with god, so that my adversarys did me a 
good turn agt their wil, and I found that scripture verifyed,

Whiles I was musing and pondering how to get my rent 
discharged and had no way at this time but to borrow it, there 
comes a dear friend to me and brings me fiue pounds, wch did 
furnish me with an overplus besides my rent, it was a season- 
able token sent to me by a liberal hand, yet I own god chiefely 
in it, who cares for me, as in this and several other experiments 
is evident oh what a sweet thing is the life of faith, thats a 
perfumed gift that thus comes from god as a loue-token after 
the actings of faith in prayer — how good is god to me ! I hue 
nobly, and am so far from wanting that I haue al and abound, 
and where supply fades one way god makes it up another way, 
and many times where I expect most I am most disappointed, 
and help comes in from whence I had least reason to look for 
any ; but this I may say, the lord is my shepheard I shal not 
want : and hitherto god hath helpt : 

Many wonder much at my safety and liberty hitherto, espe- 
cially considering my deserts and the rage of mine enemy s, tis 
now a long time since they threatened me with a prison and 
now but a while agoe I had intelligence from a friend at York 
that the proctor who appeared for me to get off my excommu- 
nication, had received a shrewd rebuke for speaking on my 
behalle, for in the court there was strange prejudices agt me 
as a strange creature, some of my adversarys had informed 
upon oath that I preach stil, and that when some persons came 
to disturb me I beat them with my cane, wch are palpable 
groundles lyes, yet my intelligence told me that there w T as a 
warrant in the hands of some justices, wch the proctor sth he 
saw, and desired me in prudence to avoid it, this came to my 
hands one night when 1 had purposed a journey into Lane, the

morning after, and so confirmed my resolutions, I went and was 
a moneth from home, and when I had dispatcht my 
[aboue 10 visits returned home, where I haue been openly 
weekes and quietly now almost 7 weekes, and hitherto hear 
of no danger, wch is beyond my expectation, and 
to the admiration of many : 

Yea besides my civil liberty I haue hitherto in joyed spiritual 
priviledges tho in private yet with comfort : yea I haue had 
the communion of Saints in a considerable company at my 
house every week day or night since I was debarred oi publick 
opportunity : yea tho the church-warden and constable be very 
near neighbours to us, yea the one is so malicious that he hath 
been seen to watch the house himselfe, and hath been known 
to set others to watch my house. 

Yesternight aboue al the rest is a night much to be observed, 
and deserues an asterisme of memorial being the evening of 
March 28 1664 : when we had appointed a meeting, notice was 
brought that some persons had promised hi W to find out and 
acquaint him with our meeting that he might catch us togather 
upon wch some that were wont to come absented themselues, 
tho several others at a distance came that formerly haue not 
been with us and god watcht over us and kept us in safty : 

Yea more then that, al the while we were togather, viz from 
8 a’clock to 11, there was a most sweet pleasant melodious 
singing of birds about the house, as delightfully as ever I heard 
in al my life, and I was much taken with the musick, al the 
company heard it and wondred at it, and al said it was more 
then ever they heard before for birds to sing so sweetly in the 
night, and at this season, immediatly after al the company was 
gone away I went out, but could not hear so much as a chirp- 
ing or any noyse of a bird at all : I humbly and beleevingly 
take this as a token for good, and a signe that our summer is 
near, and the time of the singing of birds is not- far off : Cant 
2 12: and it may be an evidence of gods protecting providence, 
according to that in Isai 81 5 as birds flying so wil the lord of 
hosts defend Jerusalem — or of our exemption from the eauseles 
curse of a malicious and malignant excommunication : pro 26 2. 

Several overtures haue been made for settling of a minister 
at Coley, but it hath not come to perfection, one passage is 
remarkeable, that one Mr Fisden came and offered himselfe, 
but that would not take; tho he was a man high enough for

conformity, many went to hear him in the morning, but few in 
the after noon : the next day he was generally deserted and as 
they tel me, not aboue halfe a score persons came to chappel 
wch he seeing thought they were not worth one of his sermons, 
and therfore read a few prayers, and dismist them, and went to 
Halifax, this man threatened what conformity he would bring 
the people into or punish them, yet his own party being 
ashamed of his deboist cariage durst not adventure to hire him, 
and so he went away : 

But another coming out of Craven and being commended to 
them by the vicar is now in gaged as Minister at Coley for a 
year, and they are to giue him 40 pounds, it was a very sudden 
act for it was upon too days acquaintance to any of them, so 
far as I hear, Mr Pattison alias White as elsevvher he called 
himselfe— -he was hired on April 25 1664, being that day wch 
they cal St Markes day, that same day of the 
inoneth upon wch I was maryed to my dear [after he had 
deceased wife 9 years agoe : and thus the lord got 3li he run 
hath divorced me from some choyce outward away we heard 
comforts and from my dear congregation, and no more of 
from al oppertunitys of doing good in publick, him 
and in great measure in private, since they 
haue quartered him at a neighbour house to me : 

And now at last this fatal blow is given to my liberty, for 
my restles adversarys haue procured a writ de excommunicato 
capiendo, and the lord did providentially bring it upon me, by 
an occasional meeting of the bailiff e who had a processe to take 
me, upon the third day of May 1664 : yet hath been exceeding 
civil and courteous towards me : and was willing to dismisse 
me so that I in joy my ful liberty still beyond my expectation

out of my bed before sun-rise by a considerable number of 
persons who came to hear the word of god, and there came 
another company in the forenoone, and stil more in the after- 
noone, and we injoyed al the day in peace, freedome from dis- 
turbance, and abundant spiritual inlargements, it was a sweet 
day to my spirit tho painful to my body, but having so fair a 
call, and ful an auditory, I laid out my selfe, not knowing but 
it may be a parting excercise, and I find that wn 
Act 20 7] paul was ready to depart he continued his speech 
til midnight, and I cannot spend my selfe in a 
better worke, blessed be the lord for his goodnes yesterday, I 
question not but the lord wil hear prayers, accept praises,’ and 
doe our soules good by our fears and tears and troubles : 

Yea I haue injoyed yet a more precious oppertuniLy the last 
lords day [May 15] for going to Peniston to hear Mr Swift, 
who to this day injoyeth his liberty (excepting a three moneths 
imprisonment) he importunately urged me to preach, wch I 
was over-intreated to doe, I was imployed both ends of the day, 
and tho I found not such special assistance of the spirit as 
sometimes I haue, and did expect, yet the auditory was much 
affected, and who knows what good it may doe in so large an 
auditory, for it was a great assembly, and many came very far : 
a gentleman in the parish sent to me at night, signifying that 
he heard I was in some trouble intreating me to lodge with 
him at his house as long as I pleased, and he questioned not 
but in an ordinary way of providence I might be safe there, I 
thankt him but resolved to returne to my family, and commit 
my selfe to the lord, who I hope wil still watch over me, as 
hitherto he hath wonderfully done : 

the providence of god about my liberty hitherto is much 
admired by al, and deserues very great thankfulnes, accordingly 
I prevailed with some friends to joyn with me in that sweet 
duty may 25 we had many things to blesse god for in this sad 
day of jacobs trouble and indeed the lord made it a most sweet 
and ravishing day to our Spirits, a proeludium of further mercy 
in return of prayer — 

A strange providence is likewise fallen out about the place, 
the man whom they hired a moneth agoe is run quite away, and 
comes to them no more, tho he went but to fetch his wife, and 
promised to come that week, ther was great preparations for 
him, and expectations of him, his wife sent to seek him at

Coley, and they here sent to seek him in Craven ; but cannot 
hear of him, the report was first that he was drowned or made 
away : but upon inquiry tis found that as he went home-wards 
he fel a drinking 2 or 3 days, for they of Coley had given him 
3 li — ios — out of the rents wch they had in their hands to 
supply his necessity s, and in a bravado he cast lots whether he 
should goe north or south to seek a place, and tis said he is 
gone south-wards : this providence is the more observable, 
because they had procured this man in spite and opposition, 
and for a snare, Stephen Ellis being churchwarden belched out 
grievous threatenings how he would punish the fanaticks in the 
place, sd he would work a greater reformation then ever Hey- 
wood could doe, went to several houses to charge them to come 
to the common-prayers, or he would fetch away some cows, 
and there was no sermon in the place since that, he now frets 
and chafs agt this man that is thus unhansomely run away, 
threatens to punish him, and others are much offended, for 
their own prejudice and the reproach thats in it : he borrowed 
horse, money, bootes and is run away with all, and his sermon 
was found verbatim in a printed book so that he was traced by 
the sent of an intelligent hearer even as he was preaching it : 

Another day of publick liberty the lord hath now graunted 
me, on lords day last, being june the 5th 1664 I preacht at 
motrarn church upon the invitation of the churchwarden, and 
with the consent of the vicar (tho a conformist) who was there 
and heard me both ends of the day, and was very desirous to 
haue me come again : I biesse the lord who did graciously 

help me to deliver his truth with some measure of inlargement, 
and without reflections, wch seldome doe any good, but often 
much hurt : 

on thuesday june 7 we had a private day for seeking the 
lord m prayer, there was a considerable number of Christians 
in the Roome wch was my father Angiers study. I was put 
on duty first, and continued about three houres powring out 
my soul before the lord, principally on the behalfe of his 
church it was a very sweet day, and a token for good, the lord 
warmed my heart exceedingly and the hearts of others and wil 
eeartainlv return answer to al those affectionate groanes, and 
importunate prayers : but another time on the like occasion at 
j Denton hal in a private fast, tho ther was a great assembly I 
was much straitned and found my spirit much out of frame, oh

the wisdome and goodnes of god therin ? god with-draws to 
hide pride from me : 

[july 13 64 yesterday being at Shibden hall to visit a friend 
there I was desired to tarry dinner, they had in- 
vited some friends, amongst the rest Mr Hooke vicar of Hali- 
fax, who would not stay dinner, because as he sd he was bound 
up bv his canons not to eat with an excommunicate person, 
and tho he would haue gone away yet I rather quit the place, 
then that he should either loose his dinner, or be defiled, or 
his conscience perplexed : 

Stephen Ellis our church-warden came to demand four shil- 
lings for my absence from church four sabbotlis my servant 
answered that if I came he would put me out of church, yes 
sth he, and so I will too, for the law must be executed, both to 
keep me away and punish my absence : 

Notwithstanding the act against conventicles commencing 
from the first of july, last, and the rage of our enemys about 
home, and the visiblenes of my house, yet we haue had every 
lords day (that I haue been at home) a considerable number 
(double the number wch that act alloweth), to keep the sabboth 
with me-, and hitherto we haue been in safty, without disturb- 
ance : 

Yesterday (being August 21 1664) we had a most sweet day, 
my manner is to spend the time as we are wont to doe in pub- 
lick ordinances onely we are longer in the duty of prayer, 
wherin I usually spend an houre in the forenoone in confession 
and petition, and an houre in the afternoone in the creat and 
sweet duty of thanksgiving, wherin the lord hath wonderfully 
inlarged my heart far beyond my expectations : blessed, for 
ever blessed be his name : 

this day (being the day after) being left alone in my house 
and therby having the oppertunity of secrecy, I with-drew my 
selfe into my chamber and set my selfe to the solemn duty of 
prayer, but immediatly after I was fallen upon my knees a 
base unworthy temptation violently set upon me. but having- 
through the lords assistance overcome it my soul feir, sweet in- 
largements for a considerable time in confession, petition, 
thanksgiving blessed be god for that token of good : 

this fatal day (Aug 24 1664) the black Bartholomew day, we 
were resolved to keep as a solemne fast and did so at a neigh- 
bour ministers house and haue in joyed a sweet soul-satisfying

oppertunity, the lord helped his servants with strong crys, 
many teares, and mighty wrestlings, to acknowledg sin, accept 
of punishmt and implore mercy, after too yeares death upon 
the ministry, sure I am god bottles al these teares, these 
prayers shai not be lost, from this time forth I wil hearken 
.what god wil speake, he wil speake peace to his saints, for 
when he prepares his peoples hearts to pray, he wil bow his 
ear, to hear : this days sowing is a sweet earnest of future 
harvest : 

this day being septemb 2d there was a visitation or correc- 
tion to be at Halifax, multitudes of persons were cited, and 
many appeared, they went to church, had a few prayers went 
into the chancel, called their names, and then went to dinner, 
after dinner they sate in the checker chamber at the Starre, 
but when they were in the throng of business the chamber 
floore fell, and many fel down into the cellar below, and tho 
none were killed (not falling far), yet they were exceedingly 
affrighted, and some beare spoyled : that very day I had ap- 
pointed a meeting for prayer at my house and tho we were but 
few yet the lord wonderfully helped our spirits, and by obser- 
vation of the time I find that the forementioned providence 
was just as I was at duty, and truely I found extraordinary 
assistance, and inlargemt in prayer, and I take it as a quick 
and sudden return of prayer, and a presage of future farther 
mercy : one observed that I prayed affectionately that god 
would bring down those vexing courts, the proctour and his 
son, and the apparitour fel about that instant into the cellar — 

When I was preparing for and purposing a journey into 
Lane, on thuesday sept G 64 : there came a messenger to me 
requesting me to preach at peniston, the lords day following, 
and because oppertunitys of that nature are but rare, I waved 
my first intentions and embraced that motion, and upon the 
same day having the advantage of solitarines in my house I 
went into my chamber and prostrated my body before the lord 
al along and earnestly begged of god that if he called me to 
that publick work that he would doe some good to me and by 
me, but upon the day and in the duty I find not that assistance 
I expected, and haue often enjoyed : But upon the thuesday 

after at Denton, 1 had another invitation to preach the lords 
day after at Motram, and tho I travelled that week and had 
little leisure for preparation, yea tho I was under some indis-

position of body yet I found abundant inlargements in my 
soul, liberty of speech, and assistance in the work, the congre- 
gation was extraordinary great, who knows whether shal prosper 
this or the other, however I adore infinit wisdome and goodnes 
in both : 

octob 2 being lords day, having some company with me in . 
mine own house, I was wonderfully inlarged in mine own house 
in the performance of mine accustomed dutys, but upon the 
mnnday morning I was left to commit a sin, I could not rest 
but (being left alone in my house) I went into my chamber, 
laid my selfe before the lord, my heart was wofully shut up and 
god did apparently with-draw, tho I made several essays to act 
repentance, at last I found some sensible workings, but then 
came a friend to the doore and I was interrupted : my soul 
cannot bear inlargements ; god punisheth security : oh what a 
manifest change in a short time ! my soul beware of sin for 
future wch breaks off communion with god, spoiles peace of 
conscience, and begets torments, and danger in recovery — 

yesterday, being the lords day after Nathan Whitleys man, 
and one Widow Bancroft watcht under the gates in the fore- 
noone while I both prayed and preach t, and gaue out many 
bitter threatening words both to my servant and to others, yet 
we were in quietnes togather al day without disturbance, blessed 
be god : 

since then I hear there are several persons suborned to watch 
my house, who comes to me upon a lords day, and giue notice 
to sir John Armitage who purposeth to surprize us togather as 
a conventicle according to the act and cary us to prison : 

But now at last there is an honest minister 
the first day] come to Coley, and is ingaged here for a quar- 
he preacht at ter, one Mr Hoole a very late conformist, who 
Coley was oc- preacheth wel, and is a pious man, and ther- 
tob *23 1664 : fore I am resolved not to draw any from the 

publick ordinances, but incourage them to 
wait upon god therin, and pray for the blessing of god therupon 
for doing good to many soules, yet I fear my adversarys wil be 
his enemys for following that wch is good in any thing, tho he 
doe con forme

his work of publick preaching without conforming) I did hear 
him in the morning, but at noone after dinner Mr Dinelaw 
(the gentleman of the place) moved me to preach in the after- 
noone, I told him I was willing if Mr Crosley was content, and 
if it might not prejudice them, they al unanimously desired it, 
and referred the consequences therof to gods providence, that 

I took as a cal from god, and adventured to preach, and the 
lord was graciously seen in giving me unwonted liberty of 
speech and spirit, both in prayer, and preaching, and affected 
the hearts of his people ; blessed be god : such a season is 
worth a prison : let me obey gods call, and doe his wil, and let 
his wil be done upon me : 

this lords day being Decern 4 64 keeping my house, and 
spending the forenoon in my usual excercises with a freind 
that had been al night with me, at noon there came several to 
me, expecting my pains with them, I had nothing provided, 
but withdrew my selfe about halfe an houre for meditation, 
and the lord helped me with a profitable discourse upon ps 86 

II : and wonderfully inlargd my heart in prayer al day : 
blessed, blessed be his holy name : oh the flood of teares : — 

because I haue a great desire to wait upon god in publick 
ordinances tho it be but to hear this minister at Coley I haue 
therfore sent to a friend at York to consult with some whether 
I may not according to the Bishops laws goe and hear the 
sermon in publick tho I be excommunicated, as they cal it, the 
answer that I haue now received, on Decemb 12 64 is this, 
that Dr Hitch (now Dean of York) sth yt an excommunicate 
person is not allowed to be present at prayers or sermon, yet it 
being usual for such to hear sermons without disturbance he 
wonders any church-wardens should be so ignorant or malicious 
as to hinder any from hearing the word, he said he would not 
deliver his judgment for an hundred pound under his hand, 1 
haue (sth my intelligencer, I think a proctor) searched the 
canons, and haue consulted with divers ministers about the 
case, and their opinion is that there is no law prohibiting any 
person heathen or Christian to hear the word-preached, this is 
the answer, wch smels of Babel and is wofully confused, its 
not allowed for such a one to hear, yet thers no law, cannon, 
statute prohibiting, surely where thers no law thers no trans- 
gression : but this is like the rest of their stuffe, they make 
laws as they list —

there came a letter to me out of Lane on Decemb 9 earnestly 
requiring my going over upon necessary busines, but it pleased 
god to prevent it, for my son Eliezer fel sick of a dangerous 
fever on the day after when I was preparing for a journey, and 
so confined a fourtnight weak, and it was a mercy I was not 
gone, for had I been at home when the letter came I had been 
gone : god hath much broken our harts with this sicknes and 
yet he hath not broken our family, many had given him up as 
gone, yet god did secretly bear up my heart in a chearful 
resigning him up to the lords dispose, and strong persuasions 
that god would return him to me again : one thing was re* 
markeable, on Saturday night just a weeke after he begun when 
several came to see him, and thought he would scarce liue til 
morning, I appointed munday following for a private fast upon 
his account, Mr Dawson and others promised to come, but it 
pleased god that before that day appointed came he was much 
better, and seemed to be wel towards recovery, thus god pre- 
vented us with his blessings of goodnes, and made good that 
promise isai 65 24 — before they cal I wii answer, and whiles 
they are yet speaking I wil hear : so god gaue us an occasion 
of thankfulnes upon the prefixed day of humiliation, lords day 
was a day of sweet inlargemt : and as we kept the munday as 
an incouraging fast,- so we kept friday following as an hart- 
refreshing day of thankfulnes for an almost compleat recovery, 
and since that he is throughly well : Upon the thuesday after 

I helpt to keep another day of thanksgiving at Denton for the 
wonderful providence of god for the liberty they haue yet con- 
tinued there of the publicke ordinances without disturbance, 
and oh what an hart-melting day was it, ceartainly it was a 
pledg of further mercy. 

I went on Saturday last to spend a sabboth at Bramhap with 
Mr Crosley and heard one Mr Ord a north country minister, 
that was lately in prison at York for preaching in a publick 
church in the city but was released at the three weeks end upon 
a flaw in the significavit, and it was a precious sabboth to me : 
the day after being the 30 of Jan, we tooke the advantage of 
a publick fast, a great congregation came from all parts, the 
lord helped me to cary on the work of the day (after Mr Cros- 
ley had made an expository beginning) with abundance of 
inlargement from 11a clock til halfe an houre past three — 
blessed, blessed be our gracious god for that precious and un- 
expected oppertunity i

upon Wednesday feb 9 65 1 went into Lane, and betwixt that 
and thuesday after I preacht 8 several times and for the most 
part in several places, tho in private, I must confesse I never 
knew such an actiue and unwearied spirit in people in al my 
observation, they were importunate for my poore pains, constant 
in their attendance and very numerous in their assembling, it 
did exceedingly affect my hart, and I laid out my selfe almost 
to the prejudice of my natural strength, every night was I 
imployed besides a fast, and the lords days worke, and I was 
the rather induced to it, partly because it is my natiue place, 
and amongst my natural relations, partly because their publick 
administrations are unprofitable and discouraging, and partly 
because I tooke this as a token for future good, and likewise 
because I knew not that ever I should appear amongst them 
again ; I knew not what the design of god might be in that 
unaccustomed boldnes, and unparaleld liberty : 

this day feb 20 I haue been at a day of thanksgiving, and 
there was abundant cause, god had visited a dear friend, and 
useful person in his place with sicknes, he got 4 to spend some 
time in prayer, and god gaue a sudden return, for that night 
he tooke good rest, and ever since hath recovered, and the 
same persons haue been spending this day in praise, it hath 
been a sweet day, a token for good, blessed be our prayer-hear- 
ing god : 

feb 28 (65) was appointed for a solemn day of preaching and 
administring the lords supper, in a worshipful gentlemans 
house, the persons he requested to preach were Mr Kerby and 
my selfe, the minister that consecrated the elemts was a stranger 
who was much caryed out in speaking largely to the communi- 
cants, before and after administration, we wer about 20 and 
sate about a table, one thing had impression upon me, he told 
us the disciples of cht after that ordinance were exposed both 
to greater sins and sufferings then ever before, well he illus- 
trated particularly, with his eyes fixed upon me, and his hand 
directly towards me, who sate over agt him, as if he meant me 
onely, the lord giue me the benefit of that ordinance, and help 
me to improue that passage : 

March 12 timely in the morning being lords day when I 
lookt out at doore and as I opened the gates there run a man 
away from thence, down the field, it was a servant to a chiefe 
adversary of mine, who had been standing just before the

gates, and walking about the house, as by his footsteps in the 
snow might be discerned, for it was a great snow that morning, 
what his end was I know not, but through gods rich providence 
we injoyd a blessed sabboth, and a greater company then 
usually before, because that day there was no preaching at 
Coley, and many of our neighbours spent the sabboth with us, 
to our abundant inlargement and satisfaction, without disturb- 
ance or distraction : Blessed be god : 

April 5 G5 was appointed by autority for a publick fast upon 
account of the Holland warre, wch I spent in the place of my 
birth, where was a very great number, and much inlargemt, 
and at night being requested I preacht upon that text job 34 
32 — upon occasion of the death of a mans onely child wher- 
with he was much affected, where also I had a great assembly, 
and on the lords day after I preacht three times, at my return, 
being alone upon Blakstone-edg I fel into serious meditation of 
the oppeitunitys I had injoyed in Lane, and in parting with it 
(not knowing when I may see it again) my heart was much 
affected and inlarged in longings and pantings for some good 
to soules by that journey : I wil wait to hear what god wil 
doe : 

April i 9 at night I had some company came to my house to 
hear the word of god, oh it was a sweet evening ! we were 
toga ther til 11 a clock the day after we heard that Sr John 
Aimitage snd his round to seek after conventicles that night 
he had the constable with him and came to my neighbour Capt 
Hodgsons, and tho he spake of coming hither yet god held 
him back : 

On April 23 I went and preacht at Peniston, god in his pro- 
vidence so ordering it, that tho I could not be quiet in my ex- 
cercises in mine owne house, yet it was an advantage to me 
and others more publickly, for I had a very great congregation 
and the lord helped graciously by his spirit, and gaue us safety 
and security by his watchful providence, oh blessed be his 
name for that sweet day of gospel liberty : 

the day after (saue one) I preacht at Bramhap, wch was a 
good day. After long consultations and intentions I deter- 
mined a journey into the south and observed a private fast 
to beg gods leaue and presence, he gaue us a sweet 
token for good, that day, and a satisfying return of prayer 
after so that in about G weekes time I dispatcht that

ham in Essex, London, Coventre, Lancash fulnesformy safe 
and elsewhere wch are worth a particular return — 
rehearsal : oh for a thankful heart ! 

it was generally reported that they had a warrant to appre- 
hend me at my returns home, and Sr John Armitage searchfc 
my house in my absence, in the dead of the night (as they pre- 
tended) for a conventicle, but I haue been now three weekes 
about home openly, and hear of no danger, blessed be god : 
yesterday being july 16 I spent the sabboth in mine owne 
house and found extraordinary inlargements in prayer and 
praise, but especially in wrestling with god for mercy in the 
forenoone for the nation, there was 11 or 12 besides my family, 
and oh what a flood of tearea was there in my house ! we were 
in safety without fear al day, tho since we hear that the con- 
stable and church-warden were met towards our house, but the 
lord strangely turned them another way : 
having a cal and intention to preach at Motram, and being 
disappointed that day by reason of other provision I helped 
my father Angier in that publick service at Denton, july 23 
who to the admiration of many yet injoys his publick liberty, 
on the thursday after we had a private fast at Denton hal, 
both wch times my soul was sweetly inlarged, blessed be god : 
Mr Bessick parson of Ratcliffe made bitter complaints agt 
me to some justices that I came over into Bolton parish, and 
gathered great companys to preach and pray to them, wch he 
called conventicles, but the justices put him off, he went on 
purpose another time to complain at a privy sessions, and Mr 
Hulton of Park a justice tolcfhim, he knew not what a conven- 
ticle meanes, that yt he informed agt was none, he sd he had 
heard that busines discus t at the councel table many times, 
and it was concluded negatiuely, and thus they gaue him a 
rebuke for his information 

and upon the Wednesday Aug 2d wch was appointed as a 
publick fast for the great plague in London we observed it 
privately though after a publick manner, in my fathers house, 
where my dear brother and I preacht and Mr Jones of Eccles 
prayed, we continued from 10 a clock to 6 in the evening, it 
was an excellent soul-melting day, and the day after we kept 
another fast at another place, people putting on to it and will-

and the abundant inlargemts we had, wch are a token for good : 
At my Return home I found a letter yt was come from 
Leeds to intreat my paines at Shadwel where Mr Hardcastle 
did preach who is now in prison for his publick work there, I 
willingly assented and went, and preacht there without dis- 
turbance the last lords day being Aug 13 the lord wonderfully 
helping and inlarging harts, the night before at Leeds there 
came tidings that the justices had been at the Bailifs house 
and that the bailiffs had a particular charge and resolution to 
goe to Shadwel that lords day, and surprize us, some dissuaded, 
but through mercy I kept my purpose and the lord directed 
their course another way, to bring in a meeting of quakers 
most of whom they haue imprisoned : 

the day after at Leeds many good people met togather in 
private where I preacht to them, prayed with them, oh what 
more then ordinary hart-meltings w T as there at that time, 
blessed be god : 

yesterday being Aug 19 the pursevants took up several per- 
sons at and about Halifax Dr Mawd, Capt Hodgson, Mr Root 
junr, Nat Shrigley : John Lum ; — and are taking up others to 
day to cary them to York before the Duke, upon what accont 
tis not known several were afraid of me : but blessed be god 
w T e haue injoyed this lords day peacebly and profitably without 
disturbance and a considerable number of people : 
An 1G65] On Aug 24 being Bartholomew day the killing 
day for al the nonconformist ministers I appointed 
a fast at my house, I had the help of several good Christians, 
where I propounded 4 things 1 to lament before the lord this 
sad judgmt, 2 to inquire of god the cause of it 
[hopes frus- the sins provoking to it 3 to beg of god the 
trated as its sanctifyed use of this dreadful stroke, 4 to in- 
fit — treat god to remoue it — I hope god wil answer 

before that day shal come again — god graunt : 
on Sept 17 being lords day which I spent in private as I was 
wont in the fore-noon when I was at prayer there came to my 
house Joshua Whittley, the Constable, and too other men to 
surprize us, they disturbed us, and though they would shew me 
no order yet they came furiously in, searcht the house (and as 
it pleased the lord to order it at that time, much different from 
other times) they found but four persons besides my family

of it the lord onely knows — they left us and we spent the rest 
of the day comfortably — blessed be god 

I was sent for to Wakefield to keep a private fast there on 
Wednesday octob 11th with Mr Wales and some other ministers 
on the behalfe of Nathan Dodgson a young man whom they 
judged to be possessed or bewitched, he was indeed strangely 
taken, especially at prayer, six or seven lusty men could scarce 
hold him, but he was lift up off the bed with incredible 
violence, he had abundance of fits that day, had all his senses 
taken from him, was as stiffe as a stone, did sing in his fits, the 
lord helped his servants to pray feelingly with compassionate 
hearts, and god heard prayers, for from Wednesday til munday 
that I came away he had no such violent fits, onely when we 
went to prayer he was ordinarily cast into a kind of slumber, 
and was not sensible, he often sees an apparition like a woman, 
and those that are with him, hear a terrible noyse, but see 
nothing : I hope god wil doe him good by this providence, 

I left him in a very sensible melting frame : 

I kept the sabboth (upon a call) at flansil hall, and at night 
preacht at Mr Kerbys house in his pulpit, where I had a large 
congregation, a good day &amp; night, blessed be my good god : 

Yesterday being octob 17 we kept a fast at Mr Dawsons 
house, and tho I was very unprepared yet it was a sweet melting 
heart-inlarging day to me : 

Novemb 5 1665 I preacht at Peniston and on the Wednesday 
after kept the monethly fast for the plague in London notice 
was brought into the church yt some troopers were waiting at 
the church-gates to apprehend me, but I was guided a back 
way to my lodging at Water-hall, they pretended to come about 
a briefe to the churchwardens, and whether their intention 
was to take me I am not yet ceartain, but there came a naughty 
Bailiffe with them who hues near Sr Thomas Wentworth, who 
had often threatened to send a party of horse to surprise them 
at Peniston, yet I stayed and preached a 
funeral sermon there upon friday for Mr [the fast follow- 
Wadsw orths mother, returned home that ing I preacht at 
day, and kept the Sabboth at my own house Denton viz Decern 
next following, and preacht three times to 6 1665 
a considerable company without any inter- 
ruption. Blessed be god : 



200 Autobiography . 

in Christmas week within the compasse of 8 days I kept 
three fasts and preacht nine several times, I haue not at any 
time ordinarily found my heart in so settled a frame of tender- 
nes and inlargednes in duty, yesterday exceeded, and now this 
morning, (being new-yeares-day) came Nathan Whitley and my 
Landlord to giue me notice to remoue, at May-day next, a sad 
omen of many troubles in this ensuing year the Lord prepare 
me for them : 

On the 8th of January I preacht (upon a call) at Shadwel, 
where Mr Hardcastle was taken a second time and caryed 
prisoner to York, the Lord sent in a numerous and affectionate 
audience, in the morning I was speaking of the Bailiffs coming 
that day, I warrant you, said another, theyl come none to day, 
but whiles I was in my forenoones excercise they came, one 
Newzam a Leeds Bailiffe was the man, and another with him, 
he lookt in at the window at me, (tho I 
observed him not) and said, I haue nothing 
to doe with this man, onely he made great 
inquiry for my name, and desired several 
to step to the pulpit and bring it, and he 
would be gone, but they al refused, when 
I had done, hearing the bailiffs were there 
I went on to the afternoones work and 
begun to sing, and they quite left us, say- 
ing weel leaue them merry, and we in joyed 
ful liberty al that day, keeping togather 
without intermission till about 8 a clock, 
wch was an advantage to all our spirits and a convenience for 
many that had far home — providence ordered al to the best, 
and we had a sweet day, blessed be our good god : 

that night I repeated at Shadwel to a considerable company, 
on the munday night, and thuesday at night I preacht at 
Leeds, on Wednesday night at Bramley, where god sent in many 
to hear me, and gaue us many sweet inlargemts : 

on thursday when I came home one had come, and watcht at 
my house 4 houres to speak with me, and desire my preaching 
at Peniston on Lords day sennight — the day being come I went 
and preacht there on Lords day being Jan 21 1665-0 where 
the Lord gaue us a good day without disturbance, a great 
assembly, some grounds of hope, blessed be god : 

Being sent for into Lane I went, and baptized a child, kept

three days togather in private, and then preacht on the Lords 
day at Denton, and on the fast spent near fiue houres in pub- 
lick, being feb 7 1665—6, my father Angier prayed, but had not 
time to preach : it was a precious day, and I hope god will 
return an answer of prayer in due time : 

My landlord T Oates standing resolutely upon it that I must 
remoue, and taking possession on Candlemas day, because I had 
laid out money was whiling to put it to reference, foure men 
were chosen, met yesterday, but could make 
no end, there being at least four pound betwixt [feb 14 1665-6 
them, but this day he coming to my house 
w r ith several other neighbours, v r e dispatcht it presently in halfe 
an houre and he giues me 5li and I am to quit his farme quietly. 
Blessed be god that so good and peaceble an end is made with- 
out suits and contentions v r hich I was councelled to, and my 
cause w’as clear, but my spirit is wholly opposite to such violent 
ways — subscribing to that maxime si vis esse quietus perde 
aliquid : 

I went to preach at Peniston again, and once more in joyed a 
comfortable sabboth in publick, March 4 1665-6 and though 
Sr Thom. Wentworth had threatened to apprehend me, yet I 
kept the monethly fast on the Wednesday after, w r ch was a sw T eet 
day. Blessed be our good god : 

this day March 24 65-6 is a day of great scattering, hun- 
dreds of ministers being by act of Pari banished fiue miles from 
the places where they haue formerly preacht, if they take not 
an oath, which they generally refuse, and this day I come out 
of Yorkshire to Denton to liue in exile. 0 the teares that haue 
been shed for breaking familys, and separating husbands, wiues, 
parents and children, pastors and people ! the lord look upon it 
and requite it : 

after six weekes wandring abroad to visit [Removed April 
friends I am once at last arrived at mine owne 30 1666 
house, may 3 in the night, I find my family 
removed, but I hope for the better, to a better house at Coley 
hall* yet without land, w r ch as times shape, may proue still, very 
much for the better, lesse labour and danger, trouble and hazard : 

this day being May the 8 I w-as left alone in my new house, 
and I see god is to be found in all places for my soul hath had 
wonderful meltings and sweet inlargements in confessing sin, 
and in wrestling with god upon my face a good while togather,

f ruct as, ossaq : croston habet 

he told me he writ it in the window with a diamond set in a 
gold ring, when he came to the last word the diamond fell out, 
and he had much adoe to write habet with it, as I evidently 
saw, wch occasioned in him a strong apprehension that possibly 
he might lay his bones there but with great difficulty : wch since 
hath proved so, for after 37 yeares ministry there, he was 1 
cast out by the act of uniformity : 2 he had taken an house in 
Manchester to liue there, 3 he fel sick as he travelled to 
Preston, and there he dyed, and after very much adoe his 
parishioners prevailed for his interring at Croston, 4 great 
danger was made by the present incumbent about a sermon 
and consequently his funeral, for al sides were peremptory, and 
the debate lasted long, they resolving to read common-prayer 
over him, his wife utterly refusing, and god moved Dr Wallery 
and Mr Pilkington to take their horses and ride their ways, and 
let them doe as they pleased, and so Mr Welch an honest non- 
conformist preached his funeral sermon — 
he had been 52 yeares minister — 

God hath given in from desperate dangers the life of my son 
Eliezer at these times. 

1 when he was but about a quarter old at Denton he was in 
a grievous torment of hideous shriek for almost too houres, and 
by the help of a white candle instead of a clister was helped to 
a stoole and recovered, 

2 when beginning in the poxe, he fel into a fit like a convul- 
sion, wherin we al thought for halfe an houre there had been 
no life in him, but his body looking like a dead corpse at last 
he revived 

3 in a journey out of Lancashire, I had him before me, the 
horse fel forward, and lay upon me, and I upon the child, and 
for a fit none of us could moue, or help ourselues yet none of 
us hurt, blessed be god :

child being under with his face to the grond, his breath almost 
gone when some men came to help him, 

5 by mine owne house a great heavy yate that was loose fel 
upon both my sons, John got wrestled from under, Eliezer lay 
there while john called us in the house, in that time he grew 
black in the face, and was almost gone : 

6 he fel downe the stares from the top to the bottome, with 
his head and face forwards in wch time I made accont to haue 
taken him up dead, or some of his bones broken, yet not hurt 
— this was august 10 1661 

7 the great middle post of the barne doores being reared to 
aside he touching it, it fel upon him, and though it struck him 
doune and might haue killed him yet it fel onely upon the side 
of his foot and crusht his ancle, wch was shortly wel agen — 

8 the last week octob 1 1664 he fel dangerously sick at 
school and was sent home on horseback he cast much, burnt 
exceedingly, cryed out of extremity of pain in his head and 
belly, we made ful accont of a feaver, I sent his water to Dr 
Mawd who not being at home, he had nothing but recovered 
by gods immediat providence within three or four days — 
blessed be god — 

9 but on Decemb 9 64 he fel dangerously sick of a burning 
feaver, was grievously pained and moaned sadly several days, 
was very costive in his body, much pained al over we gaue him 
too clisters according to the Doctors direction, wch wrought 
not according to expectation, few yt saw him thought he would 
recover, but it hath pleased the lord to restore him — blessed be 
our good god : 

10 I haue a letter from my son Eliezer this night wch is 
Nov 21 1673 — dated Nov 13 from Dusthorp in Warwickshire 
(where he and his brother are trained up with Mr Hickman in 
university-learning, in wch letter he acquaints me that the 
week before as he was going up stairs his foot slipt, and he fell 
from the top to the bottom, and hurt his back, being not able 
to goe streight of 2 or 3 days, but now, sth he blessed be god 
it is pretty well : 

11 Upon their return home I find that my son Eliezer hath 
had 3 great dangers in Westmorland one was a fall doun a pair 
of staires in Kendal the circumstances of it are remarkeable —

stone, he was under water could not recover himself, but his

13 another time he was riding upon the sands was to ride 
through a lake where was a dangerous bog, the horses feet 
begun to sink he wheeld back, brought him out, if he had 
gone on he had been drouned, — but god secured 

14 he was dangerously distempered in Scotland god recovered, 
brought them home Apr 18 1677 . 

On June 9 1666 being a Saturday when my maid was gone 
to Halifax market, and my too sons and I kept the house, in 
the chamber I set them both a praying and then I went to 
prayer my selfe, my son John kneeled by me, and wept very 
sore, when I had done I asked him whether he understood me, 
he said yes, then I fel a discoursing with them about the state 
of their soules, we all three wept sore, they were much affected 
with their state by nature, &amp;c it was a melting season, who 
knows but some buddings may appear afterwards, they that 
sow in teares shal reap in joy — oh how many teares haue been 
shed for them, they are dedicated to the lord, oh for a little 
grace for their poore soules. 

If I speak the language of my heart I haue observed these 

experiments in my ministry : 

1 My great design hath been, in the course of my ministry, 
and first undertaking it to bring soules home to god by conver- 
sion, and the lord hath made me abundantly and unexpectedly 
succesful therin, I think I haue been more useful for bringing 
in to christ then building up in him : 

2 I haue much bent my selfe to speak particularly and in a 
distinguishing maner to al both in prayer and preaching, that 
some word might always be spoken to every ones condition, 
and not without some good successe, it pitys me any should 
goe without their portion, 

3 I would carefully distinguish betwixt the worke of my 
office as a minister and the dutys of religion as a Christian, 
my corrupt hart is apt to let the latter fal by occasion of the 
practice of the former, I find it easier to practice the dutys of 
both in formality then either of them to purpose and throughly. 

4 I desire to doe what I doe in the ministry with all my 
heart and might, at home as wel as abroad to a slender company 
as wel as to a great congregation, I would not procure a curse 
by doing gods worke negligently, if I preach but to one soule 
it deserues my utmost endeavour, I dare not offer to the lord 
that wch costs me nothing, 



206 



Memoranda. 



5 I haue been much afraid of doing any thing wch might 
directly or indirectly strengthen the hands of the wicked, or 
sadden the harts of the godly, wch sometimes I am notwith- 
standing forced to doe agt my wil, at least accidentally, 
my worke is to pul downe the devils kingdome and build up 
chts, and 

6 tho I haue had many "temptations and inclinations yet I 
know not that I haue had ordinarily any strong prevalency 
therof or resolution to man-pleasing, it griues me that any 
should be offended with me. Yet I would rather al the men 
in the world were agt me, then god and mine oune conscience 
to be mine enemys — 

7 my desire as wel as mine inclination is to keep an equal 
mediocrity betwixt rigidnes and too much carnal compliance, 
tho I be rather inclined to the latter, and urge my selfe to the 
former in some cases. I find much want of prudence and dis- 
cretion how to carry as I ought, on this behalfe lest I run into 
extremes. 

8 When I begun first im my profession of Christianity and 
function of the ministry my charity was farre narrower and my 
forbearance shorter then I see it must be upon further experi- 
ence, for if I judg al obstinate that haue sinned foully, and al 
unregenerate that cannot evidence it to me I may offend god 
and wrong them, I would rather offend by too much chari table- 
nes then censoriousnes. 

9 I find as much gracious tendernes and useful gifts in those 
humble Christians that haue hid themselues and haue been loath 
to shew themselues, as in many others that haue been famous 
and accounted as pillars, tis a useful thing for a minister to put 
his people upon service, and giue occasion for the excercise of 
secret graces, and discovery of concealed worth — 

10 I find Christians of different tempers, some apt to run 
into one extreme others into another. I find it very hard to 
suit every condition, so as to giue every one their grain of 
allowance and yet indulge them in no sin, to curb their frow- 
ardnes so as not to nip the buddings of grace, and prevent the 
sproutings of what is good in their harts and hues. 

Ill cannot satisfy mine owne conscience about others com- 
mission of sin, that I may not appropriate the guilt therof to 
my selfe, but keep my selfe pure. 1 know he that seeth another 
commit a sin and useth not utmost meanes to hinder it com- 



Memoranda . 



207 



municates in the guilt therof, and I am very doubtful whether 
publick warning be sufficient I had need haue no more sins to 
answer for then those I personally commit nor those neither. 

12 I am apt to resolue hastily and precipitantly upon some 
things in judgment and practice well I see cause afterwards to 
retract and undertake what I am not able to grapple with, and 
therby bring my selfe into snares, either to goe on in a way 
agt conscience, or equity upon experience or make a shameful 
retreat, and I find so much stout lies and selfishnes that as the 
former is a wrong to my soul so the latter to my repute and I 
can scarce obtain that ingenuity and victory over my selfe, but 
by the help of special grace. 

13 When I haue purposely studyed to shew my selfe in wit 
or parts, learning or reading I neither please my selfe nor pro- 
fit others, but am exceedingly baffled, and doe discernably 
faulter when I would doe better then my selfe in publick I doe 
worse, but when I lay aside mine owne spirit, and haue least 
confidence in my parts or preparations then the lord helps 
most. When I am weak then am I strong — 

14 I haue many times had most freedome of speech when 
my hart hath been very little affected, and my spirit hath been 
much inlarged when I haue not had vent for it, sighs and 
groanes unutterable. I find it a different thing to haue words 
at wil and to haue a hart in frame, tho usually if the lord help 
me with an affected hart, he helps me with fit and fluent ex- 
pressions. 

15 those labours I haue made most account of haue been 
most succesles, those I haue made least account of haue been 
most effectual for doing good a great sinner was wrought upon 
at a mariage-sermon, when many a sermon that 1 haue 
thought in studying surely this wil pierce and wound, hath 
returned empty as to saving operation, gods thoughts are not 
as ours, nor wil he be limited by us. 

16 1 find it an easier matter to goe through the more publick 
and general workes of my work then private, yea to be faithful 
in some measure in the former rather then the latter, 1 can 
better charge sin home and speak more feelingly and sensibly 
wherin many may be concerned, then bring things home to 
particular soules in discourse, personal dealing 1 find hard 
to undertake. 

17 what parts of humane excellency I haue affected to set

Memoranda. 



off my sermons with therin I haue been most defeetiue, and 
am usually most helped even therin when I least seek for such 
notions, as rhetorical flourishes, scripture allusions, natural or 
moral resemblances, historical passages, philosophical problemes, 
human adages — I can least bring them of when I most mind 
them, and they come off best when not so much regarding 
them, I learn by degrees to omit them : 

18 I find it an easier matter to be imployed in the most 
difficult studys in humane literature then to study mine oune 
hart, I can more freely buckle to the hardest part of my publick 
work in private then with any measure of cheafulnes set on per- 
sonal worke of meditation, selfe-examination, secret prayer &amp;c 

19 I can say through grace I am not afraid of the sabboth 
day, but on the contrary welcome it with the greatest compla- 
cency, tho it is the most toylsome day in the week as to my 
outward labour yet it hath been many a time the most refresh- 
ing to my spirit, yea I should not haue knowne how to past on 
my life had it not been for lords-day inlargements, my one 
days rest makes amends for my other tovl, my inward quiet is 
usually more then outward labour on that day 

20 I can say by the help of divine grace that tho I desire 
aboue al things in the world to be useful in my place, yet I 
would not monopolize it to my selfe, but desire others might 
be sharers in doing gods work with as much successe, nay I 
haue desired god might haue glory and his work might goe 
forward whoever be the instruments aud can as heartily rejoyce 
when gods kingdome is propagated tho by others as much as if 
it were by my selfe — 

And now when by publick act I am taken off my work I can 
say through grace, 1 that I could not onely be content but 
heartily glad if gods work may be effectually done by others 
tho he should lay me aside as an useles vessel 

2 that its more trouble to my spirit to want or be deprived 
of oppertunity to doe my god service then to want any outward 
advantages of maintenance &amp;c by my worke — 

3 that I doe not abate of my paines in studying any more 
now then when I was imployed in publick, but haue studyed 
and spoken as many sermons besides other more constant 
studys — 

4 the lords days wherin I keep house whether I haue lesse 
company or more my body is as weary and brest sore with pains

as when I am excercised in publick, fcho I haue a recompense 
in the refreshmt of my spirit. 

Special seasons wherin my heart was abundantly melted and 

inlarged, 

Tho my heart be usually and ordinarily in a dul dead and 
frozen frame, yet thers scarce a place or roome where I haue 
any time resided but as it hath been witnesse to my corruptions 
breaking out, so to the strong and gracious impressions upon, 
and waking motions of my hart heaven wards — yet these par- 
ticularly are most observable. 

1 At Cambridge, the first yeare when I was newly separated 
from my friends, my bowels yearned with some natural affec- 
tions, and I desired to take that advantage to turne them into 
a better chanel : then the lord helped me wonderfully in the 
excercise of repentance, — 

2 in Yorkeshire when I begun to buckle on the great worke 
of the ministry, I knew not whether I was fit for it, and was 
afraid of rashnes, and missing my way, and running before I 
was sent withal considering the insupportable burden to be laid 
upon me — 

3 once when I was in loue with a godly yong woman upon 
whom my hart was too eagerly set, it cost me many a bitter 
pang wch I desired to improue for higher ends and more 
spiritual designes, and I am answered much to the better in 
that kind : 

4 in a journey betwixt London and Lancashire where being 
al alone I saw some thieues hanging near the road, wch mightily 
broke my hart, and upon such meditations as the lord helpt me 
to on that occasion my hart was so affected as it never was in 
al my life that I remember. 

5 when I was prisoner, taken by some souldiers to Brig- 
house, where I was al night, and in the morning in the chamber 
where I had lyen having read a scripture, and buckling to 
meditation, the souldiers in the house below me swearing and 
prophanlv talking my hart was much inlarged, especially 
reflecting on my present condition

and was come home upon the friday after june 7. 1 was for

and for benefit by the affliction and in humiliation upon my

knees, that I think I may say through rich grace that exceeded 
any other time before mentioned, if I mistake not. 

7 in the same place july 26 my hart was deeply sensible of 
my back slidings from god and from that liuely frame he had 
begot in me by afflictions and by his ordinance of the supper 
the sabboth before and I solemnely renewed my vows of a more 
strict walking with god for the future — 

8 October the 5th being Saturday and taking the advantage 
of my maid and childrens absence, in my study for a while my 
hart was in a very warme and melting frame in prayer for the 
church, for the congregation, with respect to my present condi- 
tion, and for my worke and subject the day following, oh it 
was a sweet fit and season : 

9 April 9 1662 sequestring part of it for secret soul-humili- 
ation for three or four houres in the forenoone wch the lord 
helped me to spend alone about divers occasions wch I writ 
downe and had in mine eye, the lord wonderfully inlarged my 
hart in prayer and meditation, and sensibly sealed me up by 
his spirit — 

10 june 28 having the oppertunity of secrecy by being sole 
house-keeper, having settled and stirred up my thoughts in 
meditation to the duty of prayer, the lord was mightily with 
me, and being much dejected in spirit I lay prostrate on the 
floore a considerable time, with sighs and grones, indeed, truely 
unutterable — blessed be my good god — 

11 upon the lords day Aug 2 1663 being warned not to goe 
to Halifax church for excommunicate I kept house al day with 
my too sons and servant maid, upon wch my soul in joyed a 
sweet rest in the lord, such a day as I injoyed not in private 
this many a day, I see god takes in when men thrust out, and 
tho our house was watch t, and Sr John troop beset other houses 
yet we were quiet : 

this I may say of lords days many times since and little doe 
men know the courtesy they haue done me in this thing — 

I would be freely at the lords dispose and desire not to limit 

the holy one of Israel, but if it were the wil of the lord I 

desire now to be dissolved upon these following grounds,

1 that I might compleatly and constantly injoy the lord my

2 that I might dishonour my god no more by sinning, griev- 
ing gods spirit reflects back griefs to my soul, yet to this griefe 
am I under a fatal necessity by reason of my original depravity, 
and nothing but the pangs of death wil break these bonds. 

3 that I might not be led into or lost in the temptations of 
the times, snares are a laying clouds arising, and I suspect mine 
owne strength tho I would not distrust gods, and I am afraid 
of being a scandal to religion, and griefe to the godly by sinful 
complyance. 

4 that I might liue no longer then to work for god, the sus- 
pending of non-conformists is aimed at, and I would not be 
laid aside as a useles log, I would not haue my master find me 
idle either through my sinful default or imposed necessity. 

5 that while I worke I might be succesful I haue not found 
of late that fruit of my endeavours as formerly, and if it were 
gods wil I desire not to be sent upon an hardening worke, but 
rather to be removed then doe no good — 

6 that I might not surviue my liuely impressions under my 
late pressing afflictions, I blesse the lord I never in joyed so 
much of god, or had for so long a time such a melting frame of 
hart as I haue had since my dear wiues death, I would not liue 
to loose it. 

7 that I might in joy the sweet society of glorifyed saints in 
heaven the spirits of the just made perfect al the army of patri- 
archs, prophets, apostles, martyrs, ministers, Christians of al 
rankes, in particular those of my precious relations that dyed in

My soules a hunted roe, my life’s in doubt 
afflicting troubles compasse me about, 
as hunted roe in mountaines am I chast 
with fighting, fleeing am I sore amaz’d : 

Woe to thee, o my soul, my body, all, 
if mortal enemys doe cause thee to fall, 

What shal I doe or whither shal I goe ? 

to scape these dangers, and prevent this woe ? 
hide wel thy selfe, when troubles thee assayle, 
unles thou hide with god, they wil prevaile : 

On one hand satan with soul-catching art, 
tempts, troubles, tickles, and then makes me smart, 
with open force, with secret fraud attempts, 
to draw my soul to sin, and so torments, 
my life doth stand in danger every howre 
since mortal mighty foes would me devoure, 
what shal I doe, or whither shal I run ? 

resist I cannot long, my strength is done 
gods name’s a tower whither soules doe flee, 
by faith and prayer I’le hide my selfe wth thee : 

The world comes next, and proues a deadly foe, 
tho smiling oft yet in the end its woe, 
her pleasures profits and her honours are, 
as guilded baits, her beautys daintys rare, 
her syren songs are al bewitching charmes, 
her sweet embraces end in deadly harmes, 
how shal I scape these straits, and break these snares 
to free my hart from feares, my mind from cares, 
god is my anchor, center, there I’le hide, 
my trembling soul, his promise is my guide : 

Its frownes oth tother hand, and blustering stormes 
its tumbling waues come roaring with alarmes,

threaten my downfal from their lion’s den,

the worlds a prison, and tormenting rack,

how shal I be freed from these mortal feares 
I’le hid my selfe with god by prayers and teares 

Let wicked rebels run away from god 
like guilty Adam from the common road 
of humane observation and goe downe,

like hunted roe hide thee from these hel hounds

Then o my soul thourt hid, and onely then 
from angry god, and from malicious men, 
when others subterfugiums are remov’d 
when naked soules are set to be reprov’d 
by th righteous judg, then sitting on his throne 
seeking a shelter with despairing groane : 
oh then a rest in chts beloved brest

tho al men seek their owne, and none doth care, 
for publick good, yet most men could prepare 
for future state, and hide their treasure sure, 
where moth nor thiefe can hurt, and wil endure, 
Alas what treasures can we haue below ? 

what barren crop of that we richly sow ! 

Nay life s a vapour, richest pearles but drosse,

EXPERIMENTAL AS TO OTHERS. 

Tho god take not his loving kindnes from his servants and 
their seed yet they are often punished by their children in the 
same kind wherin themselues were an affliction to their parents, 
as one that had a bastard before he was marryed, so had his 
son, tho god gaue repentance to both savingly : J B 

persons of good repute for civil honesty haue been left by 
god to staine and shame themselues by one act of wickednes, in 
some he makes use therof for humbling their harts in order to 
their conversion and salvation, in others onely for terrour and 
amazement, and these adde more sins to their prophanes then 
could haue been imagined to haue been in them, and usually 
grow harder and fill up the measure : H S 

tis dangerous to deferre the doing of that wch is resolved 
upon for want of a perfect oppertunity and ful juncture of al 
conveniencys, usually the providence of god casts in new and 
unexpected occasions to intervene, and in a godly cause deferring 
mariage upon slight grounds were glad to doe it when inevitable 
cause of trouble to themselues and offence to others threatened 
to interest, W H 

the devils kingdome is many times hindred by that wch he 
mainly aimes for the upholding therof and demolishing of chts, 
god overtops, outwits, and undermines satan at his owne game, 
tho satan opposeth us in this congregation yet it more tends to 
union, discovery, and edification of Christians as a godly minis- 
ter being silenced at home was intent to spread the gospel by 
travelling through and preaching to very ignorant countrys and 
congregations — in W 

Wilful wast wil haue a woeful want, prodigality brings 
penury and misery, riches got with basenes and covetousness

and march spent al that was left him viz 400 li and run into 
Ireland and there was miserably lost, his company while he had 
money sate bare at paying -of the reckoning and called him 
master, but miserably deserted him in extremity — J S 

they that oppose truth meet with oppositions and contradic- 
tion among themselves, error is as different from it selfe as 
from truth, and they that run from god and his ways for fear 
of trouble meet with a great deal more in sinful paths, some say

the devils kingdom is divided and shews itself to be a yery 
babel, and near a fal — 0 T 

Such is the deceit of our harts that we are apt to plead much 
for that wch when it comes to practice we oppose with al our 
might, once pleading mightily for loue, union, and condescen- 
tion among Christians, and as a help to it, plain hartednes, 
faithfulnes in discharge of duty, taking things in best sense, 
bewrayed abundance of pride and passion in wresting made 
contrary to intention before the discourse was ended J L 

plain, upright-harted, close walking Christians know much of 
gods mind, especially such as are much with god in secret 
serious prayer, an ancient Christian woman told me that god 
had acquainted her with divers particular passages before 
brought to passe wch she made known to some Christians, and 
concerning this nation she told me that she had a special satis- 
fying impression, that a dark and sad cloud would come over 
this nation but it would be but short tho very sharp storme — 
then god would open the cloud, and discover his power and 
loue, — and settle the nation and church in a comfortable posture, 
and there continue his presence a long time it may be til the 
great day of judgmt — ther should be mighty workes accom- 
plished whoever liued to see it — K K 

As persons liue so usually they dye, and the more wit and 
learning they haue the more dangerous and desperate is their 
condition, for such are hardened in their sins, and conceited of 
themselues, an old man living wretchedly and wickedly, gaue 
himself e to verses, storys, jests and witty inventions, made a 
jest of the things of god, scarce ever read chapter in the bible, 
found great fault with the prophets and apostles, made nothing 
of their writings in comparison of the 4 evangelists, yet being 
confident of his salvation, made nothing of death, but a 3 
houres worke, affirming he long had the white stone, yet con- 
tinuing in very idle atheistical discourse til towards his end, 4 
or 5 days before his end he sd a little curre lay at his pillow 
always barking, and a lusty black man with a cloak, and jing- 
ling spurs came and would needs lye with him recited for him

fled into Ireland, left an ill savor behind him where he was, had 
sollicited and obtained a yong womans affections without parents

Covetousnes and hankring after the world is a sore evil, and 
attended with many Crosses and sins in them and to them, tho 
its dangerous to make misinterpretations of gods dispensations, 
yet this was a heavy judgmt and accident — in Bolton parish the 
whole family went on a lords day to publick assembly, leaving 
a maid servant, and a youth of 10 years of age within who were 
both barbarously murdered and the house robbed the woman as 
was thought contended with them, wherby she received many 
grievous blows, was fearfully wounded, and speedily and surely 
killed, and dragged out in an inhumane and uncivil manner,

about 9 or ten a clock in the morning, and not found til night,

They that goe out of their places and interpose beyond their 
bonds to driue away and lay aside others are themselues laid 
aside in time. The case and state of our oune nation sufficiently 
evidenceth this. What changings haue we seen in a little time, 
the army came forcibly and dissolved the parliament in 1648 
and set a number to sit, who like jehu driue on furiously, and 
then was overturned in 1658 — then ruled 01 Cromwel with 
great pomp and majesty til he dyed, and his successor and son 
Rich was deposed in 1659 and trampled upon with al his allys 
and creatures with the greatest ignominy and disgrace — tho god 
retaliates and giues to men as they haue dealt with others, — 
god is holy in al his ways and righteous in al his Avorkes — his

was matter of great fear and astonishmt to us, since they were 
but a handful agt a whole nation, being disappointed by their 
confederates elsewhere, I confesse I was always dissatisfyed with 
the manner of their rising and thought they would not prosper, 
wch came to passe for on aug 19 they were fearfully routed, tho 
not so many slain as the report came first. Yet the whole 
country brought thereby into great extremitys, suspicions and 
oppressions ; On Aug 6 and 7 my wife was in great pangs of 
travel, and was near giving up the ghost, tho god brought 
through at last yet the child was very little, and troubled with 
many infirmitys and after some fears and hopes we had, it sen-

ship, and saw what advantage they had got agt me in respect 
of state affaires. I resolved to quit this place and to leaue,

while more then ordinary wickednes, great drinking, swearing, 
sabboth-breaking, whoredomes, robberys, games, horseraces, 
dancing revelling, and contempt of the gospel, that I confesse 
I feared a sad hand of god would fal upon them, and now they 
are likely to endure the brunt and sharpnes of it, and be 
almost undone in their estates, the good lord sanctify it to 
their harts, 

its an easier matter to be imployed about any thing tho 
never so difficult then hartwork, I find I can buckle upon 
the hardest studys more easily then search mine owne hart 
throughly and to purpose — 

I see when persons presumptuously boast of their strength 
and get the upper hand and trample down others thats a clear 
presage of their declining state, pride goes before a fal in 
persons and people — 

We are very apt to run into extremes either we goe on in an 
usurpation or tyranoy, sectarys one while old Royalists another, 
an opposition to a king, or an absolute arbitrary irregular 
monarchy exprest —

.Iliitrtr.’ 

I confess the day of our parting from our dear flocks and 
familys is a sad day, March 24, ’65 66 but I hope it may be for 
some good. I hear of mighty workings of affections upon ac- 
count of the separation 

1 my first stage was from my own house to Halifax, and con- 
sidering the many friends I took leave off, it was a considerable 
days- work, it melted our hearts having been aboue 15 years to- 
gether, and many endearments betwixt me and my dear people. 

2 day I came to Denton, it was the weariest, most tedious 
journey that I haue had that way wch I had gone many hun- 
dred times, but scarce ever with so sad a heart in so sharp a 
storm of weather. At Denton I spent the Lords’ day, an 
honest man preacht, did good I hope, blessed be god. 

3 my father Angier having ventured to tarry at home til 
munday, I being to travel with him we set forth that day, 
March 26, and went to Mr. Hides of Norbury, and were there 
too nights, and there I hope did good, himself being infirm, 
and his sister dumb and lame, we prayed, and met with god. 

4 on Wednesday we travelled togather to Sr Thomas Stan- 
leys of Auderley, where I being called to goe to prayer in that 
large family the first night we came, I had a temptation to 
study and speak handsome words with respect to the company, 
but reflecting, to whom I prayed, and that it was no trifling 
matter I set myself in serious earnest to the work and god 
helpt me to speak to him seriously with respect to the state of 
their soules and the good of the family. 

5 tho Sr Thomas was very earnest with us to stay yet my 
father was willing to giue a visit to his wiues aunt, my grand- 
mother Mosleys sister, thence we went to Mobberly 3 miles, 
she having let her house, and reserving but too rooms for her 
selfe, sent us out to lodge at another house, travellers must be 
prepared for all conditions, there I had not a roome to pray in, 
but walking into the garden met with a good house of office, 
where I fel on my knees, and I met with my god and he melted 
my heart graciously, blessed be god : 

upon friday march 30 we went to Mr. Leas house of Darnel, 
a gentleman of good rank, who marryed Mr. Venables daughter 
where indeed we were very nobly treated and entertained, 
spent the lords day at Over, where we heard one Mr. Hall a 
conformist.

aboue 2 or 3 rood from the house I met them, the one was 
fallen, the other lifting to get him up, my horse was frighted 
and would not goe by at last having got him up, he reached 
towards me, and said he would see who I was, but the other 
held him off, and bade, let him alone, come by friend, so I 
went by, what would they have done if they had known it had 
been I ? but god hid me from them, for I had not mine owne 
horse, and I had a gray coat, and did not speak for they would 
have known my voyce — blessed be the keeper of Israel, who 
preserveth my going out and my coming in to this day

and so came home to mine owne house on the day after being 
friday, April 12 1667 

As I came homewards all alone upon Blackstone edge, set- 
ting my self seriously to meditate I had strange impressions 
set upon my spirit concerning death and tho I be now think- 
ing of a change of my condition, and tho it be abundantly to 
my satisfaction yet 1 had then strange and strong motions 
rather to be dissolved and goe to Cht, I turned upon the edge, 
looked over Lancashire, and seemed to take an everlasting 
farewel of Lane, and upon a deep sense of the vanity of worldly 
comforts, and the disappointment therin I was indifferent 
whether ever I should see that place again where my dearest 
friend liues, and could rather have desired to be with my 
spiritual husband — oh it was a sweet season, seldome is my 
heart in such a frame as then it was, I hope god did it either 
to fit me for death or render this new condition and expected 
relation more profitable : 

On Lords day I preacht in mine owne house, and because 
there was no body at Coley chappel in the afternoone I had 
the more in my house, which tho it be very capacious was wel 
filled, with strangers and neighbours, and indeed tis the 
admiration of all that there such eompanys meeting and no 
notice taken therof, blessed be god for our protection.

This day being July 31 1671 having the oppertunity of 
solitarines, all my family being from home, having set my self 
solemly to the work of god and my oun soule, first reading the 
139 psalm concerning gods omniscience and omnipresence, 
with teares in mine eyes, commenting upon it, applying it to 
my self, accordingly setting my self in the presence of god, 
desiring to deale truely and faithfully with my oun soul in self- 
examination, to rip open all the sins I know of, I fell doun 
upon my knees, and for about an hour, the Lord helped me to 
lay open my self before him, to confesse mine iniquitys with 
grief soitow and shame, so far as I could call them to mind, 
to cry to god with many teares and groanes for pardon of, and 
power agt my sins, god brought my bitterest enemys to my 
thought and helpt me seriously to beg mercy for their soules 
conversion and salvation, and for my relations, this congrega- 
tion of Coley, all other congregations, the land of my nativity, 
and some other particulars— and the Lord hath given me some 
secret hints of pardon, and acceptance, and did communicate 
himself sweetly to my heart : now these things being con- 
sidered, I am much pressed in spirit to renew ray covenant in 
writing with my god, as I haue been doing it upon my knees, 
and oh that god would help me to be plain-dealing in this 
case, that I may neither deal falsely in making nor keeping 
covenant with my god, so far as I know any thing of this 
treacherous heart I desire to be upright and doun-right in this 
busines : for none is privy to these things but god and mine 
oun conscience, and the rather I doe this because I haue fond 
my heart slippery and inconstant, that I may tye my self under 
mine oun hand-writing, taking my warrant from Isai 41 5 : 
Dreadful Jehovah, I thy poor creature, and a grievous sinner, 
a transgressour from the womb, and a wanderer all my days, 
to this moment : lying under the guilt of the first mans first 
sin, and following those cursed steps in abundance of actuall 
abominations, I am by nature a child of wrath, slaue to Satan, 
under thy curse, and subject to hel-torments : But thou hast . 

of thine infinite mercy spared my life, and continued me aboue

fourty years in the world, whenas thou mightest in justice 
haue kickt me into hell the first moment of my breathing 
upon earth, thou broughtest me up under religious parents, 
gayest me thy good word, to read, and to hear preacht, didst 
touch my heart with remorse for my sins, and workings of 
heart before I was twelue yeares of age, and though I aposta- 
tized fearfully into great sins, and a course of security, yet thy 
spirit hath several times fetcht me home again, and thy grace 
hath lovingly entertained me : and still I find a naughty 
backsliding heart, withdrawing from the living god, and having 
tryed other ways of prayers, teares, vows, fastings, and still 
my heart giues me the slip, and grows loose, formal, distracted 
and secure, I here call thee my god to witnes that it is the 
desire of my soule to cleaue to the Lord with full purpose of 
my heart : I doe, therefore acquiesce in and admire thy 

glorious design of saving lost mankind by thy blessed son, my 
precious saviour, Jesus Christ, god-man, the only mediator 
betwixt an offended righteous god, and guilty condemned 
sinners, I thankfully accept of him as my only prophet to 
teach me by his word and spirit, the way to life, as my Priest 
alone to make satisfaction to thy justice for my sin, and inter- 
cede for my soule, as my Lord and soveraign to rule and govern 
me, and though thou hast helped me to study and preach 
many a sermon, to put up many a prayer, to distribute spiritual 
and corporal almes many a time, yet I renounce all as if I had 
done nothing at all, and rely only upon thy grace, and the 
merits of Cht for my justification, and if ever thou accept me 
here, or saue me herafter, 1 must put all upon the account of 
thy free-grace alone : I doe here also giue up my self to thee, 

body and soul all that I am, haue, can doe, or shal be, to thy 
service and use, looking upon my self as from henceforth no 
more as my oune but the Lords, intreating thee to sanctify my 
w T hole soule, spirit, and body, resolving by thy grace to spend 
and be spent for thee, if thou hast given me any facultys of 
soule, gifts of mind, strength of body, or oppertunitys of 
service, I resolue and hereby promise to imploy all in the way 
of my duty, to thy glory, depending only upon thee for 
strength and assistance, and I doe unfeignedly bind my self 
with all my might to fight against Satans temptations, to 
mortify my most beloved lusts and corruptions, to avoid all 
appearances and occasions of sin, and to this end to study thy

holy word, to perform all the dntys thou requirest of me, and 
to walk all my days in obedience to thy revealed will, to deny 
my self, lone mine enemys, bear the crosse thou layest upon 
me, and to follow my lord Jesus what way soever he shall be 
pleased to lead me : and if at any time through the weaknes 
of my flesh and the strength of temptation I be overcome my 
desire and design is by the assistance of thy grace to rise again 
by repentance, to confesse my sins, to make fresh application, 
to the blood of Christ, for pardon, to renew my promises to 
sin no more, to be more watchfull over mine oune heart, 
humbly hoping for mercy according to the covenant of thy 
grace, desiring thee not to leaue me at any time to my selfe, 
but to hold me in thy hand that my foot-steps slip not, and 0 
that thou wouldst croun these ingagemts with strength of per- 
formance, and perseverance to the end : I thank thee that 

thou hast given me an heart to make this covenant, that thou 
hast accepted me in my surety, through whom all my good 
flows from thee, and through whom my self and all I doe is 
accepted by thee,: thus I haue avouched the Lord to be my 
god, hoping thou dost ratify it in heaven, according to thy 
word this is the day of my solemne plighting my troth to thee, 
the day of my soules espousals, unto god, in the sadnes of my 
heart for my former miscariages, hoping for, and longing 
to injoy the compleat solemnization of this mariage in the 
kingdom of heaven with joy and triumph, thus doe I make 
bold, 0 my god, to subscribe my self 



this day Aug 29 71 setting my self to review my state and 
especially my course of life since that solemne entring into 
covenant with god, I doe find many things amisse, and that I 
haue not kept close to it, but haue omitted duty, carelesly per- 
formed duty, closed with temptations, committed sins, fallen 
again into a course of carelesnes, Jukewarmnes— I haue ther- 
fore, first dealt with mine oun heart, vveh I found in an 
ill-frame, then read Hos 14 well I saw was proper to my con- 
dition, I commented upon it, my heart was melted by it, then 
I fell on my knees, and found some measure of gods presence, 
in confessing sin, begging mercy I layd the bible before me

upon my knees, improved those commands, directions, promises, 
and pathetical workings of true penitents in that chapter, rny 
heart was a little more warmed, the fire burned, and oh what 
a flame hath god stirred up in my soul !— now I experience 
that word that god healeth backslidings, and that he loues 
freely, oh that the same free grace may prevent future back- 
sliding ! that I may never return into folly as I haue done, — 
alas I haue found a wretched, treacherous, abominable heart, I 
haue great cause to suspect the truth of my repentance, 
whether it be suitable and sufficient, because its so ineffectual 
to prevent sinning, I haue fallen by mine iniquity, its a 
wonder I am not in hell before this, god be mercifull to me 
a sinner, none knows how vile I am ; I am afraid to fall into 
sin again, afraid to goe out of my study into the world, into 
company, imployment, I find little strength, I am weary of 
the world, weary of my sinfull heart ; oh wretched man that I 
am who shall deliver me from this body of death, when will 
death part body and soul, that it may part soul and sin ! when 
shall I be aboue the reach of satans temptations or occasions 
of sin ; Lord hasten that blessed loose, that I may be with 
cht, my Lord, amen — 

On Saturday night about 7 or 8 a clock, Feb 6 1674-5 the 
night after the councel had passed this vote to call in our 
licences there appeared a very formidable comet or blazing-star 
wch seemed to rise up out of the earth and seemed to hover 
over white-hall, and the treasurers house— it had a mighty long 
tayle of fire, it was blood towards the end of it— it was dread- 
full, the guard saw it, and watermen, many hundreds, Tho: 
Wakefild was there at that same time, and spoke with some 
that saw it, its ceartainly true— he told me this day, being 
Feb 28 1674-5— yet the Court regards it not : 

In May 1 and latter end of April An dom 1677 was another 
blazing-star or comet appearing at London for 9 nights 
togather multitudes saw it this is ceartain much is spoken of it. 

We had licenses for preaching the gospel in meeting-places 
from the King, may 1 1672 — the King and Councel issued out 
an order Feb 6 1674-5 to call them in and declare them void 
Accordingly Feb 14 I gaue notice to my people that our licences 
were recalled, and we were to preach no more by vertue of 
licences, and so tooke leaue of them, my reasons for so doing 
are such as these

1 Because I would comply, so far as I may with our gover- 
nors minds and pleasure, that they may be convinced we are 
peaceble in the land, and to take off the imputation of sedition, 
wch god knows we are not guilty of 

2 Because the Parliament is shortly to meet and at the last 
Session were taking our case into their consideration, and tis 
hoped if we behaue ourselues peace bly they may restore our 
liberty by law 

3 These licences not being according to the established laws 
of the land, but by the Kings Prerogatiue, it is by some feared 
they may proue of dangerous consequence, for if he may 
dispense with laws upon one account, he may also supersede 
them upon another — 

4 Severall of my brethren elsewhere haue given over this 
publick way of preaching by licences, especially at Leeds that 
had held up valiantly, and had bestowed 400li in building 
and preparing a meeting-place, besides Mr Nesses beyond the 
bridg — 

5 Some of my brethren that haue been something backward 
in preaching would haue censured and condemned me as 
obstructing their liberty if I had continued my work as they 
haue been apt to doe— and I would not giue any offence — 

6 Because I would not trepan or insnare people but let them 
know upon what termes we are now that they might not lay 
the blame of me if herafter my fine be laid upon them, but 
that they might know the worst and count the cost — 

7 My people most of them (especially the most intelligent) 
advised to it, and judged it the most prudent course that could 
be taken to withdraw into more retired meetings and not 
be so publick. 

8 I doe not repent because I see it was a wonderful! heart- 
affecting warning day, god raised wonderfull passionate 
motions in the hearts of people at that sad parting which may 
doe good, and is a token for good for future — and he hath 
graciously met my heart in more retired waitings on him— 
blessed be god— 

Yet though I did giue this notice, notwithstanding we have 
injoyed several days of considerable liberty in my meeting- 
place, pretty full of people and begun about 8 a clock, preacht 
till 12 twice, this day being March 21 1674-5 J begun half 
an hour after 8 — had done about one— blessed be god 



COVENANTS, EXPERIENCES, &amp;c. 

The Bp belonging to Bristall hath been very resolute and 
peevish agt Non-conformists in that town, and disturbed them 
before licences were recalled, but the matter being brought 
before the King and councell they could not prevail, but now 
they were mad and raging, laid hold on an honest minister 
then put him in prison, yea into a filthy low hole, his people 
offered to be bond in some thousand pounds for his appear- 
ance, but nothing would serve into that prison he must goe, 
and being put there he dyed in a few days, and dying he laid 
his blood at the door of the Bishop and mayor — our first intel- 
ligence of this was march 16 1674-5 — 1 hear also some justices 
them selues in London came to Mr Calamys meeting noted 
down names, as informers — god knows what may come next — 
The minister that dyed in prison at Bristall was one Mr.

SOLEMNE COVENANTS. 

I read of the servants of god making covenants with tht 
Lord : and of the Lords willing entretaint of them when 
ingaging themselues in covenant: thus did Joshua, Asa, 
Jehoshaphat, Josiah — as to more publick and politick cove- 
nants : and when nations, people, persons, have been con- 
verted, they have solemnly made vows, and ingaged themselues 
to god by covenant, Jer. 50 5 : Isai 19 21 : and in the after- 
course of their liues, they haue particularly renewed their 
covenant with god, as David for a more close and Catholic 
obedience, psal 119 106 : v 48 my hands also will I lift up to 
thy comts, which I have loved, that was the form of an oath, — 
this also god requires, psalm 76 11 : and swearing by his name is 
a solemne act of worship Deut 6 13 : jer 5 7 : 4 2 : Isai 65 16 : 

Upon such considerations as these I have formerly entred 
a solemne promise, covenant and protestation to devote, dedi- 
cate, and make over myself to the Lord : and I have abundant 
ground, reason and necessity now more then ever to renew my 
covenant : but alas I haue broken covenants formerly made to 
the grief of my heart : on Saturday july 5 1672 in prepartory 
dutys to the Lords supper, I entred a solemne covenant (tho 
not in writing) to be the Lords, on Lords day it was sealed 
in the Lords supper but upou thuesday july 16 — I fell into a 
course of carelesnes, self-conceitednes, formality in duty, and 
god left me to backslide from him into sin, — the same day 
(even this day) god hath set my soul to the excercise of re- 
newed repentance, oh how bitter was sin to my sonle ! how 
base was I in mine own eyes ! how low did god prostrate me 
upon the floor with a flood of teares, and then, and there did 
my soul set itself to the solemne renewing of covenants — But 
why should 1 renew my covenants to break it ! its a tempta- 
tion to doe so no more, lest I aggravate my sin and condemna- 
tion. Oh how woful is my case when my remedy is turned to 
be my malady : but why should I forbear duty because of 
after-relapses ! should I not bind my soul with stronger bonds ! 
should I not inquire whether I went not out too much in mine 
owne strength ! Oh that I could now at last vow and pay, 
Lord bind this treacherous heart faster, — and now I will make 
another essay and write down the substance of the vows I have 
made this day in the dolour of my soul

Eternall god, the all-seeing, heart-searching Jehovah, a god 
of infinite holines and therefore eanst not look on sin, of jus- 
tice and wilt punish iniquity and reward holines ; of wisdome, 
and dost know how to governe the world in equity of truth 
and wiltst make good both promises and threatenings : of 
patience, and bearest long with sinners, yea also of goodnes 
and mercy and therefore canst and wilst pardon the sins of 
penitent soules : I thy poore wretched creature a miserable 
sinner, guilty of Adams sin, and of many thousands of actuall 
abominations, the sins of my unconverted state thou knowest, 
and through grace I hope hast pardoned : but my sad relapses 
iuto sinne since my soule had some experience of thee are of a 
more double dye and dangerous hue in some respects receiving 
more dangerous aggravations, yet I find upon record, that thou, 

0 Lord dost invite backsliding Israel to return, promising that 
thou wilt not cause thine anger to fall upon them, because thou 
art merciful — Jer 3 12 : yea thou saist, Hos 14 4 I will heal 
their backsliding I will lone them freely : — I am incouraged, o 
Lord, according to these promises to return after my grievous 
falls by repentances to thyself hoping, not in my teares and 
prayers, but in thy sons merits and mediation to find accept- 
ance with thy majesty, and having this day found some fruits 
of thy grace in a broken heart, I rest my poor troubled soul 
upon thy free-grace in Christ my sweet and alsufficient saviour, 
through whom alone thou art wel-pleased with sinners : and 
upon some apprehensions of thy loue and grace to my poor 
soule, I doe here subscribe ray self to be thy bond servant for 
ever, and doe by thy grace resolue to be wholly the Lords, for 

1 am not mine own, but bought with a price, therfore my 
heart can say truly I desire to be to thy use and glory : and I 
resolue by thv grace for the future to sin no more : and to this 
end my soul desires to subscribe these several articles, 

1 I doe purpose from henceforth to read every day some 
portion of scripture, which containes the rule of my obedience, 
and motiues therto, and meanes therof : to ponder upon it 
diligently, to make it the way of my councel, to hide it in my 
heart that I may not sin against my good god : 

2 I resolue by the Lords assistance every day to retire my 
self to closet-work, and there to set my self to the dutys of 
self-examination, meditation, secret prayer, that I may take an 
account of my spirit and actings, to see how grace doth grow

and increase, or decrease and decay how corruptions work 
within me, and also to beg pardon and assistance from god : 

3 I doe promise (if my treacherous heart deceiue me not in 
performance) to watch over my heart and ways, to avoid all 
occasions of sin, to make a covenant with my earthly members, 
to hate and eschew all appearances of sin, and to walk with 
holy fear and trembling before my god : to keep up my con- 
stant warre with the flesh, and to stand at a distance with 
satans temptations, and the worlds insinuations : and for this 
end to set my self always in the presence of my god : espe- 
cially after inlargements : 

4 If at any time I be surprized with a temptation, or fall 
into a fit of security or sensuality, I am determined by the 
grace of god to rise up at least to get up upon my knees, and 
have recourse to god by repentance, that I might maintain 
actuall communion with god : for methinks I cannot be long 
at a distance from my best friend oh that god would supply 
my soul with renewed strength to perform my promises and 
this particular vow of better obedience, without him I can doe ■ 
nothing : Joh 15 5: Lord help thy sinful sorrowful

Once more, having this day the oppertunity of secrecy,

of self-dedication to god, thus, 

Infinite Jehovah : it is no small incouragement to this poor 
nothing sinfull creature, that I liue under a covenant of grace, 
not of workes, wherein though I sin (as god knows to the 
grief of my heart I find by sad experience) yet repentance is 
not unavailable, nor the sentence irreversible, but an appeal is 
admitted from the bench of justice to the throne of grace, from

adoring thy free-grace if thou entertain me, and who knows 
but god will accept. 0 that ever it should enter into thy 
heart to send thy son to redeem sinners ! oh that over-flowing 
loue should interpose a surety to pay the debt of bankrupts ! 
I accept it Lord, with an hearty welcome, I acquiesce in this 
thy way, and will seek out no other way to secure my precious 
soul : my soul embraceth sweet Jesus in the arms of my faith, 
welcome Christ with thy yoke, welcome the crosse of Christ, 
oh that my soul might take cht aright and not mistake him, 
I am willing to part with world, lusts, all for Christ, and with 
my self unto Christ : I have no other saviour, no other sover- 
aign, the Lord my righteousnes is the Lord my judg, the

Sweet Lord Jesus thou art my hope, help, light, life, thy name

hast loosed my bonds, my person and all I have is thine, yea I 
looke upon it as the greatest priviledge to be the Lords devoted

greatest honour or comfort in the whole world, and oh what a

This day Sept 23 1673 in the afternoon having trifled away 
most of the forenoon in reading a physick-book that one 
brought me, and yet having a sermon to preach to morrow, I 
set my self about 4 a clock to search my heart, consider my 
ways and then fell down upon my knees, confessed my sins, 
and out of a deep sense of my vilenes I prostrated my self upon 
my face, god helped me in some measure to loath myself for all 
my abominations, beg pardon, the lord secretly assured my 
heart of acceptance, healing my backsliding, I rose again to 
my knees, pleaded for my wife, children, servant, congregation, 
church, it much affected my heart to hear wt an unworthy 
begging wanderer preacht in my old pulpit last Lords day, 
god helped me to plead for ministers restitution, and to make 
some solemne vows in these cases, the sumne wherof I am 
pressed in spirit to put into writing, thus — 

Dreadful, eternal, omnipotent god, who hast lookt doun upon 
this dunghill earth, to take a church to thy self out of the lost 
and lapsed race of Adam, hast purchased it to thy self by thy 
sons blood, and sanctifyed it by thy blessed spirit, and hast of 
thine infinite free-grace in Christ made thy poor worthies 
worm a member of this mistical body, and also hast counted 
me faithfull putting me into the ministry, to convert sinners 
and confirme thy saints, who hast maintained thy church from 
the beginning of the world to this day, and hast promised to 
be with it to the end of the world, yet though thou doe nourish 
and cherish it dost also think good to correct and chastize it, 
for thy peoples sins, and for the attaining of thy wise and 
gracious ends, hast particularly whipt thy church in these 
nations with the eclipsing of the gospel, and hiding the lights 
under a bushel for these 11 years past, I acknowledge thou art 
righteous in all this thats brought upon us, we haue deserved 
this and much more, even utter desolation, and, I o Lord, 
haue had an hand, yea the greatest share in all this calamity, 
and accordingly doe acknowledg my own and thy peoples sins, 
craving pardon in the blood of thy son, and healing to the 
Land, and thy return to thy church, and the restauration of 
thy ministers to their publick work — the harvest truely is 
plenteous, theres multitudes of famishing soules, but labourers 
few, many loyterers. Oh thou Lord of the harvest, thrust 
forth labourers into thine harvest, men have thrust them out,

and think to keep them out but shew that thou art stronger 
then men : amongst the rest of thy servants bring into his 
station this poor worthies worm consider my teares, desires, 
remember thy peoples breathings, necessitys, look into their 
supply, provision, if thou wilt be pleased to make use of the 
son of thy precious servant (now in heaven) to doe good in 
this congregation, I shall prayse thee, as thou knowest my 
heart hath desired, prayed many a time, if otherwise thou hast 
reserved thy worthies servant aliue, preserved me in the place 
to restore me to my work, in this my ancient service amongst 
the people of my first and only choyce and charge, I shall 
blesse thee, in token wherof I humbly promise, purpose and 
vow this evening to dedicate myself afresh to thy work and 
service in setting my self to study more industriously, pray 
more fervently, preach more affectionately, and perform every 
part of my pastorall work more conscionably. I doe purpose 
by thy grace assisting me, to spend and be spent in my Lords 
work, and to lay out my self in publick and private, in what 
ways thou shalt convince me of to be my duty, to win soules to 
Jesus Christ, by studying and preaching upon such texts as 
have a direct tendency that way, to excercise discipline accord- 
ing to scripture-rule, and goe before my people in the example 
of an holy conversation the poor gifts I haue I doe resolue to 
improue and lay out for thee, since all is thine own, and all the 
reward I expect or desire is the success of my poor labours, 
through thy help my work shal be my wages, I wil not seek 
preferment or the great things of this world, I haue had abun- 
dant experience that when I was sent out without staffe or 
scrip yet I haue lacked nothing, nor can I make account my 
publick labours will bring in more worldly advantage then my 
private hath done, but my soul doth so much long for more 
publick usefulnes that I can freely be content (so far as I know 
this treacherous heart) to abate some outward ease and com- 
fort, and run greater hazzards for the publick service of the 
church : god grant I may be inabled to stand to this vow : to 

which I subscribe myself ,, . ^ T t -i

found my heart dead, distracted and out of frame, yet went on 
in my work god was pleased to come in with some meltings, 
twice I prostrated my self upon my face, once in pleading with 
god for the successe of my labours in the ministry, another 
time in expostulating with the Lord for the nation, wch I fear 
is in a tottering condition, and for the king and nobles, wherin 
my heart was not so draun out as I could have desired, but my 
soul was more affectionately set to make a solemne covenant 
with my god, that if he saw good to suffer popery to prevail in 
the kingdome, 1 was resolved by his grace to own and adhere 
to his truth even unto death, the matter of my vow I here set 
down that I may say hereafter the vows of god are upon me, 
and if god inable me to keep it I may be thankful if he with- 
draw his assistance my soul may be ashamed, and humbled 
before the Lord : 

My glorious and gracious Soveraigne, my parents presented 
me to thee in Baptisme in my infancy, wherin I was listed to 
be thy souldier to fight under the banner of the Captain of my 
salvation against Satan, world, flesh, and when I came to yeares 
of discretion and under convictions (and I hope conversion) by 
thy holy spirit, I again personally renewed that covenant, by a 
solemne self-resignation to the Lord, giving my hand, and 
therin (I hope) my heart to that good god that gaue his son 
for me, that hath given himself, son, spirit to me, and I never 
had cause to repent of this bargain, the more I haue tasted the 
Lords goodnes the more haue I been confirmed in my choyce 
and the more I haue sincerely waited on god, the more hath 
my soul tasted his love, and now lying under sad apprehensions 
of some approaching persecutions by popish adversarys to the 
true Religion, not knowing what things shall befall me betwixt 
this and the grave, I here once againe list myself as a volun- 
teer under thy sacred colours to warre a good warfare I doe 
purpose by thy grace to adhere to the true reformed protestant 
Religion to contend earnestly for the faith which was once 
delivered to the saints, yea to resist unto blood, striving against 
sin : my full purpose of heart is to cleaue to the Lord, what- 
ever it cost me, Behold I am ready, by the assistance of thy 
grace, to lose yea hate father and mother, and wife and chil- 
dren, and brethren and sisters, house, land, all my outward 
comforts, yea and credit, liberty, and whatever is dear to me 
for thy sake and thy gospel, yea thou that art the searcher of

hearts knowest that I count not my life dear unto my self, so 
that I might finish my course with joy, and the ministry which 
I have received of the Lord Jesus to testify the gospel of the 
grace of god, by the strength of god I will keep on in my work 
and way, in the dutys of praying, preaching, and all Christian 
excercises, and neglect no oppertunity to serve my god or saue 
soules, and though I would doe gods work prudently, yet god 
forbid that a pretence of prudence should jus tie out faithfulnes : 
though I be not worthy of that high transcendent honour of 
being a martyr for my sweet saviour, yet my present prayer 
and purpose is that I might not deny his name, but (if he call 
me to it), I may witnesse a good profession by continuing in 
the things wch I haue learned, and been assured of knowing 
of I haue learned them, I design by grace to hold fast yea and 
hold forth in my place the word of his patience. Let the Lord 
doe with me what seemes good in his eyes, come life come 
death, I am the Lords welcome Christ with a crosse, welcome 
a fiery chariot to ride in to my fathers pallace welcome reproach 
for the sake of Christ let him be magnifyed in my body, 
whether by life or death : let me fill up that wch is behind of 
the sufferings of Christ in my flesh : if I be offered upon the 
sacrifice and service of the churchs faith, I shal rejoyce let 
what will come so I may in joy my Lord Christ : as through 
grace I haue thankfully suffered a short imprisonment for god, 
and as (I can say it sincerely) I haue suffered joyfully the 
spoiling of my goods, so I hope I can comfortably beleave my 
god will helpe me not to loue my life unto the death for this 
gospel I haue professed and preached : But oh my god, I am 
sensible of the frailty of my flesh, treachery of my heart and 
the temptations of Satan, and I am assured if thou leaue me I 
shall ceartainly faile and fall as peter a standard-bearer fainted, 
and many better than I haue miscarryed, therfore I doe fly to 
thy alsufficient grace, thou alone art able to make me stand, 
and to keep me from falling, support and shore up this weak 
worthies worme, its not the strengh of gifts, parts, learning, 
interest, resolution, no nor received grace that can support 
me, tis nothing but assisting and corroberating grace and alls 
a case whether the party be strong or weak whom thou under- 
takest to support, though I cannot dispute for truth yet thou 
canst make me both to dispute and dye for Christ though of 
my self I can doe just nothing yet by the strength of Christ

This day being March 15 167f the very self same day on 
wch 44 years agoe I was baptized at Bolton Church in Lane : 
this being a Lords day, as I suppose that was 1 am again 
pressed in spirit actually and solemnly to give up my self to 
god, by making a solemne covenant with him, — especially 
having been this day spending my strength and speaking to 
god and men in the solemne excercises of this sabboth, and oh 
that my heart might goe along with my mouth and pen : 

Oh Eternal god, the god of the spirits of all flesh, who hast 
made me and formed me in the womb, and brought me into 
the world, who hast given me life and favour and thy visita- 
tion hath hitherto preserved my spirit ; I thy poor miserable 
sinfull creature was conceived in sin and brought forth in ini- 
quity, and though my parents were gracious, yet could not 
communicate to me supernatural grace by naturall generation, 
I was wholly born in sin according to that sinful likenes which 
was superinduced by the fall, oh how filthy was my heart ! 
therfore needed washing : how destitute of thine image ! ther- 
fore needed renovation, what depravednes, and tendency to 
vanity in all my soules facultys ! hence was there an absolute 
necessity of a new birth and of regeneration : How like was 

I Ezekiel’s exposed orphans, my navil was not cut, nor was I 
washed in water to supple me, I was not salted at all, nor 
swadled at all, none eye pityed me — but I was cast out in the 
open field of the world, as to any spiritual aid wch my relations 
or the whole creation could afford me, fain would my parents 
haue helpt me, but could not, it was beyond the verge of their 
power : there was some or other found to wash my body from 
blood, but none was found to wash my soul from guilt : they 
might put cloths on my body to cover my corporal nakednes, 
but they could not cover the sinful shameful nakednes of my 
precious soule : But thou, 0 Lord, hast been my god from 

my mothers womb, thou providest a remedy for man as soon 
as the malady appeared, and now dost obviate our natural

misery with tidings of recovery, thou didst put me into the 
laver of regeneration at the porch and entrance of the temple 
of thy church, thou didst put upon me the stole or white robe 
of righteousnes, and didst list and inroll my name with them 
that are written among the living in Hierusalem : my parents 
and friends did present me to the Lord in the great congrega- 
tion, where I was solemnely devoted to thee, o my god, and 
received the seal of thy holy covenant, the badg and livery of 
thy souldiers, even baptism, therby I was [sacramentally] 
ingrafted into Christ and there was that day a solemnization of 
an heavenly marriage betwixt Christ and my soule, when 
(though I was not capable of expressing consent myself, yet) 
my sponsors (whose I was, and whose will was taken as mine) 
professed a willingnes, that I should be the Lords, dedicated 
to god the father, son, and holy ghost. So that (taking my 
Baptisme for the ordinance as performed in all its essential 
parts according to the true intent of Christ in his institution, 
containing my inward covenanting with god) that day there 
was a mutual covenant between god the father, son, and holy 
ghost, and my poor soul, a deed of gift sealed on both partys, 
wherin god gaue himself to me, and my soul was given up to 
god. I tooke god for my father, and he took me for his 
adopted son, and delivered to me by solemne investiture pardon 
of my sins and title to the mercy s of this and of another life : 
oh what honour was this ! what a rich mercy and high privi- 
lege ! but alas how have I owned this covenant-relation ? what 
have I done in pursuit therof? how seldom hath my heart 
been brought to aiue actual consent at yeares of discretion, as 
Moses did! how negligent haue I been to answer the ends 
therof ! nay how sadly did I violate my baptismal vow ! I 
haue lived now 44 yeares since I was marked for gods sheep, 
but, Lord, what a wretch am I that haue been wandring upon 
the mountains of sin and errour the most part of my days, its 
true I haue given myself up to the Lord many a time by cove- 
nant but haue as often violated the same, to the grief of thy 
spirit, dishonouring thy name, wouuding of my own soule, 
Lord what shall I doe, what amends can I now make ! I am 
a perjured wretch, a sacriligious villain, a woful apostate ; but

and admits of repentance, it is founded upon a mediator, and 
admits of faith as the condition therof : my soul takes incour-

Lord dost thou not say thou wilt be the god of thy people and 
their seed ? was not I holy by vertue of that feederal relation ? 
and though thou art bound to none, yet hast thou not made 
thyself a debtor by thy gracious promise, wch thou saidst is 
made to thy people and to their children ! Lord was I not 
long agoe entertained into thy family, and wilt thou cast me 
out for my lamented misdemeanours ? didst thou not put thy 
name upon me ? shall that be now razed out ? did not that 
ordinance seale remission of sins, and acceptance into favour ? 
and is not that a chief branch of the new covenant, wch my 
soul needs ? didst thou adopt me as thy child, and seal up my 
inheritance, and wilt thou now disinherit me ? god forbid :

son of thy handmaid, thou hast loosed my bonds, i e wherwith

meanour that doth dissolue the marriage-knot, I come therfore 
once again in the sense of this solemne covenant-relation, 
renewing my repentance and my vows, acting faith upon my 
sweet saviour, (whose souldier and servant I am) the captain 
of my salvation, that thou, sweet Jesus, didst entertain thy 
poor worm, and not suffer me to depart from thee, and oh that 
my soul could suck some strength from thee in and upon the 
account of this ordinance ! 0 that a divine quality might 
thereby be infused into me by this seal of regeneration in the 
room of original corruption ! oh that I might by this put on 
Cht, by being baptized into his death, and his resurrection, to 
dye more to sin, and Hue unto righteousnes ! oh that the sense 
of this word, I am a Christian, may fortify my spirit agt all 
temptations ! Lord, I am listed under thy colours, appointed 
to fight thy battels, agt flesh, world, devil, wilt thou forsake 
me in the open field ? what a dishonour will it be to thee if my 
soul be foild. I am baptized into one body with thy faithfiill 
members, oh let me haue an assimilation to them, and com- 
munion with them in spirit. I was buryed with Christ in 
baptisme, oh that I might mortify the flesh with affections and 
lusts ! Lord let the sense and strength of that ordinance be 
upon my heart, that like as Christ was raised up from the 
dead by the glory of the father, my soul might from hence- 
forth walk in newnes of life ! oh that I could now afresh

I haue within this week met with more feares about my two 
sons abroad at learning, and sustained more bitter agonys of 
soule then ever I did in all my life that I remember upon any 
account, occasioned upon some reports that I heard concerning 
them, wch multiplyed in my imaginations, and exceedingly 
aggravated by my own jeolousys and suspicions so that I was 
almost distracted, could not sleep quietly, nor take content in 
any thing, though I concealed it so from my wife and family, 
that nothing was discerned, however god made good use of it 
to humble my heart more effectually for mine own sins, to be 
importunate with god for mercy, upon friday night jan 14 
1676 I was in great bitternes of spirit, so on Saturday night, 
yet god helpt me comfortably through my Lords day work, 
munday, tuesday, Wednesday still god bore up my heart in 
hopes and frequent wrestling so that this day being thursday 
morning, jan 20 76 I am inclined to issue my sad thoughts 
that I haue had, in these meditations, vows, covenants and 
resolues 

0 Lord, How weak and slippery is the soul of man ! how 
easily is the mind put out of order ! how hard to be settled 
and composed ! the strongest spirits are found weak if god 
leaue us : we need no more to torment us then what we carry 
in our own bosomes, and if divine grace help not, self-arguings 
will doe no good, my soul hath felt such working affections, 
and such contradictory tumultuous thoughts as I thought once 
I should never haue been left to : I might say, the troubles of 
my heart are inlarged, my feares increased. 0 how little 
power haue I over my own thoughts ! nothing would compose

my mind but gods grace, I feel the truth of that word, when 
he giveth quietnes, who then can make trouble, and when he 
hideth his face who then can behold him ? but now I feel the 
benefit of prayer, in the multitude of my sad thoughts within 
me thy councels and comforts, 0 Lord, delight my soul, thou 
wast ready to saue me, and thou hast brought me up out of an 
horrible pit, out of the mirey clay, and set my feet upon a 
rock, and established my goings. Oh my Lord, thou hast 
known my soul in adversity, and now I giue up my self and 
mine unto thee, upon a new score, upon renewed obligations 
from thee : how things are or will be yet with my sons I know 
not, but thou hast quieted my heart in the actings of faith in 
prayer upon which I doe resolue by thy grace to call upon thee 
as long as I liue, and trust in thy covenant for my posterity. 
Lord my sons are thine, more thine than mine, thou gavest 
them me, and I haue given them back again to thee, not only 
in the ordinance of baptism, and many a time since -in prayers 
and teares, but in a peculiar manner I have, upon May 15 
1673 when they were to goe abroad, giving them up to god in 
a most solemne ordinance with much affection, before many 
witnesses, the remembrance of that day beares up my heart 
with much incouragement, that god will hear and answer, in 
giving grace to mine : Lord, my children are part of my selfe, 
and in giving up myself to thee I haue also given them to 
thee, and wilt thou not accept of this loan which is lent to the 
Lord ? are not children thy peculiar heritage ? is not the 
fruit of the womb thy reward ? is not thy covenant firm and 
free ? may it not be made good to me as well as to Abraham 
or David ? nay is it not truth to Jacob, or mercy to Abraham ? 
had I any thing better then my own soul and the soules of my 
wife and children to giue thee, thou shouldest haue it, thou 
hast most right to me and mine : Lord are thy coven an t- 
mercys worn out ? hast thou but one blessing, my father ? 
didst not thou entice my heart to thee ? and hast thou not put 
me and mine into the same bottom and bond of ihe covenant ? 
hast thou not spoken well concerning me for a great while to 
come ? wilt thou begin now to cut off this blessed entaile, at 
the third generation ? doth not thy promise reach to a thou- 
sand generations of them that fear thee ? 0 Lord deal kindly 

with thy servant and my seed for thou hast brought thy ser- 
vant into a covenant of the Lord with thee, notwithstanding

if there be iniquity in me, scourge me thy self, for why 
shouldst thou leaue mine to the temptations of satan, and to 
their own hearts lusts (which is worse), to be a dishonour to 
thee here and to be damned eternally ? Lord is there no differ- 
ence betwixt covenanted children and such as are out of cove- 
nant ? shall children of so many prayers and teares miscarry ? 
wilt thou not take possession of thine own right and of thy 
sons purchase ? I know, Lord, neither my house nor heart is 
so with god as it ought to be, but thou hast made a covenant 
with me ordered in all things and sure, and this is all my sal- 
vation and all my desire although thou make it not to grow : 
according to this, giue me leaue to plead with thee, by way of 
concession, I must needs say I haue broken the covenant by 
unbeleef, impenetency, and many miscarriages, and thou 
mayst justly leaue my sons to walk in my steps, but doth not 
thy covenant provide a remedy ? is there not pardon in Christs 
blood for poor penitent sinners ? nay is there not repentance 
included in the gospel-graunt ? nay hast thou not given my 
soul repentance and remission of sins ? and what if my heart 
and house be out of order, yet thy covenant is well ordered, 
and can order me and mine : what if my soul be off and on, 
fickle and inconstant, yet thy covenant is sure and stedfast : 
and can settle both my soul and family : the temporal safty of 
my house, and eternall salvation of my relations are both con- 
tained in the covenant — and this is all my desire, thou knowest 
Lord, all ray desires are before thee and my groaning is not hid 
from thee, suppose thou make not my house to grow in number, 
estate, or honour, thou knowest that not my end and errand in 
my addresses to thee, doe I beg worldly preferments for my 
self or sons ! these are insignificant, have I not told thee so 
many a time, that I shall be freely content if they be no richer 
then I haue been, to haue from hand to mouth, or haue uo 
greater dignitys or benefices in thy church then I haue had, to 
be at a poor chappel, if god restores, or in a house to preach 
the word to poor sinners and convert soules to god, if things 
continue as they are, I would rather haue those serious affec- 
tionate experienced preachers amongst a few despised servants 
of god, then doctors, Bishops, in the highest ecclesiastical prr -

The Lord having in some degree graunted the mercy begged 
of god with reference to my sons sending them safely home out 
of Scotland April 18 1677 — the day of their birth, being also 
studious, and hopefull for religion, I did according to my pre- 
ceding vow appoint the 9th of May for a solemne day of thank- 
ful nes to god, for his mercys to them in all their journeys, 
studys, and ways, wherin god did graciously help us in singing 
and speaking to his praise, and blessed be the Lord it was not 
without some signall appearances of god amongst us, the morn- 
ing after I am pressed in spirit to renew my ingagemt still 
upon this return of prayer, to bind my self to the Lord — but 
being that day hindred by occasions, god added further evi- 
dences of returns of prayer, for the afternoon of that day 
according to appointment about 12 of my conference-young 
men came to spend some time in thankfulnes for the proved 
mercy. I set my sons to give an account of what mercys they 
had to bless god for, they both spoke very sensibly of several 
particulars wherin gods goodness had abounded to their soules 
and bodys, and prayd both and praised god therin very feelingly 
and affectionately, John had framed a discourse upon psal 71 
17 (a text that I had given him) very understanding and the

was the better to my spirit and it brought into my mind the 
passage of Hezekiah and the whole assembly taking councei to 
keep other seven days, when their hearts were warmed with 
gladnes, 2 chron 30 23 

Dreadfull Majesty, whose eyes run to and fro through the 
earth to shew thy selfe strong in the behalf of them whose 
heart is perfect with thee, who keepest covenant with thy 
people, and upholdest the feet of thy saints, and blessest their 
goings out and coinings in, creating upon every dwelling place 
of Mount Sion a cloud and hast said of the godly man, that 
wtsoever he doth it shall prosper, and he shall decree a thing 
and it shal be established unto him, and the light shall shine 
upon his wayes, I thy poor servant that was dedicated to thee 
by my parents from mine infancy, and haue given up my self 
to thy work many a time, doe find by sensible proof that thou 
hast accepted and blessed this dedicate thing, from hence I am 
incouraged to consecrate my two sons, (my all) to thee the 
Lord my god, thou didst incline their hearts to chuse this 
calling and no other, and openedst a door for their disintangled 
education and didst put into my hands pleutifull provision for 
them, and didst lay before me a conviction of youths frailty, 
and therby didst quicken my heart in prayr that thou mightest 
take occasion to giue a fuller, and more satisfying answer, thou 
didst put me in feares that the mercy might be sweeter, a sen- 
tence of death was upon it, that it might appear the resurrec- 
tion was the fruit of the Almighty power and goodues. Well, 
its fit my dear Lord should fetch a compasse, and walk in a 
road peculiar to himself, for though he be lost behind our wall 
of sin, or a mountain of sense, yet is he making approaches to 
us, and comes in a right way, his presence countervails his 
long stay and seeming disappointing us : Lord thou art worth 
waiting for, and they that wait for thee shall never be ashamed 
light is sown for the righteous and joy for the upright in heart, 
they that sow in teares shall reap in joy, and the wetter the 
seed-time the sweeter the harvest, I can say it, and subscribe to 
it, thou that didst shew me great and sore troubles hast 
quickened me again, and comforted me on every side, thou 
hast turned for me my mourning into dancing, thou hast put 
off* my sackcloth and girded me with gladnes, thou hast pre- 
vented my feares, and granted me the desire of my heart, even 
the welfare of my children this was the white in my eye,

the main request next to the salvation of mine own soul this 
thou hast added as the crown of all my other mercys, thou hast 
reformed their lines, adorned their minds with learning, quali- 
fied them with competent gifts, and giuen me some comfortable 
grounds of hope for a work of grace, in their hearts, thou hast 
made them diligent in their studys, found them friends in 
strange places, preserved their lives, restored health, returned 
them to their fathers house in peace, and given me some 
grounds of hope thou wilt use them in the work of the ministry. 
And now what shall I render to the Lord for all his benefits 
towards me ? I haue appointed and observed days of thank- 
fulnes for these mercys, haue declared thy loving-kindnes before 
a considerable congregation, both to them in preaching, and to 
thee with them in prayer, I haue feasted their bodys, and done 
something for the poor for I am not willing to offer to the Lord 
that which costs me nothing, yet of thine own haue we brought 
thee, the matter of the gift cometh of thine hand, the manner 
of giuing is of thy grace, I am thy debtor for both, thou hast 
provided thy self a sacrifice, and put both occasion and oppor- 
tunity into our hands, but is there no more required of me ? is 
it the work of a day only ? nay surely god calls for another 
frame of spirit, that cords of loue might draw, and bands of a 
man might tye my soul faster to the Lord. Oh my Lord, 
truly I am thy servant. I am thy servant, and the son of thy 
handmaid, thou hast loosed my bonds, I loue the Lord, because 
he hath heard my voyce, yea 1 will call upon him as long as I 
Hue, my soul shall return to the Lord as my only rest, my soul 
shall make her boast of the Lord, and tell all the saints that 
fear god what he hath done for my soul and family. I will 
henceforth incourage and invite all indigent and affiicted crea- 
tures to goe to this door, where I haue sped so well, yea by the 
help of gods grace I will walk more exactly before the Lord in 
the land of the liuing, and devote my self more to his sendee 
in his work to bring more glory to god, and good to soules. Oh 
that my heart were more tender, my graces stronger, my cor- 
ruptions weaker, my spirit fitter for my work, and my soul more 
endeared to my Lord, surely every new mercy lays a fresh obli- 
gation to duty, now god expects more from me than formerly, 
and oh that now since my Lord hath done so much for me, 
that I could doe something more remarkeable for my god, yea 
suffer for my Lord if he call me to it, here I am Lord, thou

about me, so that I may finish my course with joy, and the 
ministry I haue received of the Lord Jesus to testify the gospel 
of the grace of god, my life is not dear to me in comparison of 
the gospel, my great fear is lest I deny my Lord, or his truth 
in this adulterous generation, and though the most unworthy 
to doe or suffer any thing for my Lord, and as weak as any 
mortal creature for either, yet I haue given up my self wholly 
to thee, my god I am not mine own, but thine, both by crea- 
tion, redemption, possession, and my own voluntary resigna- 
tion, thine I am and tis mine honour so to be, I was devoted 
to thee by baptism, I have confirmed and ratifyed that by my 
Christian profession, and have been peculiarly set apart for 
thee in my ministerial function, thine I am by many thousands 
of obligations thou hast laid on me and that I haue laid upon 
myself to be thine in solemne days of fastings, thanksgivings, 
sacraments, and under afflictions, and upon the receit of 
mercys, and I doe not repent of this deed of gift, wch I haue 
so oft subscribed with my hand, listing my self under such a 
captain, taking on me such a warfare, no, if it were to doe 
again, I would doe it he hath requited me for all my poor 
weak service and sufferings if he never giue me more reward,

carriage, his service is perfect freedom, his work is wages, 
holines is happines, a faithfull discharge of duty brings my soul 
nearer my god, wch is my prayer its good for me to draw nigh 
to god I will call upon him as long as I liue — my greatest 
trouble is that I haue departed from my god by an evil heart of 
unbelief, haue not kept so close to god, performed my vows, 
maintained such a sense of his omnipresence, holines, power, 
acted faith, loue, self-denyal, joy in god as my soul desires I 
am really ashamed of my own folly, failings, faults, beg pardon 
in the blood of Jesus, divine assistance for future performance.

safe state god-wards, and god gaue my soul some grounded 
satisfaction. 2 then I lookt back on my life, and called to 
remembrance my sins, that 1 might spread them before the 
Lord in humiliation, and god did help me therin 3 then I 
fell down on my knees before the Lord, and reckoned up my 
several ways of breaking baptismal covenant, and god helped 
me with shame, sorrow to lament the same. 4 then I read 
1 tim 1 god helpt me to comment and apply several passages 
therof to my soul both for my humiliation and incouragmt 
then 5 fell down on my knees and pleaded covenant-grace and 
chts merits for a poor transgressour of it ; then 6 my wife 
came to me, and the rest of the time till 12 a clock, I prayd 
with her, for our poor family principally— so we went to 
dinner : 7 about 2 a clock my wife went with me into the par- 
lour, and went to pray sweetly and affectionately, and 8 I read 
for our quickening the 78 psalm wch I found suitable to the 
state of the nation : and 9 went to prayer principally for 
England, and the church of my god, wherin god helped me to 
plead till about 4 : and so at last to enter this solemne cove- 
nant with my god and write it down to be upon record for me 
or agt me : the substance I haue expressed before the Lord 
this day : 

Blessed Lord, Thou saist in thy word gather my saints to- 
ga ther those that haue made a covenant with me by sacrifice, 
my soul this day hath been endeavouring to offer up spiritual 
sacrifice, and would gladly renew my covenant with thee 
therin : help me to doe it deliberately, understandingly, uni- 
versally, and irrevocably, Lord god almighty the father of 
mercys, the fountain of beings, the autheur of all good, and 
object of our happines : my poor sinning, wondring soul — 
joyned to this sorry drossy body, hauing lived togather 52 
yeares in this world and lived on thy bounty and good plea- 
sure, and part of that time by thy grace and to thy glory, am 
abundantly satisfyed that its my duty and interest to make 
thee my utmost end and only portion, and that theres nothing 
below or besides thee in this world that can be an adequate 
satisfaction to this immortal spark, breathed into me ; 1 doe 
therefore chuse thee and thee alone to be my god, and say, 
whom have I in heaven but thee ? theres none on earth I de- 
sire in comparison of thee ! my soul will rest no where but in

thee, my happines must proceed immediatly from thee : sub- 
lunary s are transient vanitys : my soul seekes for thee, Oh 
that I could see thee, they and only they are blessed that see 
god : Lord, unite my heart to fear thy name : and cause thy 
face to shine on my soul, that it may liue in the fruition of 
thee : the Lord is my portion saith my soul therefore will I 
hope in him : And oh my dear Lord Jesus that didst take on 
thyself humane nature, didst liue and dye for me, giving thy- 
self a ransom for many, my soul desires wholly to acquiesce in 
that blessed satisfaction made to divine justice expecting 
justification and salvation therby renouncing my own right- 
eousnes as defectiue, yet filthy rags, Jehovah only is my 
righteousnes, and because I am a rebellious creature, and haue 
many strong enemys within and without, my soul takes him 
alone as my king, to make me a willing soul, subdue my lusts 
and rule me by his golden scepter Lord Jesus, put and keep 
my soul under thy government, according to scripture-laws : 
and oh that thou wouldst be my prophet to instruct me in all 
things needful to salvation by thy word and spirit, teach me 
thy way, o Lord, and lead me in thy paths, help me to learn 
of my Lord Jesus, to be meek, lowly, humble, holy, fruitful, 
faithful, profitable, and peaceble. 0 that my soul were holy, 
harmles, seperate from sinne and sinners, Lord raise my affec-

whence I am looking for a saviour take off my heart from the 
world and things below 7 : purge my soul from mine own ini- 
quity, and prepare me for glory : I dare not undertake for this 
vain, prophane, atheistical heart of mine, it hath so oft given 
me the slip, and said as that pretending son I goe sir, and 
went not, that I am afraid it may beguile me of it and undoe 
me : But oh my Lord thou hast been more faithfull to me then 
my own heart, and I humbly hope and beg thou wilst still 
stand by me in my spirituall combats, I enter the lists against 
my souls foes, flesh, world, devil, not in mine own name or 
strength for that hath fayled me, and mine enemys haue then 
made a fool of me when I haue been most confident to come 
off Victor but I am thy servant, and am about my masters 
work, and wilt thou suffer thy servant to miscarry about thy 
busines and affaires ? will not this reflect disparagement to my 
master as wel as disadvantage to me ! Him alone girdest me 
with strength to the battel, the Lord is he that teacheth my

I will not be afraid of ten thousands of people that set them- 
selves against me ronnd about for salvation belongeth unto the 
Lord tho Satan assault me, yet let me not be his slaue, tho 
world allure yet never suffer me to be insnared though sin 
haue habitation in me let it not haue dominion over me, god 
forbid I should obey the flesh in the lusts therof : Oh that my 
ways were directed to keep thy comts ! I should look on it as 
a happy state and next to heaven, though in an hell of outward 
trouble, if I might but liue without sin : oh this strength and 
guilt of sin is my hell, but since it cannot be expected 1 should 
be totally delivered, let my soul be as much freed as may be. 
Oh that I could walk with god, and keep up constant fellow- 
ship with my best friend aboue ! Lord set me at liberty, then 
shall I run the ways of thy commandments, when thou hast

It is no small content to my spirit to review the many 
solemne dedications of my self, and all I haue to the Lord by 
covenant, and the Lords gracious acceptance of me and mine, 
and his providential dispose of all I am or haue to be subser- 
vient to his glory and his churches good, particularly these 
ways — 

1 My self, soul and body, the facultys of the one, the mem- 
bers of the other, god hath ordered to be laid out for him in 
the work of the ministry, studying, preaching, praying, — and 
I can say through grace he hath helped me to meditate and 
giue my self wholly to those things 1 tim 4 15: 

2 My wife whom I haue received of god, and given back to 
god, whom god hath uot only made a meet help to me in 
civils, but in spirituals, in prayers, councels, — yea and also to 
the church, as a servant to the church, as phaebe of old was, 
Rom 16 1 : a sister as wel as a wife, 1 cor 9 5 : 

3 My two sons, whom god gaue me as pledges of loue, whom 
I haue solemnely dedicated to the Lord, who are hopefull in 
studys, in humane, divine learning, are helped to pray, are 
brought up at the feet of a learned Gamaliel,* in academical

of it for publick service, my study is my work-house, my par- 
lour is retiring room for such as are not well, my house is the

6 My horse is in some sort imployed (though more remotely) 
in a subserviency to gods work, in carrying me up and down 
to preach the gospel, he hath been a faithful willing servant 
now 7 about 12 yeares, (I had him of my own dear deceased 
brother John june 24 1662 that same year we were silenced) 
he hath carryed me chearfully many thousand miles to preach 
the gospel : Act 23 24 : 

7 My estate, incomes, goods are all in a subserviency to 
spritual uses, my plate, cups, flagons for the administering the 
supper, and chaires, stooles — for people to sit on : tables, for 
writers, mony, meal, meat to giue to the poor, and entertain- 
ment of gods people on fast-days, thanksgivings, wherin god 
helpes me — according to my ability, the rest goes to supply my 
family at home and my sons abroad, and god wonderfully 
makes out, according to phi 4 19 — 

So that tis no smal comfort to me that my god hath put 
me into a capacity to be serviceable to him with what he hath 
given me, so that holines to the Lord is (in a sort) writ on bels 
of horses, pots — Zech 14 20 21 : 

Moreover, to my comfort, god hath accepted of aboue 12 lis 
worth of goods that I took for preaching the gospel, being 
plundred, an high honour indeed ! — this writ Jan 3 1674-5

TEMPTATIONS.

1 On munday Decemb 15 73 we had a private fast at Will 
Hurds, wherin we had a good day and I being the last at 
prayer my heart was exceedingly warmed, but immediately 
wn I was got off my knees, there was a discourse started 
amongst us about a difference in civil affairs about a trespasse 
betwixt two Christians R R and J K the former being with us 
censured the other exceedingly, calling him knave, my spirit 
was something stirred, and I was in some passion, we had a 
sharp dispute, wherin I obserue the hand of Satan to render 
our meeting unprofitable, and parting uncomfortable I thought 
I did well in my reproof, but my spirit was too warm, yet he 
took it well after a while, and thankt me for my admonition at 
parting, and I hear since is now inclinable to reconciliation : 
blessed be god : it may be Satan must be outshot in his own 
bow : god grant it : 

2 On Lords day morning Jan 4 1673-4 my maid went to 
water my horse, and she found a peece of the wall pulled 
down, and stones got round about it, and a stile made over out 
of the lane into my croft, I went to it, and found myself a 
little moved, I pull’d up the stile, and cast a few stones in the 
place, — it was some discomposure to my spirit, partly bee I 
knew it was done out of malice, there being a better way in 
the lane then field, partly bee I had planted an orchyard, where 
they design to goe, and though there hath been long since a 
way there, crossing the crofts, yet it hath not been used of 
many yeares, god left me to some passion, tho I blesse god it 
hindred not my Lords day work — 

3 On Thuesday Jan 27 1673-1 my house was paved, my 
heart was too much gone out after, the conveniency and neat- 
nes of my habitation, I mispent too much time in looking at 
the workmen, I begun to please my self in worldly accommo- 
dations, herin I was very sensible of a temptation at night in 
family-prayer I judged myself in confessing sin, god sweetly 
inlarged my heart to giue up house and all I had to him, and 
oh what a melting duty was it, my heart freely resigned up all 
I haue, if he call me to leaue all by death, banishmt, imprison- 
ment, confiscation, &amp;c. I hope I can say truely I am as wil- 
ling to part with all for my Lords sake or for his pleasure as 
ever I received it : blessed be god that this temptation ended 
with a conquest :

4 on thursday April 23 1674 preaching at Lassel-hall, with 
Mr. Richardson, he had sent to desire me to write to Mr 
frankland, to entertain his sons with mine, I had given a hint 
rather agt it, having had experience that they had done my 
lads no good but hurt at Mr Hickmans for I had no mind they 
should goe with them, Mr R — told me he had been himself 
at Mr franklands house in the north the week before, and I 
got a conceit in my mind that they had told him what I had 
writ rather agt it, and that wch confirmed me was I thought 
Mr Rich : carryed more strangely then formerly, and had no 
mind to talk of the busines,— and then I had a world of mis- 
givings in my mind, and thought he chose the 62 ps to be 
sung agt me for perfidiousnes, and oh what a cutting distrac- 
tion was it to my spirit ! I would haue given a great; deal I 
had not writ any thing, oh I thought what a sad thing that I 
should be unfaithful to such persons as had been such friends 
to me. however my intent might be good,— when I came 
home, the morning after, god broke my heart to peeces,— 
melted me helped me to plead on my face, that was a real 
mercy, though it may be the ground of it was but a conceit — 
indeed it was no more. 

5 On munday Aug 17 1674 keeping house most of the day, 
I was ingaged in reading Steidans commentarys, and tho I had 
motions to goe to prayer in my study yet being busy I put it 
off, so was called to supper — then we went to prayer, while we 
were reading I H of Hal : comes for the Lords rent, wn I was 
kneeled down to prayer J priestley of York called at gates, 
would sit on horsback till I had done prayer tho it rained fast, 
my wife stands by me to signify her desire to haue me break 
off, I did giue over,— it troubled me, I went to my study, fell 
on my knees god was withdrawn. I went into the house went 
again to family-prayer still I found my heart dull, and again 
with my wife, still it would not doe, in the morning god made 
my soul some amends in my study, oh what quiekeniugs did 
my heart feel 1 tho god correct our sluggishnes yet he returnes 
to diligent seekers : Lord pardon sloth— 

6 on Wednesday Sept 16 1674 I kept a day of publick 
thankfulnes, Mr Dawson preacht after me god helpt him he 
preacht exceeding wel, god also helpt my heart sweetly in 
praying and preaching, but I found workings of pride, envy, 
in my spirit, especially observing J P writing his sermon not

mine, R H staying while he preachd leaving my sermon, J B 
commending his sermon exceedingly I found the workings of a 
base naughty heart, oh that god would humble me for pride 
envy, and teach me to blesse god for others gifts and useful- 
nes — Lord help— 

7 Octob 2 74 I was at Isaac Balmes at a day of thanks- 
giving, I prayed, preacht, baptized the child, ther was John 
Balme, Jame* Jewet, John Taylour, being members of the 
church at little Horton, they joyned with us in prayer, praise, 
but when I baptized the child they all went out. I was much 
offended thereat, resolved to examine their reasons, but Mar- 
garet Hodgson prevented me desiring me not to take offence 
at it, wch guided me, but I confesse I found the faylings of 
spirit upon that occasion. Lord forgiue — 

8 On Saturday night Octob 31 74 I dreamed in the night 
of my being with Joseph Crowther, (who hath got the way 
over my croft proved a mock at Brighouse court, Octob 23) 
and after my dream lay waking in the night tormenting myself 
about this way, could not get any good thoughts into my mind 
in the morning still I was full of needles useles self-perplexing 
thoughts, at last I got into my study— fell down on my knees, 
a pretty while I was distracted— at last god came in, and oh 
what a melting season had I ! I was got presently aboue ways 
and stiles as high as heaven and then god helpt my heart to 
lay and leaue all matters with him, and plead with him for 
soules and I cannot say that that worldly affair came into my 
heart all that day, wch was Nov 1 74 blessed be god for this 
conquest : 

9 Novemb 12 I was sent for to come to Eliz Pierson at 
Wood-side, so I went to visit her found her not sensible, 
almost distracted yet speaking now and then a sensible word, 
amongst which she said before us all, doe you not see a whores 
forehead ? at another time (wn none but she and I were in 
the room) she sd my sins haue made me mad. I askt her what 
sins? she said, lust,— I then began to deal with her, tho not 
so plainly and faithfully as I ought, but my great sin was that 
the young man was there, who is reported to haue lyen with 
her, he helpes her, calls her loue as tho she was his wife, yet I 
did not deal with him about it, tho I had both special reason, 
obligation, and oppertunity so to have done. Lord forgiue 
this sin : wn I came home at night I was pressed with the

guilt of this neglect, set myself to prayer, self-examination, but 
god did sadly with-draw— I strove but no good could I doe— 
and alas was forced to leaue my heart dull, hard, distracted, oh 
for softning grace ! 

10 Thursday Jan 28 75 having my mind intent upon my 
study on a subject I went to it, stuck at till dinner, and had 
all morning put off my duty of secret prayer, god knoweth, and 
in the afternoon went to visit a yong man in a feavre that I 
found very selfish, and tho I spake good words in discourse 
and prayer, yet my heart was not affected, at night came home 
— but god was withdrawn, I had much struggling, fell all along 
yet could not find it in that frame I desired— tho god came in 
a little in the close of that work. Lord, forgiue my sinful 
omissions— 

11 Tuesday feb 9 1675 (being invited to preach at the new 
meeting-place at Leeds) I set from home had studyed (as I 
conceived) a good sermon, and pleased my self in imagining 
what an auditory I should have the day after, wt content I 
should give to good people, how seasonable the text and sub- 
ject would be being Rev. 2 4 5 of leaving first loue, and, 
removing candlestick, there being danger of it, as I rode over 
Hardger moore I checkt and challenged my self for these proud 
conceits, told the Lord how just he should be, and endeavoured 
to work my heart to content, if he should prevent my preaching 
it, or send indeed men to disturb, or shame me by withdrawing 
from me— when I came as far as Morley I met A L a friend 
on the road, who shewed me the kings order for recalling 
licences and suppressing meetings — and when I came to Leeds 
we had a meeting at Mr. Strettons house to consult about my 
preaching, Mr Thorsby, Mr Dickson, M Hickson, Mr Wilson, 
Mr Ibison, Mr Milner, &amp;c did all judg it expedient to forbear 
partly bee it was an order and so in force as soon as published 
without proclamation, partly bee of the Aldermens rage being 
exasperated, by the nonconformists conflict with them and 
conquest of them but especially because they had told the 
mayor and aldermen that if the k called in licenses they would 
cease— so I forbore preaching in publick, yet preacht my ser- 
mon in private at Mr Strettons house that night— was helpt

to be a little affected in meditation, laid my hat aside, was a 
falling to it, suddenly a thought came into my head of some- 
thing that I must write down of my sermon wch I did, and 
one thing begot more, so that I spent the time in writing, — so 
went to prayer in my family and supped, and tho god did 
sweetly assist me in family-prayer, yet when I went to my 
study again, and fel to prayer god was withdrawn, sadly and 
sensibly gone, I strove and struggled with my self but could 
doe no good, a good while my heart was hard, dead, distracted, 
I could get no quickenings, afterwards I left my study and 
work, exceedingly troubled, walkt up into my orchyard, in my 
house of office fell down on my knees, there god sweetly met 
my heart with some meltings — blessed be god : Lord teach me 
hereafter not to put off duty or to quench the motions of thy 
blessed spirit : 

13 on Tuesday June 1 75 coming to my sister Ester White- 
heads they told me that my cozen Richard Heywoods son, 
John, was dead but about half an hour before, he had never 
been wel since his fathers death, wch was about a month 
before and then the devil and my own covetous heart began to 
raise unworthy musings and agitations for though my father 
be aliue, yet after his death I am the next heir to that estate, 
being worth 20 li a year, my brother John Hey wood being 
eldest dyed beyond the seas, his son Richard being also dead, 
and his grandson John being now dead, its intailed upon the 
heires maile, and I being next was too apt to please myself 
with the injoyment of it after my fathers death who is almost 
80 years of age, its true I did pray and seem to condole with 
the young widow, but as god knows I found self-pleasing 
self-flattering thoughts of the in joying of it, but on Wednesday 
morning, at my brother Okeys my heart was in some measure 
helped in prayer for those thoughts, and god did help me then 
to despise the world, and the Loud met me that day in public 
ordinances : 

14 June 10 1679 I was guilty of an oversight being at Mr 
Boys (a merchants house in Wakefield) Mr Kerby told me he 
had good news for me, wch was work at Mr Naylours on

mitted, on the tuesday night I visited Mr Hauden, he invited 
me to preach there in his room, and Mr. Nay lour sent me a 
note to invite me, I accepted of it, and stayd. Mr Kerby was

preaching wn I came thither. I went to work, god helpt, but 
I had done betwixt one and two, being to goe to Leeds after, 
suddenly I pronounced the blessing, when the people were 
gone Mr Nay lour told me they purposed to hold on the work : 
others should have been excersised, some disappointed, their 
meat was not ready, it was wrong, I was troubled, fretted at 
it that night, so did they as I suppose, it was designed for a 
day of fasting and prayer, wch I did not understand, the blame 
was laid on me, tho indeed they should haue given me an hint 
— alas I was troubled that so good a work should be so un- 
happily interrupted : Lord pardon me — * 

15 july 23 1675, in the morning came Martha Tetley my 
old servant to me, and told me reports were spread abroad as 
though she had been unfaithful to me — and told me there are 
some persons that use to come to our meeting have been guilty 
of divulging that report, and desired she might have liberty to 
speak in the close of the day to see who would testify such a 
thing to her face, — I condescended, after I had concluded, I 
mentioned the case, askt them particularly whether they could 
charge her with any such thing, they answered negatively, wn 
I came to grace Butler, she sd she could not charge her with 
unfaithfulnes in her hand, but in her tongue she could, — so 
they began and fell to proving tales, and contradicting one 
another — so that I had much adoe to quiet them, alas, it was a 
sad close of a fast, there was unseemly words, spirits up, much 
passion — Lord humble and pardon that — I fear it was not 
regular for it should have been done privately — 

16 May 5 1 676 being at Mr. John Brooksbanks at a private 
day at night at supper we had occasion to discourse about 
degrees in the university, upon occasion of my sons going into 
Scotland. Mr Whithead argued agt all degrees saying the 
pope advanced by those steps into the chaire I argued to con- 
trary he grew hotter, and sd J abhorre all such degrees my 
spirit also grew warm, and I sd I abhorre all such principles, 
we argued hotly, I confesse my spirit was a little too much 
moved, considering 1 the slight occasion of difference, 2 the 
busines we had been about, and warm affections, god had 
stirred in my heart immediately before, 3 the company that 
was then present, Lord pardon the workings of passion and 
perversenes —

messenger to acquaint us that 3 men were coming to appre- 
hend me, I knew not wt to doe but dismist the congregation, 
many went home, I withdrew to Will. Clays, there was 
cowardice and pusillanimity, Mr Dawson was bolder, its true 
after those men were gone by, I mustered up my company, and 
went to our work, and I preacht, but found my spirit discom- 
posed, then we dined, designing to preach at 4 a clock, but 
people hanged about all that time, many people stayed, and 
waited that houre, but some sd they were watching, and thought 
there was danger in it — so I forbore that night to preaeh, but 
when they were gone my heart was shut up much hardened, 
god did apparently withdraw, and I was much afflicted in my 
spirit, that I had not preacht. Oh what a distracting sabboth 
was it, and a disappointment ! god had a hand in it, but I 
saw my weaknes in it, and desire repentance, and pardon, and 
assistance for future, yet monday morning god melted my 
heart for these things. 

18 Aug 14 1G76 I was at the funerall of old Rich : Boocock 
— after the drinking at Stump-cross, a company of fellows 
would needs drink 2d a peece, I sate down with them, and 
though I did not drink, yet I did not appear so much as I 
ought agt their vain way of drinking shots, I saw some lay at 
it busily, and strove to drink, I left them at it, and am afraid 
many of them will get too much — I am conscious to myself 
I was not so faithfull to my god as I ought, though I did say 
something to dissuade them from intemperance. — Lord pardon. 

19 Sept 20 76 I was at Mr Sharpes solemne day of thank- 
fulnes to god for his wiues deliverance, my heart was dull

put on Mr Whitehurst to prayer, he prayed long, then Mr 
Sharp fel to preaching continued till after 5 a clock, it grew 
late, 1 and my wife were to come home I was restles, and 
fretted, found my spirit in an ill frame. 1 I chaft agt such as 
prayd thought they were dull impertinent, spending much time

20 Dec 27 1676 being to preach at Morley the remainder of 
Mr Baylys funeral sermons, lodging all night at John Brooks- 
banks, the clerk came in the morning to consult about ringing 
&amp;c they told me Mr Root had given notice of his preaching on 
m on day being that called Chtmas day, but neither Lords day 
nor monday had given notice of my preaching on Wednesday, 
I was offended thought they did it on purpose that I might 
have lese company, here was one temptation but wn I saw they 
flockt in abundantly, and a multitude came, more than ordi- 
nary then I found my temptation to pride, vain-glory, and wn 
I perceived none of Mr Marsdens church coming, lest they 
should seem to countenance the keeping of this time, herein I 
had a temptation to be offended also, tho they kept a private 
fast that day — oh wt adoe haue I with a naughty heart ! 

21 Jan 6 77 at night after I was gone to bed, at my first 
sleep, I had a terrible dream concerning my son John, that he

dreadful apprehension till almost 2 a clock, and was ready to 
faint under it, oh what a night had I ! at last god gave me 
power to resist it, I fell asleep, slept quietly till morning, and

carry her and goe with them to Ratchdal, it stuck so close to 
my spirit that it went to bed with me, rose with me. I was

oh what a wretch am I ! 

22 June 6 1677 keeping a solemne fast at Wyke, preaching 
and praying affectionately, tho my heart was warmed yet my 
body was disordered, as usually it is after a solemne fast-day, 
for upon such days laying out myself more then ordinary in 
pleading with god, weeping and extending my spirits usually 
the morning after I am violently assaulted with a sad fit of 
head-ach, being now not so well able to abide it as I haue been, 
whereupon I haue a temptation to abate and remit of my zeal 
and fervency in devotion, and to be more moderate as I see 
others are, and that word comes in oft I will haue mercy and 
not sacrifice, but when I consider of the saints weeping, pour- 
ing out their soules like water before the Lord, crying mightily, 
effectual fervent prayers, being in an agony in the duty, and 
withall consider the curse upon these that doe the work of the 
Lord negligently, I dare not doe otherwise, if god help, what- 
ever becomes of this poor carcasse — 

23 on Lords day Aug 5 1677 I was to preach at Leeds for 
Mr Streaton, and preaching in the forenoon at Mr Elk : Hick- 
sons, there was a great number, upon wch my heart was some- 
thing puffed up, but in the afternoon at the new meeting-place 
multitudes came, still my spirit was too highly exalted, with 
vain popular applause, they sd there was more then had been 
seen in it, since it was built, on munday god helped to frame a 
letter to Mr Streaton, at a meeting to wch they subscribed, 
wch I thought was well done, still I was the more advanced 
with high conceits of myself, many also came to see me, several 
invited me to their houses to dinner, and then upon the Wed- 
nesday at lecture there was a great assembly of all sorts pres- 
biterian, independent, prelatical, Anabaptist of all sorts, strange 
faces, that never were there before, W H being an Anab : being 
askt how he likt me ans : who can chuse but like him well, he 
is a wel-accomplisht man these things coming to my eye and 
ear did too much tickle me with vain-glorious conceits of my 
self, so that I came home on thursday big swollen with over- 
weening thoughts, but reflecting on it the morning after in my 
retirements, I fell down on my knees, and humbled my self for 
the pride of my heart, as Hezekiah, 2 chron 32 26 — god debased 
me in my own eyes, oh what a wretch am I, that can be so 
soon swelled with popular applause, Lord pardon me — and for

all that admiration not all those people at that rich place 
bestowed so much as a penny on me, except one woman (once 
a house-fellow with me) that gave me half-a crown god seeing 
it not ht that I should liaue both profit and honour at once, 
lest I should be exalted aboue measure, withall convincing me 
how little available vulgar praise is towards necessary supplys 
— but no matter of either — so that good may be done — 

24 Saturday night octob 27 1677 lying waking in my bed, I 
had abundance of vain roving distracting thoughts the occasion 
was this my sons brought two horses out of Scott, we had made 
a shift to keep them in summer and had made exchange of two. 
yet I had 3 and could not sell one, I was perplext, knew net 
what to doe with them all, one while fretting that nobody 
would buy, and again torturing my self that I had parted with 
my old horse, trifling busineses had begot great distractions, 
kept me waking some hours, to little purpose, profit, oh how 
little able was I to gather in my thoughts or to fix them on goed 
objects. — Lord pardon wt are poor wormes, wn god leaues — it was 
an ill preparative for sabboth ensuing, oh for humbling grace • 

25 On thursday feb 7 1677-8 there was several friends kept 
a day of prayer at James Holsteds for him and his wife, they 
being marryed the day before, god graciously helped J B in 
prayer, my heart was much melted, immediately after I went to 
prayer ; and being to goe away, the wife and maids passed 
through the room where we were into the buttery, preparing 
meat, I was upon my knees distracted and much troubled with 
those passing to and fro, it workt upon my spirit, I could net 
goe on, but hem’d beckoned my wife and desired her to tel, 
Anne to joyne with us for I would not eat, so they came in, 
but this troubled me — Lord pardon, the day after at my house 
in a fast immediately after I was begun, such a thought waa 
foysted in, but god gave me victory, blessed be god — 

26 on friday feb 15 78 we had a private fast for the nation 
at Mr Dawsons, when J K and J B were excercised I thought 
they prayd not so profitably, suitably affectionately as I desired, 
and having Mr Jenners book of Wilf impenitency in my pocket 
I read in it while they were at prayer, but god much withdrew 
from me in the conclusion of the work, wn I was excersisec!, 
and herein god was righteous, my conscience smites me, Lord 
humble me, help agt such a base slight, censurant, hypocritical 
spirit for the future — oh how little good are we like to doe the kinp -

27 Of late I haue had more to doe about matriuloniall cases 
then 1 haue been concerned in all my life before in the time as 
to advice, &amp;c this is March 20 1678 : viz

greg writ to me for an account of him, because he makes suit 
to her daughter, she is to haue a great portion tis sd 2,000li — 
she ordered me to send my letter by him, I did so, and writ a

was afraid he might open the letter and turn my enemy — I am 
afraid I failed— Lord humble me—

where Mr Milner, Mr. Johnson prayd Mr Cotes and I preacht, 
and prayed, being reserved to be the last, and they leaving me but 
little time, whereas I had much to speak, my spirit was moved, 
and I was tempted to think they spent not the time so profitably 
as my naughty heart imagined I could haue done, but they 
carryed on the work profitably — only my pride and the applause 
of several lifted me up, and I confesse the day after at Mr 
Roots, where he and I preacht, I had the like vain and vaunting 
risings of heart — Lord humble me for the pride of my heart, — 
possibly I doe wel (yet why should I say, tis I, and not rather 
the grace of god thats with me), but pride is in danger to 
marre and fly-blow all : oh that pardoning grace may cover 
and awe all I need it : 

29 On Lords day may 12 1678 my wages was collected, and 
I took it up into my study that evening, and had an itching 
much to see what was brought, I begun to count the money, 
reckon it up, set it down, and order it, I did it with some 
hesitancy, yet went on, my conscience accused me of breaking 
the sabboth thereby, I was ashamed god helpt me to repent of 
that sin, and resolue by his grace to doe so no more, remem-

OBSERVABLE PROVIDENCES 

RELATING TO OTHERS. 

There was one Capt : Clark that lived in London in the sick- 
nes time came down to Nottingham, where he dyed, left a wife 
and son, his wife is marryed again, the son hath been some- 
thing unruly, addicted to vain expences, had used to steal 
tobacco out of his own fathers shop in London, and sell it to 
maintain his prodigality — his father in law sent him to school 
to a non-conformist minister, about 4 miles off — the master 
after a while saw his wild courses, endeavoured to rectify him, 
but could not, sent for his father in law to come over, he told 
him he must take his son home again, for he could doe no good 
with him, he intreated him to let him stay a while longer, make 
further tryal, he yielded, but the boy was dissatisfyed, bee he 
got not mony enough to spend, light of Dr faustus-book, found 
his way of getting wealth by a covenant with the devil, got the 
words of the contract there expresst, went to the back-side of 
the orchard one evening, graved the words on a pale with his 
knife, sprinkled his blood in the letters, and subscribed his 
name — went in, slept little, was troubled at what he had done, 
rose early in the morning, thinking to cut out the letters, but 
coming thither the pale was gone, he was more affrighted, kept 
solitary, sitting in his chamber, a motion comes into his mind, 
to rise and walk out to such a back-lane, he did so, there he 
met the devil with a bag of mony, who sd pretty youth, wt 
aileth thee to be so sad ? thou art kept short, and its pitty thou 
hast not mony to spend but giue thy soul to me and thou shalt 
haue mony enough, and I know thou art troubled in thy learn- 
ing, but thou shalt be the best scholar in the schoole, and able 
to teach thy master, — the boy was sore affrighted, said nothing, 
but offered to goe away, the devil called again and askt him 
what he would doe, at last the boy sd he would consider of it, 
the devil would giue him a sign, and told him as he went up 
starres into his chamber if he laid down one shilling, he should 
take up two, wch the boy tryed, keeping his eye upon it, and 
took up two, the devils shilling he resolved to spend first to try 
if it was good mony, and it went current, but the boy begun to 
be troubled, told his master the whole story his master sent for 
his father, the father came not, but sd its but some of his old 
tricks, the master sent again, signifying that it was an extra- 
ordinary case, he came, the youth down on his knees and told

all, desired their help, prayers —the boy reformed exceedingly, 
prayed much, one night was praying, the devil came, bad him 
giue over, he would not, the devil threatened to bring the pale, 
he prayed still, leaning on his bed-side, the bed lifted up 
leisurely till it was beyond his reach, he then rose up, opened 
his bible at gen. 3 the seed of the woman — shal — laid it on the 
bedside, the bed came gradually down again he fell to his prayers, 
is very penitent, expresseth his great desires to be a minister. 

1 that he may glorify god as he hath much dishonoured him. 

2 bee he hath a sufficient estate to maintain him (having 140li 
per an) that he need not be under temptations in that calling 
— this Story Mr Whitehurst a non-conformist minister told at 
flansit — having had it from good hands at Nottingham, him- 
self — Mtris prudence Hatfield sth since that she heard this 
youth preach in a private-meeting in Nottingham, since Mical- 
mas — he is not yet seventeen yeares of age, — 1672 : this story 
is further confirmed, and at this instant june 18 1674 he is a 
preacher towards york, an eminent man, but is much troubled 
about the pale, that was taken away. 

2 On Thuesday, shroue-tide so called, at York the prentices of 
the city being at liberty for recreation plaid in the minster- 
yard, throwing at a cock, just before Dr Lakes door, the Dr in 
a rage went out to them, told them they should not play there, 
they told him they would, he in anger struck at some of them, 
broke their heads, the boys were in a rage at him again, tore 
his goun off* his back, into several peeces, hanged some parts on 
a pole, and cryed out, who wil list themselues under the black 
colours ! they presently increased to a multitude, went to the 
house, broke doun glasses standens, made a fair entrance into 
the house, and defaced it, that its judged 20 li will not repair 
it as it was, they entertained them friendly in the house, fetcht 
them bear, but that would not serue they wanted the Doctor, 
but his wife had loekt him up in a chamber, — he sent to the 
Lord mayor, and governour, who sent souldiers but they durst 
not attempt to meddle with them only intreated them to scatter, 
wch they did after they had rallyed a while, this was feb 11, 
and upon friday feb 14 the boys got again into the minster- 
yard, just before Dr Lakes door, and there strolled out amain, 
and provoked him or any other to disturb them, but all was 
quiet — an ill omen — 1672-3 

3 Mr R Longley of Priestley being very sick they sent for

me to come visit him twice one Lords day, viz feb 16 72-3 
I went timely in the morning, and after preaching at night 
prayed with him both times, for he was very ill, and as was 
judged near death, then prayed and religion was good, but upon 
tlmesday following when I went again, he was much better, in 
hopes of recovery, and wn I then tryd to speak of spiritual 
things it would not down, he was sleepy or heedles, I was not 
then desired to pray or praise god with him, formerly in his 
sicknes, (well haue been many of late) he had more sensible 
expressions and peremptory resolutions of reformation then now : 
in this sicknes he hath been wonderful stupid and indeed (as 
al say) it was a sad surfet got with sore drinking, for he hath 
been a man of great strength in drinking sack, brandy, strong 
waters, and ale, particularly a while agoe one Mr Hawkins inn- 
keeper at the star in Wakefield and he had a sore fit of drink- 
ing and falling out that Hawkins is dead, since, upon it, wch 
affrighted this his companion, — and it seemes he* is better but 
I can see little hopes of a better spirit or life, sometimes god 
reserues from a lesser death and judgment to a sadder and more 
remarkable, as Lots wife, — I fear the effect of this from pro 29 
1 : he is a man of great trading and vast wealth and I am 
afraid of much guilt — god hath heard prayer for him in re- 
covery— oh that he would also hear for working grace ! 

4 Dr Hook desiring me to let him haue a sight of my 
licences I consented and sent them to him by Jonathan 
Priestley, who made scruples and pickt quarrels, but seeing that 
w T ould doe no good, he said tell Mr Heywood I want my dues 
for 9 or 10 yeares last past, likewise he spoke of the same to 
John Stancliffe, accordingly I sent J. S to him, who upon mun- 
day march 31 73 went to him to pay Easter reckonings, he 
laid down 5s, the Dr toll him it was not three fines that wrnuld 
satisfy, they then fell to reckoning and it came to 7sh for 11 
yeares so he paid him but togather therwith they had abun- 
dance of arguing and hot disputes about all things — the Dr told 
him I had not curam animarum, that I had nothing to doe to 
preach, if I would preach I must goe into the mountains, or 
plantations where there was need for tlieres no need here, that 
we set up altar against altar, made separations, rendered their 
preaching contemtible what we could, sd the church of Engl 
had been sufficiently indicated, my friend askt him wt he 
meant by the church of England : he answ : all but the papists

and separatists, — he told many egregious lyes agt us, as that 
we would not hear them, or if we did it was to catch, that in 
my meeting-place some walked, others talked, others slept, &amp;c 
I may say the Lord rebuke this accuser of brethren — 

Mr Horton having erected a meeting-place in Sower by and I 
having procured a licence for it, he desired me to begin the 
worke of a weekly lecture there on thuesday May 6 73 wch 
accordingly I did, he purposing to haue the help of 4 of us, Mr 
Bentley, Mr Dawson, Mr Root and my self, I preacht on that 
text psal 86 wit shew me a token for good &amp;c the Lord did 
affect many hearts wch was a token for good, but satan is busy 
when any good work is carryed on, Dr Hook of Halifax was 
much offended, and the Saturday following sent Mr Horton this 
following letter — Sr I hoped to liaue met you with your minister 
on Wednesday at our church and after with your brethren the 
feofee of Mr Nathaniel Waterhouse at the lecturers house, but 
I suppose you were so full with the 4 houres exceroise at the 
dedication of your new-built cottage (as you formerly calld it, 
now turn’d into a synagogue,) that you could not digest the 
prayers of our church and a sermon there the next day, had I 
seen you then or foreseen your designed meeting, I should haue 
been so bold (as my pastoral duty binds me) to haue asked 
your autority, to that end I was to wait on you at your inn 
to day, but you being gone home I sent after you this mes- 
senger, on the same errand, if you haue autority, I desire you 
to shew it, and that before the next meeting (wch I hear is on 
thuesday next) and I haue done, if you haue not I require you 
to desist, your act (however you judg it) being a sin, a scandal, 
a scliisme, a danger, and so you will find perhaps sooner then 
you expect : if you shal please in thankfulnes to god who hath 
increased your estate to express your pious charity you may doe 
it more piously in making an addition to the chappel of 
Sowerby : I giue you this timely intimation and caution in 
Christian charity and expect your present answer : 

5 this honest gentleman being a member of our society and 
the Supper-day being the day after, at night after all was done 
he read this letter, craved our advice, we thought it was best to 
shew his licence to justice farrar, and to send him the answer 
which he had writ and shewed us, on munday, it was indeed a 
very sober Christian answer to so angry a letter giving him an 
account of the reason of his not meeting the feofees, because

there was no meeting appointed by the steward, and it was not 
the quarter-day, telling him of gods command for preaching the 
word in season and out of season and of the kings indulgence 
and particular license for that place, withall professing that 
what he did was neither in opposition to or pro ju lice of pub- 
lick ordinances upon the Lords day, to well he bore a due 
reverence, and at wch he gaue attendance, but it was to redeem 
a little time for gods service and the good of soules according 
to liberty graunted and withall saying, that if he rightly con- 
sidered the great abounding of sin, and necessity of sinners, he 
would see a need of obeying that command, cry aloud, spare 
not, lift up thy voyce like a trumpet and shew my people their 
transgression and the house of Jacob their sin, and would 
thank god for such as would help in that good work : — this is 
the substance of the letter he designed to send him how it 
will take god knows but ceartainly he hath little reason to find 
fault with his slighting of the public ordinance, for as he at- 
tends dayly these at Sowerby (except when he comes perhaps 
once a moneth to us) so he is not behind only in contribution, 
giving Mr Booker minister there 8 li per annum : and besides 
he giues lOsh a sermon to the ministers that preach this lecture 
in the new meeting-place : blessed be god that hath raised up 
any to consult and promote the welfare of soules in so evil a 
time, and let the good hand of our god be upon us for good, 
that they may not cause us to cease, we wait upon god for the 
result of these affaires our dear brother Mr Dawson is to preach 
there this day, being May 13 1673 : he preacht quietly and so 
did Mr Root, Mr Bentley, myself again and so it continues yet 
successively.

provided Mr Wood of Rippenden to preach for him, but Mr

prayd not but bid-prayer (as they call it) i e doe you pray for

fairfax ; they had given the Duke the new common-prayer- 
book, and old Gill the reader had an old one, wherin Mary Q 
mother was, Gill read on, and prayd for her tho dead, wch the 
D made a jest of in the afternoon he would not goe to church 
again, but towards night walkt up to the gibbet that people 
might see him, he lodged two nights at Dr Maudes, the town 
made a collection aud bore his charges there he inquired if 
there was any non-conformists therabouts the Dr ans yes many 
he told him it was the kings pleasure they should haue their 
liberty.— Mr Bentley being with Lord Henry fairfax told him 
of several of Dr Hookes expressions from pulpit agt the non- 
conf- (as that they murdered the king &amp;c wch I haue by me 
in writing) my Ld told him he was heartily sorry the Dr was 
not at home, for his grace would haue given him a rebuke, as 
indeed he did Mr Cook at Leeds who complaining of fanaticks 
meetings, the D. broke out into a passion, and swearing, bid- 
ding him be gone, he had nothing to doe with either of them, 
but to get souldiers for his majesty — the like was his carriage 
towards them at York, and wn they were long in their latter 
service and organs playing he pluckt up and left them before 
they had done and went his way — he got some hundreds of 
souldiers in Yorkshire as other Ld Liuetenants did in other 
countys, and they are all to meet at a generall Rendezvous 
upon Black-heath, where they haue built tents, and there the 
king is to view them but what use must be made of them, god 
knows, ceartain it is we haue had a dreadful fight with the 
Hollanders at sea upon Wednesday june 4 wherin multitudes of 
men were slain on both sides, and abundance of wounded men 
are come into our harbours, theres further resolutions for war, 
Lord cease this bloodshed among protestants I may say as —

it broke the clock, rumbled terribly in the church so that the 
congregation made a tumult to get out at the church-doores, 
and were driven on heapes with striving, there was sad confu- 
sion, I cannot yet learn a full account of the particulars of it, 
but I am credibly informed that Mr Parker and Mr Stringer

such as haue any office or places of trust civil or military, shall 
receive the sacramt in their parish church according to the 
custom of the church of England wch shal be signifyed by cer- 
tificate and witnesses &amp;c the justices of peace at the next quarter 
sessions, where they goe also to take the oaths of allegiance 
and supremacy : Now there is at Halifax a free school that 
hath an ancient charter from Queen Elizab. and it seemes its 
lately renewed, for this school there are 12 governours, Dr 
Hook, Mr Horton of Sowerby, Mr Jonathan Hall, Mr Sam : 
Lister of Shibden-hall, Mr Robt Ramsden of Stony-royd, Mr 
Henry Ramsden of Ealand hall, Mr Danl Greenwood : &amp;c — 
these had notice to be at the sacrament at Halifax june 29 73 : 
but the day before being Saturday they met to consult what to 
doe, and though several of them resolved to be at sacramt, yet 
not upon that account as governours to get certificates for their 
receiving, Mr Horton, and some others were glad they were so 
unanimous, for they were resolved not to goe upon others 
accounts,— so they forbare — yet there were some that must goe 
upon other accounts as officers, as (I suppose) Mr farrar jus- 
tice of peace, Dr Maud master of the chancery, his brother Mr 
Samuel Maud an attorney, Mr John Richardson, and some 
others. When the Dr was administring the sacramt, he went 
up to the high altar, or communion table within the railes in 
the chancel, and ordered the dark John Wilson to give notice, 
that whosoever expected Certificates must come and kneel at 
the outside of the railes and so receive the Sacramt, — they sate 
still and offered not to goe, notice was given agen, then they 
went up- some say about seven persons, and so received, but 
as they say little fit for such a work being in a confusion, and 
being trepan’d to it, — Dr Maud sth the devil himself could not 
hane invented a more politick fetch to cheat them : — but Dr 
Hook is much offended at the governours of the school for not 
coming to, or not coming up at it to the railes the day after they 
had a meeting at the freeschool but he would not come — what the 
issue therof will be, god knows — but the Dr preachtat a strange 
rate that day agt preaching in houses, utterly condemning it, say- 
ing it was a dishonour to the gospel that its preacht in houses :

peece of Rosemary, and paire of gloues, contrary to the custome 
of our country, wch did not please our people, they had given 
them notice to come at ten a clock, had the sermon at three, 
Dr Hook preacht, commended her highly, but especially for 
receiving the sacrament at his hands upon her sick-bed, after 
Avch sd he her doubts vanished, her feares Avere dispelled, her 
heart satisfyed, and comforts restored — how she came on to 
these principles and practices I knoAv not, but sure I am she 
ay as not long agoe of a different mind, when she sate down with 
us at the Sacramt at Coley-liall, and travelled before that into 
Lane to Denton to receiue it, and was exceedingly prejudiced 
agt the vicar, talkt much agt him, though I did not like that 
— I guesse Mr Jonathan Hall and her daughter Betty Brigs, 
being late got strong converts to the prelaticall Avay, had great 
influence upon the old Avoman, — she had taken much pleasure 
in buildings, orchards, gardens, &amp;c— but is gone, hath left all

13 On Wednesday night Sept 10 and thursday Sept 11 1673 
there was the greatest flood that ever was known in the memory 
of man, it hath broken and taken away many bridges, as Otley 
great bridg, Colne, midle-bottomes, &amp;c it hath reckt and car-

of James Brookesbanks going for bark upon friday near 
Huthersfield, went over a bridg as he went, but as he came 
back the bridg being gone, he attempted to ride through, fell 
off in the water, was carryed a quarter of a mile, a man seeing 
him took one of his horses, rid into the water got hold of him

14 Samuel Wadington had a son called Henry about 18 
yeares of age, who was not very witty and bee he could not doe 
his work so wel as the rest they dealt something sharply with 
him and struck him, upon thursday Jer : Brooksbank being in 
the house was discoursing of the great rain, and hurt done by 
waters, the yong man suddenly went out, they lookt not pre- 
sently after him, but wn children come from schoole they 
found him dead in a ditch — this was Sept 11 73— (next neigh-

Greetland, son to Mr Ramsden of Howarth at Halifax with his 
wife, his wife was coming doun town, and one Isaac Hopkin- 
sons son of Sowerby was riding up the street, his horse was 
frightened (some say by butchers, others say by a dog) but he 
pulled back, and could not hold him, cryed out to this woman 
to get out of the way, but she was heedles, looking at son.e 
things in her apron, bought at John Brearcliffs shop, but the 
horse came full but upon her, threw her doun, trod on her, she 
lay with her coats up very shamefully, the horses feet we: e 
fettered in her cloaths, the man leapt off, was the first that 
took her up, they carryed her into Mellons, she was not sensible 
there she lay in extremity of pain, from friday to Munday, on 
munday morning Sept 15 she dyed, I saw her husband this 
day, he wept, tlieres a jury to sit this afternoon, they bury her 
to morrow being thuesday at Ealand, because she was with child 
within 8 or 9 weeks of her time, and cannot be kept, its a most 
sad providence. Mr Ramsden doth violently prosecute this Isaac 
Hopkinson at the assizes to get him hanged, the reason he giues 
is this, otherwise sth he I cannot get another wife — sad reason —

Upon thursday Sept 8 1673 there came to my house a poor 
ragged man in black, tho he had a good stuffe coat over all, my 
wife called out of my study to speak to him, he told me he 
made bold to call of me I askt him what profession he was of, 
he told me that he was a preacher, that his name was Hulmes, 
that he came from beyond Ripley, had been upon the Walls 
beyond York.— I askt him if he understood greek, he answered, 
no, I askt him wt authours he read, he told me, authours enew, 
but he needed no papers, for he carryed his bible with him, I 
further discoursed with him, but found him a pittiful ignora- 
mus, understood no latine, talkt impertinently, would haue 
begged a pair of Stockings of me — I admonish t him for pre- 
tending to so high a profession without gifts or call, he sd he 
had sure gifts that had used it 16 yeares — I left him, Mr 
Furnace admitted this man to preach at Coley chappel Sept 21, 
wn he had done he desired church- wardens to collect something 
for him, but they not going, he went himself from seat to seat 
and gathered for himself some 7sh amongst people — 

17 Sept 12 73 in the great flood Mr Lee of Lime sent his 
man to Mtris Hide of Hide-mill with Venison, all was over- 
flowed about the bridg and water had worn a deep gulf, they 
bade him keep on the left hand, but he missing slipt in, and both 
man and horse went doun the water, so the man was drowned — 

18 that evening that the flood was 4 men stood by Stran- 
guidge, near Manchester, upon a tree and some upper ground 
about it stopping the corn that went doun, the water, but stayd 
so long that they could not get off, being compassed with 
water, and there were glad to stay till 11a clock at night, then 
were, fetcht off with horses, immediatly ' after they were gone, 
the tree and stack of corn and ground on wch they stood were 
all taken doun the water : 

19 Mr Mathew Hallows at Ratchdale (at whose house I lodged 
this week) having some land beyond the water, where his cloth 
is tentered, and the bridg being broken doun, useth a tub to 
swim over in, his men oft use it, I saw one goe over in it him-

Hulme now justice of peace) went to school at Manchester, 
tabled at my brother Hultons, had been squabling with a boy 
at schoole, came home complained of his head, vomited before 
he went to bed, grew worse, his parents sent for, Doctors came 
applyed many things to him, he grew frantick, sung much, 
could not be held in bed scarce by 4 lusty men, tho but a youth 
of about 17 yeares of age, Dr Anderton and Dr Chadwick 
almost martyred him with plaisters, leeches, shaving, clisters 
&amp;c yet confessed they understood not his disease, at last he 
dyed, was buryed at Manchester Sept 11 the day of that 
unparaleld flood, he was their only child, extraordinary dear, 
his mother is almost distracted with excessiue grief,— his father 
hath been something debauched, tho of late much reformed, 
yet exceeding devoted to conformity, the first work he did after 
he was justice of peace was sending good Mr. Wood to Lancaster 
jayl for preaching,— he hath said of my brother Hultons house, 
well is his, that he had rather see it afire then haue it hold a

seald away much, and had protested, sworn, and wished fearful 
imprecations agt her self if ever she sealed at the sale of any

note came, from Mr Bairstow to acquaint him he would cite 
him if he preacht, except he would giue him 5s — but he did 
preach, they brought the matter before Vicar Hook being then 
at Ewood (Mr Farrars house,) who sd he would not meddle 
betwixt them, withal] told them that what poure he had in 
pulpits in the viccaridge he had deputed to the curates, and he 
knew no reason but their oun minister should preach at the 
funerals of the rich, since he read the prayers at the burial of 
the poor— but still the contest continues : 

22 the last week being the first week in Nov (the day I am 
not ceartain) Henry Taylour, my neighbour Capt: Hodgsons 
man, coming out of Craven, with some cattel that had been 
summered there, as he came home, there overtook him a man 
on horseback, went by him, afterwards two men, wn they came 
upon a moor the two men fell a shouting and hollowing, Henry 
Taylour wondered what the matter was, they pointed and bade 
him look, and there he saw as well as they the man that rode 

first lying with , in the act of uncleannes, his horse 

standing by, just by the rode, they passed by and left them 

togather the woman he saw 

took her kit or pale and went towards a house and the man 
overtook him again, he then markt him well, the two men 
were Halifax men, but would not (or could not) tel who that 
abominable beast was, but the Saturday after, Henry saw the 
fellow in Halifax, and inquired who he was, he was told it was 
one James Murgatroyd, one that had sold wool in Halifax : 
Oh horrible wickednes ! oh prodigious impudence in sinning ! 
surely the Ephah is near full : 

23 M undav morning Nov 10 73 there came an apparitour 
from York and another from Halifax and apprehended James 
Brooksbank and Kobert Kamsden (two of our members) upon 
a writ de excommunicato capiendo, the occasion wherof was 
their refusing to take the church-wardens oath, though they 
faithfully served the office— when they were excommunicated 
(as they call it) they consulted with us what to doe, fearing 
the capias, we desired them to send to York, and get it off if a 
little inony would doe it, but Dr Hook (our goodly vicar) had 
put a bar in that so that it could not be done, so that its run 
up to this, and this day Nov 11 they are gone towards York

24 Abigail Hardger, living with Mr Horton at Sowerby, 
several yeares, would needs come away from them to her sister 
Hanna, tho her master and mistres were agt it, and her 
sister, and all her friends, but she did come, giving some poor 
frivolous reasons of her remoue, when she had been a while 
with her sister it was whispered among women that she was 
with child, she grew big discernably, her sisters told her of it, 
she was wonderful sturdy, and angry, could not abide their 
talk, went suddenly into service to Nathan Kershaws, there 
stayd a while, then went to Henry Bentleys in Sowerby, stil 
increasing in bulk, Mr Horton spoke to her, to know how 
matters were, she absolutely denyed, her brother Samuel laid it 
home to her, she denyed it with dreadfull imprecations, — at 
last women would search her brest, found milk, she then con- 
fessed, they got a license, were marryed at Halifax to that man 
viz one Thomas Wilkinson Mr Hortons man, she wanting but 
7 weekes of her time — Dec 24 73 shortly after their marriage 
we had a solemne day of fasting and prayer, at her sisters, she 
was there I talkt seriously to her, she wept bitterly, I askt her 
what most troubled her, poor creature she told me, that she 
had so sinned and shamed herself that she could not goe among 
any company : god helped me in discourse to beat upon her a 
weightier thing than that viz the offence agt god, and indeed 
all that were there were wonderfully affected with her case, she 
blubbered and wept much, but god only knows whether it was 
a kindly repentance, oh that god would now strike in, alas she 
hath been a wilfull wastful creature, was a great grief, to her 
mother, her father was a choyce Christian, my ancient intimate 
friend, oh that god would hear prayers for her, who knows but 
god may overshoot the devil m his oun bow, and take occasion 
from this fall to raise up her soul by grace —

was not so affected as sometimes, I was much straitened, — 
immediatly after prayer, she begun to draw away and presently 
expired, in lesse then half a quarter of an hour, tho ecchoing 
to every petition sensibly, I wondered, was much affected to 
see so sudden a change, from a ruddy, groaning and stirring 
body, to a white spiritles carcasse in an instant, I went from

went to the chamber-door wch was made fast, suspecting 
nothing, presently after they lookt in at the key-hole, saw her 
as they thought standing by a cupboard, they broke open the

curtains for window, she having her knees bended bee. too low : 
she was a widow, had been an anabaptist, now inclined to Quakers,

people that came to be confirmed by the Bps laying hands on

horsback, but Mr Rich being mounted on a good mare, outrid 
his company, and came down towards Wakefield bridge there 
was a great flood, waters were lying out so they ride deep 
before they came to the bridge, he being alone, his mare 
missed the bridge, and went below it into the main river, wch 
some imagine was 5 others 7 yards deep, his mare swam, he 
kept on, tho sometimes almost off, they were both taken doun 
a quarter of a mile doun the water, at last she came to the 
other side in the fields, where being to mount out of the water 
the mare could not, he got hold of a bough so parted from his 
beast, the bough failed him, he got hold of another, stuck there 
and at last got out, and at last he spyed his mare got into a 
field, he went to her, got on rode towards Ponfret forwards 
home, light of a house, went to bed got his cloaths dryed, so 
came home on Sabboth day — a miraculous providence, and fair 
warning ! I pray god it may awaken conscience, this man 
hath made a profession, entertained ministers and meetings at 
his house, but of late hath given over, often stays out late, 
comes home in the night, ventures through dangerous waters, 
Lord strike home by this providence, —

robbed them, so he is bond over to the Assizes, — that Mr Green 
of that town (an old adversary of mine) hath his servant- 
woman with child, and he mentioned 4 or 5 more in that town, 
guilty in the same kind, and one of Hunslet (lately admitted 
into the society at Miln-hil, but one partakt with them) now its 
broken out, that he hath his servant with child tho he hath a wife 
and 4 or 5 children : oh general and prodigious wickednes :

by Mr Cotes in Kildwick parish, and John Drake of Pikley —

a lusty black horse, hath a dog with him, pretends to be 
without mony hath eaten nothing but roots this 14 yeares, 
drinkes water, — boastes that he baffled Mr Either and several 
other ministers, he goeth to several 1 houses, they send for 
neighbours, he talks much to them, makes people admire him, 
— one man had crossed him in discourse, he took him by the 
hand, required him to kneel down with him, and let them pray 
that god would strike him that was in an errour, the man rusht 
from him and told him he thought he was a witch, wizzard or 
conjurer, would not meddle with him, — some doubt whether 
he may not be a jesuite — no body can tell me his name — oh 
the danger of ignorant soules from such forlorn wanderers ! —
