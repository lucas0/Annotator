<h1>McCain Charges Obama with Taking Advice from Raines</h1>
</div>

<p><object height="344" width="425"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/SYI0mHWQeD8&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1"/><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"/><embed allowfullscreen="true" height="344" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/SYI0mHWQeD8&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="425"/></object></p>
<p><em>By Howard Kurtz</em><br/>
<strong>The Ad:</strong> Obama has no background in economics. Who advises him? The Post says it's Franklin Raines, for "advice on mortgage and housing policy." Shocking. Under Raines, Fannie Mae committed "extensive financial fraud." Raines made millions. Fannie Mae collapsed. Taxpayers? Stuck with the bill. Barack Obama. Bad advice. Bad instincts. Not ready to lead.</p>
<p><strong>Analysis:</strong> This John McCain ad is based on a disputed premise.<br/>
<br/>
There's no dispute that Obama has no background in economics -- but then, neither does McCain, which makes this an odd charge for the Arizona senator to hurl.<br/>
<br/>
Fannie Mae did collapse, requiring a government takeover, and Raines, its former chairman, paid $25 million in April to settle a case brought by federal authorities investigating his role in the agency's accounting problems. But he has never been a close adviser to Obama.</p> <a id="more"></a> <p>The commercial's main charge is based on an April story in The Washington Post that said Raines has "taken calls from Barack Obama's presidential campaign seeking his advice on mortgage and housing policy matters." Reporter Anita Huslin says Raines told her that during an in-person interview.<br/>
<br/>
An Obama spokesman called the ad's contention "a flat-out lie," saying Raines has "never advised Senator Obama about anything, ever." But Raines did not claim to have advised the Illinois senator personally. In an accompanying statement, Raines said he never "provided his campaign with advice on housing or economic matters." That contradicts what he told Huslin five months ago.<br/>
<br/>
Whether viewers will somehow hold Obama responsible for the Fannie Mae collapse because of what is at best a slight association with its former head is open to question. The commercial seems intended as a response to an earlier Obama spot charging that McCain can't clean up Washington because seven of his top campaign officials are former lobbyists.</p>

<p>It's far too late for Barack Obama and Fannie Mae's disgraced former CEO, Franklin Raines, to deny that Obama's campaign sought Raines' "advice on mortgage and housing policy matters."  Raines himself made that boast when he was interviewed by the Washington Post's Anita Huslin last April, and it's beyond belief that neither Raines nor the Obama campaign noticed it when Huslin reported it shortly afterward.  If it wasn't true, they would have denied it then instead of waiting until it became an acute embarrassment over five months later.      </p>

<p>But Raines was CEO of the company when... up through 2004?  That is, four years ago, when the company was making a substantial profit?</p>
<p>And the statement that Raines "took calls" from Obama seeking advice doesn't say Raines actually gave him any advice.  In any case, Obama doesn't just take advice from one advisor.  He takes advice from many different points of view, synthesizes it all, and comes to a more balanced, objective policy...  unlike McCain, who indicated to Katie Couric that the flaw that would most hinder his ability to be President is that he lacks objectivity in his decisions.</p>

<p>Hemi ... please read my earlier note about Glass-Steagall. It's important. </p>
<p>On a relevant note, I can see that you are very afraid of the markets and our financial future overall. But to get at the solution, you can either chase down everything that's wrong, which would take a lifetime and more brainpower than possessed by the most brilliant economist (they often all disagree) or you can start from the perspective of what works and what can get us going again. </p>
<p>I used to study -- as a hobby -- education reform until I was exhausted from chasing down every hopeless alternative. For every "solution," there were drawbacks. Finally, it dawned on me that I needed to stop asking what doesn't work and ask myself what works best.</p>
<p>What do you feel works best for a healthy economy? Does it come from the government, that as Americans we don't instinctually trust, or do the solutions come from the individual?</p>
<p>I believe we need to put an emphasis on financial literacy in this country. Not just so consumers have the tools to protect themselves from a bad financial arrangement, but so they can understand how our markets work and not be so afraid to invest, which is the single-best way to provide for one's future. I cannot tell you the number of people I meet who have enough money to contribute to their 401(k)s, but they won't because they think it is all over their heads. What a grave loss. One of the big keys to investing is to start when you are young so you can drip money into those accounts, but I meet so many people who let 5, 10 years or more slip by before getting dipping a toe into the retirement subject. </p>
<p>People need to have a bigger stake in their financial futures -- and it starts with education. </p>
<p>If you have a heart for those hurt by this financial mess, then reach out to them -- not out of pity -- but to help them strengthen their financial positions. You can be a financial literacy educator. That's where change happens -- the you and me of this problem -- not the government. Because, let's be honest, you can have all the regulations you want, and a greedy mind can devise a workaround, a loophole to get their fists on money. It's up to the individual to stop the wolf at the door. </p>

<p>Hemi ... Clinton repealed the Glass-Steagall Act. That was a big mistake. It removed one of the most essential regulations that would have spared us this nightmare.</p>
<p>If you're a Democrat, you'll appreciate this balanced take -- no one escapes blame -- but Clinton does take a heaping portion:</p>

<p>From the Washington Post (via HotAir.com)... What say you about this, Kurtz?</p>
<p>    * 7/16/08: “In the four years since he stepped down as Fannie Mae’s chief executive under the shadow of a $6.3 billion accounting scandal, Franklin D. Raines has been quietly constructing a new life for himself. He has shaved eight points off his golf handicap, taken a corner office in Steve Case’s D.C. conglomeration of finance, entertainment and health-care companies and more recently, taken calls from Barack Obama’s presidential campaign seeking his advice on mortgage and housing policy matters.”<br/>
    * 8/28/08: “In the current crisis, their biggest backers have been Democrats such as Senate Banking Committee Chairman Christopher J. Dodd (Conn.) and House Financial Services Committee Chairman Barney Frank (Mass.). Two members of Mr. Obama’s political circle, James A. Johnson and Franklin D. Raines, are former chief executives of Fannie Mae.“<br/>

<p>Obama has James Johnson and Franklin Raines, while McCain has Ken Duberstein.  Kenneth sat on the Fannie Mae board from 1998-2007.</p>
<p>He helped McCain with his 2000 Presidential run and then headed George W.'s transition team to the White House.</p>
<p>While on the Fannie Board, Ken's firm got over $1.8 million for keeping the regulatory wolves away from the door. </p>
<p>Be careful what you cite, Mr. McCain.  The stench in Washington is in John's closet. </p>

<p>Hi, Hemi,</p>
<p>Not everyone is losing their homes. I know a lot of smart young folks who have waited until housing prices have come down and are reasonable -- like a 1:3 income to house ratio, instead of the old 1:9 ratio -- to buy. </p>
<p>So some of us have tried to be smart with the little money we have. The others in this mess are, sadly, financially illiterate or they are speculators (late to the game, I might add). </p>
<p>Always be a contrarian investor -- tighten your belt when things are overpriced, save your pennies, and when someone else's rainy day comes, then buy that reasonably priced home. It's a challenge at a time of inflation, but it's the only way to make the best of what you have to spend. That's the only way to make a meager income stretch. Americans are starting to figure this out and adjust -- when there's a crisis, people wise up. And what's so very encouraging is to see the renewed interest in teaching kids financial literacy in the classroom. It's vital. Hopefully, it creates a generation of financial independence, so when campaigns run ads about growing government, voters can respond, "Why? I'm already doing for myself!" That's freedom -- instead of waiting for someone to liberate you from poor decisions. </p>

<p>A lot of people weren't paying attention to buying at the top. They were offered a chance to buy a home with little or no credit and jumped on the opportunity to do it.  What ticks me off is the lies that were told to people to make them think they could afford it. You can't expect people to know all the little details about buying a home. Their supposed to tell ya what's going on. These crooks were more concerned about making the deal to fill their pockets than they were about somebody that's going to lose everything. I've seen the shows on TV of people that lost their whole life savings because they weren't told about what happens when the interest rates go up. And I've also heard the stories about people living in their cars in parking lots because they have no place to go.. There used to be laws to protect people against stuff like this. The Republicans play this game every time. All their growth comes from borrowing and back-room deals that go bust in the end leaving us holding the bag. And the one thing that burns me up the most is the Naked Short Selling on Wall Street.. Their making millions on something that's 100% illegal and no one seems to have anything to say about it. It's the same thing as robbing a bank. They've gone to far. Bush got elected and he gave all his cronies a license to steal. It doesn't matter how smart you are if there's no rules to go by.</p>

<p>Oh, Hemi ... important question ... because this has to do with perceptions and Obama's tax plan (the recent iteration):</p>
<p>What income do you consider "to be wealthy"?</p>
<p>I say it depends. If you're in a city, two income with two kids, you're going to need in excess of $110k. That is to afford a home in a reasonably nice neighborhood. I don't have kids, but I've lived in 3 cities (NY, SF and DC), so I know the costs. </p>
<p>Your thoughts?</p>

<p>As a Republican, I would have preferred Romney, but we got Palin. It's made me nervous, but the national dialogue has changed in the last 4 years and has indirectly forced both parties to choose unknown quantities for both tickets. </p>
<p>As far as McCain being old, I don't blink at those things. I've learned from my own life experience to value the wisdom of those older than me. Sadly, our culture worships youth. The other "ism" in this campaign is age-ism. And the hostile attitudes I've seen displayed on the Web gives me the impression that those 40 and under (of which I'm one of) would just dismiss all of their elders' experience for a chance at the driver's wheel. You gotta earn it, you gotta prove it with a record, you gotta have more than words.<br/>

<p>Have you watched "Hype"? It's a real eye-opener. Dick Morris has a beautiful segment on Obama and taxes. All I can say is that if Obama wins, you better figure out a way to save money after taxes. You and all of us will be hurting. Watch it. You owe it to yourself to challenge your ideas. I grew up in a rabid liberal environment and I work around liberals, so I'm constantly tested. </p>

And our world is not ready for someone who is  incapable of grasping the reality that most grounded Americans can already see:  a tragic charade colored with moxy who attempts to accompany a candidate for president who is old, weak and should be enjoying his final years without the added stress of these next 5 weeks.</p>

<p>In response to the turmoil that has roiled the domestic and worldwide financial markets, Mr. Obama delivered a 40-minute speech in this city west of Denver. He called for more aggressive regulation of Wall Street and a renewed emphasis on innovation. </p>
<p>“What we’ve seen the last few days ,” Mr. Obama said, “is nothing less than the final verdict on an economic philosophy that has completely failed.”</p>
<p>Mr. Obama essentially hit the rewind button on Tuesday, stepping back to remind voters of a series of economic proposals that he has offered over the last 19 months. His campaign’s movement was built on an opposition to the Iraq war, not a message of economic populism, so many of his proposals have received only moderate attention.</p>
<p>He called on increasing government oversight and supervision on all regulated financial institutions and strengthening capital requirements –- particularly for mortgage securities and other derivatives -– at the center of the financial crisis. He also proposed streamlining regulatory agencies as well as cracking down on trading activity that manipulates markets.</p>
<p>“We need to regulate institutions for what they do, not what they are,” Mr. Obama said. “Over the last few years, commercial banks and thrift institutions were subject to guidelines on subprime mortgages that did not apply to mortgage brokers and companies.<br/>

<p>Ya know what, this election is rigged to the max. I looked up the articles months ago about voter registration, and Democrats were wiping the floor with Republicans. Now all of a sudden you have all (new articles) out that say the Republicans have some new high tech get out the vote operation going on . Obama was registering voters since the primary with Clinton when the Republicans weren't even talking about voter registration. And like I said before, Gore won the popular vote in 2000, and Kerry only lost it by 3% in 04. As mad as people are now about the mess we're in, your going to tell me that more people are going to vote Republican for another 4 years of George Bush. I don't think so. There is no way on earth that people are enjoying losing their jobs, homes, and 4 dollar a gallon gas. And I won't even get in to the Iraq war that produced no WMD's and took 5000 American lives. You people are living in La La land.<br/>

<p>Anything the Washington Post or Howard Kurtz prints, particular concerning politics, needs to be checked independently for veracity.  Their track record is dubious and highly partisan.  My instinct is to assume they are lying until proven otherwise.</p>

<p>FEDERAL HOUSING ENTERPRISE REGULATORY REFORM ACT OF 2005</p>
<p>GovTrak- Senate Record</p>
<p>Sen. John McCain [R-AZ]: Mr. President, this week Fannie Mae's regulator reported that the company's quarterly reports of profit growth over the past few years were "illusions deliberately and systematically created" by the company's senior management, which resulted in a $10.6 billion accounting scandal.</p>
<p>The Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight's report goes on to say that Fannie Mae employees deliberately and intentionally manipulated financial reports to hit earnings targets in order to trigger bonuses for senior executives. In the case of Franklin Raines, Fannie Mae's former chief executive officer, OFHEO's report shows that over half of Mr. Raines' compensation for the 6 years through 2003 was directly tied to meeting earnings targets. The report of financial misconduct at Fannie Mae echoes the deeply troubling $5 billion profit restatement at Freddie Mac.</p>
<p>The OFHEO report also states that Fannie Mae used its political power to lobby Congress in an effort to interfere with the regulator's examination of the company's accounting problems. This report comes some weeks after Freddie Mac paid a record $3.8 million fine in a settlement with the Federal Election Commission and restated lobbying disclosure reports from 2004 to 2005. These are entities that have demonstrated over and over again that they are deeply in need of reform.</p>
<p>For years I have been concerned about the regulatory structure that governs Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac--known as Government-sponsored entities or GSEs--and the sheer magnitude of these companies and the role they play in the housing market. OFHEO's report this week does nothing to ease these concerns. In fact, the report does quite the contrary. OFHEO's report solidifies my view that the GSEs need to be reformed without delay.</p>
<p>Quick Info<br/>
S. 190 [109th]: Federal Housing Enterprise Regulatory Reform Act of 2005<br/>
Last Action: Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs. Ordered to be reported with an amendment in the nature of a substitute favorably.<br/>
Status: DeadI join as a cosponsor of the Federal Housing Enterprise Regulatory Reform Act of 2005, S. 190, to underscore my support for quick passage of GSE regulatory reform legislation. If Congress does not act, American taxpayers will continue to be exposed to the enormous risk that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac pose to the housing market, the overall financial system, and the economy as a whole.</p>
<p>I urge my colleagues to support swift action on this GSE reform legislation.</p>

<p>Hello Mr. Kurtz,</p>
<p>You will fail in your attempt to mischaracterize this issue, with your defensive article trying to protect Obama.  As others have previously mentioned, this article of yours is at odds with others published in your own newspaper.  Allow me to clarify the issue you're trying to obscure.</p>
<p>When John McCain said:</p>
<p>"Two years ago, I called for reform of this corruption at Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Congress did nothing. The Administration did nothing. Senator Obama did nothing, and actually profited from this system of abuse and scandal. While Fannie and Freddie were working to keep Congress away from their house of cards, Senator Obama was taking their money. He got more, in fact, than any other member of Congress, except for the Democratic chairmen of the committee that oversees them. And while Fannie Mae was betraying the public trust, somehow its former CEO had managed to gain my opponent's trust to the point that Senator Obama actually put him in charge of his vice presidential search."</p>
<p>This is what he was referring to:</p>
<p>"Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have also strategically given more contributions to lawmakers currently sitting on committees that primarily regulate their industry. Fifteen of the 25 lawmakers who have received the most from the two companies combined since the 1990 election sit on either the House Financial Services Committee; the Senate Banking, Housing &amp; Urban Affairs Committee; or the Senate Finance Committee. The others have seats on the powerful Appropriations or Ways &amp; Means committees, are members of the congressional leadership or have run for president. Sen. Chris Dodd (D-Conn.), chairman of the Senate banking committee, has received the most from Fannie and Freddie's PACs and employees ($133,900 since 1989). Rep. Paul Kanjorski (D-Pa.) has received $65,500. Kanjorski chairs the House Financial Services Subcommittee on Capital Markets, Insurance and Government-Sponsored Enterprises, and Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae are government-sponsored enterprises, or GSEs.</p>
<p>Top Recipients of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac<br/>
Campaign Contributions, 1989-2008</p>
<p>Dodd, Christopher J [ S D-CT ]  $133,900<br/>
Kerry, John         [ S D-MA ]  $111,000<br/>
Obama, Barack       [ S D-IL ]  $105,849<br/>
Clinton, Hillary    [ S D-NY ]   $75,550<br/>
Kanjorski, Paul E   [ H D-PA ]   $65,500"</p>
<p>Given his recent arrival on the scene, Obama seems to be catching up very quickly.  This is available at:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.opensecrets.org/news/2008/07/top-senate-recipients-of-fanni.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.opensecrets.org/news/2008/07/top-senate-recipients-of-fanni.html</a></p>
<p>Here's what Wikipedia had on Raines before Obama's people deleted it:<br/>
<br/>
"Franklin Delano Raines (born January 14, 1949 in Seattle, Washington) is the former chairman and chief executive officer of Fannie Mae who served as White House budget director under President Bill Clinton. He is currently employed by Barack Obama's Presidential Campaign as an economic adviser.</p>
<p>The son of a Seattle janitor [1], Raines graduated from Harvard University, Harvard Law School; and Magdalen College, Oxford University as a Rhodes Scholar. Raines was of age during the Vietnam War, but performed no military service. He served in the Carter Administration as associate director for economics and government in the Office of Management and Budget and assistant director of the White House Domestic Policy Staff from 1977 to 1979. Then he joined Lazard Freres and Co., where he worked for 11 years and became a general partner. In 1991 he became Fannie's Mae's Vice Chairman, a post he left in 1996 in order to join the Clinton Administration as the Director of the U.S. Office of Management and Budget, where he served until 1998. In 1999, he returned to Fannie Mae as CEO, "the first black man to head a Fortune 500 company."[1]</p>
<p>On December 21, 2004 Raines accepted what he called "early retirement" [2] from his position as CEO while U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission investigators continued to investigate alleged accounting irregularities. He is accused by The Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight (OFHEO), the regulating body of Fannie Mae, of abetting widespread accounting errors, which included the shifting of losses so senior executives, such as himself, could earn large bonuses [3]."</p>
<p>. . .</p>
<p>"In June 2008 Wall Street Journal reported that Franklin Raines was one of several politicians who received below market rate loans at Countrywide Financial because the corporation considered the officeholders "FOA's"--"Friends of Angelo" (Countrywide Chief Executive Angelo Mozilo). He received loans for over $3 million while CEO of Fannie Mae. [5] Franklin Raines is currently one of Barack Obama's chief economic advisers."</p>

<p>Mr. Kurtz, you won't be able to obscure the truth of this for 45 days.  This is not your father's newsmedia.  McCain looks more precient than ever in his calls for campaign finance reform, as this illustrates the need for it.  This issue is taylor made for him.  He can even claim ownership of the issue as he lead the movement and co-sponsored the reform legistation.  Now he can say, "This is what I was talking about."  Many people will see an enormous conflict of interest when congressmen and presidential candidates are accepting contributions from what has become essentially a bankrupt corrupt government agency, which they had oversight responsibility for this whole time.  Now the taxpayers have been force to pay for this mess.  With the war nearly over, this will take center stage, as it should.  The economy is the number one issue, and this scandal caused all the damage to the economy.  Get ready for President McCain, and get ready for the next 'Watergate' trials.  This scandal is bigger than this year's presidential campaign, which it will decide.</p>

<p>What makes you think Obama is not ready to be President. He' a lot smarter than McCain, and knows how Washington works just as much as anyone else. He's got 8 years in the Ill. Senate, and almost 4 in the U.S. Senate.. There comes a point in time when the amount of years you have in just don't matter anymore. Then it's all about the decisions you make. And everyone knows that McCain has a real bad temper. A person like that don't think with their head. You throw a Dick Cheney in to the mix, and you get another unnecessary Iraq war.  <br/>

Wow, Bush's pals just ripped off people for billions by naked shorting the market (which is illegal ) but you wouldn't know it by the way Cox is calling for a temporary ban on an illegal act. And you got some nerve talking about wasteful spending when the republican moron in the White House already burnt 3 trillion dollars on another illegal act, the Iraq war. Then that lo-life moron sends his whole family over to Iraq to set up his dummy companies and make millions off the lives of our soldiers blood. And another thing, I didn't fail at math, but you sure as hell failed at spelling. You can't even spell Democrats right. And wasteful is spelled with an E and one L. And what the hell is a TROFF.

<p>I don't think so.  McCain's add is tying the housing crises to Obama for possibly seeking advice. And to top it all off, this story is about accounting matters that have nothing to do with the current problems we're facing now. This crises is about regulation. Or should I say, deregulation. And we all know who that republican was that's responsible for slipping in that bundle of disaster that got passed..</p>

<p>The only thing that's sad is Pappy McCain and his deteriorating brain. Everyone knows that the media is corrupt as hell, and nobody pays any attention to what they say. Their corrupt polls that don't consider people with cell phones as part of the election because that's where Obama's largest base is. Their all a joke. McCain's lies has people jumping the republican sinking ship big time. Democrats are registering by the millions while the Repubes are becoming a dying breed.. The only way you'll win this election is by stealing it with your rigged voting machines. Everything you repubs touch turns corrupt, and I wouldn't expect this election to be any different.<br/>

<p>McCain - Federal Housing Enterprise Regulatory Reform Act of 2005 (Democrats blocked reform)</p>
<p>Senator McCain warned in 2005, “This week Fannie Maes regulator reported that the companys quarterly reports of profit growth over the past few years were illusions deliberately and systematically created by the companys senior management, which resulted in a $10.6 billion accounting scandal.</p>
<p>The Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversights report goes on to say that Fannie Mae employees deliberately and intentionally manipulated financial reports to hit earnings targets in order to trigger bonuses for senior executives. In the case of Franklin Raines, Fannie Maes former chief executive officer, OFHEOs report shows that over half of Mr. Raines compensation for the 6 years through 2003 was directly tied to meeting earnings targets. The report of financial misconduct at Fannie Mae echoes the deeply troubling $5 billion profit restatement at Freddie Mac.</p>
<p>The OFHEO report also states that Fannie Mae used its political power to lobby Congress in an effort to interfere with the regulators examination of the companys accounting problems. This report comes some weeks after Freddie Mac paid a record $3.8 million fine in a settlement with the Federal Election Commission and restated lobbying disclosure reports from 2004 to 2005. These are entities that have demonstrated over and over again that they are deeply in need of reform.</p>
<p>For years I have been concerned about the regulatory structure that governs Fannie Mae and Freddie Macknown as Government-sponsored entities or GSEsand the sheer magnitude of these companies and the role they play in the housing market. OFHEOs report this week does nothing to ease these concerns. In fact, the report does quite the contrary. OFHEOs report solidifies my view that the GSEs need to be reformed without delay.</p>
<p>I join as a cosponsor of the Federal Housing Enterprise Regulatory Reform Act of 2005, S. 190, to underscore my support for quick passage of GSE regulatory reform legislation. If Congress does not act, American taxpayers will continue to be exposed to the enormous risk that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac pose to the housing market, the overall financial system, and the economy as a whole.</p>
<p>I urge my colleagues to support swift action on this GSE reform legislation."</p>

<p>Part of McCain's Economic Speech in Green Bay, Wisconsin<br/>
John McCain</p>
<p>If Governor Palin and I are elected in 46 days, we are not going to waste a moment in changing the way Washington does business. And we're going to start where the need for reform is greatest. In short order, we are going to put an end to the reckless conduct, corruption, and unbridled greed that have caused a crisis on Wall Street.</p>
<p>Here and all across our country, people are wondering what exactly is happening on Wall Street. And with good reason, they want to know how their government will meet the crisis. Clear answers are hard to come by in Washington.</p>
<p>As Senator Obama's leader in Congress memorably put it the other day -- and I quote -- "no one knows what to do." Perhaps given that reaction, it shouldn't surprise us that the Congressional leaders of this do-nothing Congress also said that they weren't going to take action until after the election, claiming that it wasn't their fault. I am hopeful that last night's discussions are a sign they have changed their mind and will take action soon. But any action should be designed to keep people in their homes and safe guard the life savings of all Americans by protecting our financial system.</p>
<p>There are certainly plenty of places to point fingers, and it may be hard to pinpoint the original event that set it all in motion. But let me give you an educated guess. The financial crisis we're living through today started with the corruption and manipulation of our home mortgage system. At the center of the problem were the lobbyists, politicians, and bureaucrats who succeeded in persuading Congress and the administration to ignore the festering problems at Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.</p>
<p>These quasi-public corporations lead our housing system down a path where quick profit was placed before sound finance. They institutionalized a system that rewarded forcing mortgages on people who couldn't afford them, while turning around and selling those bad mortgages to the banks that are now going bankrupt. Using money and influence, they prevented reforms that would have curbed their power and limited their ability to damage our economy. And now, as ever, the American taxpayers are left to pay the price for Washington's failure.</p>
<p>Two years ago, I called for reform of this corruption at Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Congress did nothing. The Administration did nothing. Senator Obama did nothing, and actually profited from this system of abuse and scandal. While Fannie and Freddie were working to keep Congress away from their house of cards, Senator Obama was taking their money. He got more, in fact, than any other member of Congress, except for the Democratic chairmen of the committee that oversees them. And while Fannie Mae was betraying the public trust, somehow its former CEO had managed to gain my opponent's trust to the point that Senator Obama actually put him in charge of his vice presidential search.</p>
<p>This CEO, Mr. Johnson, walked off with tens of millions of dollars in salary and bonuses for services rendered to Fannie Mae, even after authorities discovered accounting improprieties that padded his compensation. Another CEO for Fannie Mae, Mr. Raines, has been advising Senator Obama on housing policy. This even after Fannie Mae was found to have committed quote "extensive financial fraud" under his leadership. Like Mr. Johnson, Mr. Raines walked away with tens of millions of dollars.</p>
<p>Senator Obama may be taking their advice and he may be taking their money, but in a McCain-Palin administration, there will be no seat for these people at the policy-making table. They won't even get past the front gate at the White House.</p>
<p>My friends, this is the problem with Washington. People like Senator Obama have been too busy gaming the system and haven't ever done a thing to actually challenge the system.</p>
<p>We've heard a lot of words from Senator Obama over the course of this campaign. But maybe just this once he could spare us the lectures, and admit to his own poor judgment in contributing to these problems. The crisis on Wall Street started in the Washington culture of lobbying and influence peddling, and he was square in the middle of it.</p>
<p>Read the entire speech. It was excellent and gives solutions to keep this corruption from happening again...</p>

<p>____________________________________</p>
<p>Not only is McCain lying, he's using Obama's words from a speech given the other day. John McCain has some nerve saying Obama is taking money. McCain has decided he's going to say anything he wants to get elected. We should just start spreading roomers that he's a child molester and say we got pictures to back it up. This isn't an election it's a McCain freak show.<br/>

<p>The Washington Post disputes your conclusion about the premise, Howie:</p>
<p>"In the four years since he stepped down as Fannie Mae’s chief executive under the shadow of a $6.3 billion accounting scandal, Franklin D. Raines has been quietly constructing a new life for himself. He has shaved eight points off his golf handicap, taken a corner office in Steve Case’s D.C. conglomeration of finance, entertainment and health-care companies and more recently, taken calls from Barack Obama’s presidential campaign seeking his advice on mortgage and housing policy matters.” 8/28/08</p>
<p>“In the current crisis, their biggest backers have been Democrats such as Senate Banking Committee Chairman Christopher J. Dodd (Conn.) and House Financial Services Committee Chairman Barney Frank (Mass.). Two members of Mr. Obama’s political circle, James A. Johnson and Franklin D. Raines, are former chief executives of Fannie Mae.“</p>
<p>Of course, maybe you just don't trust the WaPo...</p>

<p>So, when the Washington Post twice states that Raines is an advisor of Obama that is a disputed fact?</p>
<p>Fair enough.  Good to know.  All the facts in the Washington Post, even repeated ones, are disputed and not to be trusted.</p>
<p>Let me guess, the opinion articles are to be trusted?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/07/15/AR2008071502827.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/07/15/AR2008071502827.html</a><br/>

<p>I guess both of these articles are false/disputed and not to be trusted.</p>
<p>Kurtz, why do you work for an organization when you believe they can't get simple facts correct for a News Story?  Do you believe working for incompetents and idiots will enhance your credibility?  </p>
<p>Or do you believe that calling your own organization incompetent and incorrect will enhance your job status?</p>

<p>I doubt many of the readers recall this article from the New York Times five years ago...</p>
<p>"The Bush administration today recommended the most significant regulatory overhaul in the housing finance industry since the savings and loan crisis a decade ago.</p>
<p>Under the plan, disclosed at a Congressional hearing today, a new agency would be created within the Treasury Department to assume supervision of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-sponsored companies that are the two largest players in the mortgage lending industry.</p>
<p>The new agency would have the authority, which now rests with Congress, to set one of the two capital-reserve requirements for the companies. It would exercise authority over any new lines of business. And it would determine whether the two are adequately managing the risks of their ballooning portfolios.</p>
<p>The plan is an acknowledgment by the administration that oversight of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac which together have issued more than $1.5 trillion in outstanding debt is broken. A report by outside investigators in July concluded that Freddie Mac manipulated its accounting to mislead investors, and critics have said Fannie Mae does not adequately hedge against rising interest rates.</p>
<p>We can see now that the Bush administration had accurately diagnosed the problem in the lending market and had a plan to address it. Reluctanly Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac supported the plan. However, Democrats objected.</p>
<p>Among the groups denouncing the proposal today were the National Association of Home Builders and Congressional Democrats who fear that tighter regulation of the companies could sharply reduce their commitment to financing low-income and affordable housing.</p>
<p>These two entities Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are not facing any kind of financial crisis, said Representative Barney Frank of Massachusetts, the ranking Democrat on the Financial Services Committee. The more people exaggerate these problems, the more pressure there is on these companies, the less we will see in terms of affordable housing. </p>
<p>Representative Melvin L. Watt, Democrat of North Carolina, agreed.</p>
<p>I dont see much other than a shell game going on here, moving something from one agency to another and in the process weakening the bargaining power of poorer families and their ability to get affordable housing, Mr. Watt said. "</p>

<p>McCain - Federal Housing Enterprise Regulatory Reform Act of 2005 (Democrats blocked reform)</p>
<p>Senator McCain warned in 2005, “This week Fannie Maes regulator reported that the companys quarterly reports of profit growth over the past few years were illusions deliberately and systematically created by the companys senior management, which resulted in a $10.6 billion accounting scandal.</p>
<p>The Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversights report goes on to say that Fannie Mae employees deliberately and intentionally manipulated financial reports to hit earnings targets in order to trigger bonuses for senior executives. In the case of Franklin Raines, Fannie Maes former chief executive officer, OFHEOs report shows that over half of Mr. Raines compensation for the 6 years through 2003 was directly tied to meeting earnings targets. The report of financial misconduct at Fannie Mae echoes the deeply troubling $5 billion profit restatement at Freddie Mac.</p>
<p>The OFHEO report also states that Fannie Mae used its political power to lobby Congress in an effort to interfere with the regulators examination of the companys accounting problems. This report comes some weeks after Freddie Mac paid a record $3.8 million fine in a settlement with the Federal Election Commission and restated lobbying disclosure reports from 2004 to 2005. These are entities that have demonstrated over and over again that they are deeply in need of reform.</p>
<p>For years I have been concerned about the regulatory structure that governs Fannie Mae and Freddie Macknown as Government-sponsored entities or GSEsand the sheer magnitude of these companies and the role they play in the housing market. OFHEOs report this week does nothing to ease these concerns. In fact, the report does quite the contrary. OFHEOs report solidifies my view that the GSEs need to be reformed without delay.</p>
<p>I join as a cosponsor of the Federal Housing Enterprise Regulatory Reform Act of 2005, S. 190, to underscore my support for quick passage of GSE regulatory reform legislation. If Congress does not act, American taxpayers will continue to be exposed to the enormous risk that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac pose to the housing market, the overall financial system, and the economy as a whole.</p>
<p>I urge my colleagues to support swift action on this GSE reform legislation."<br/>

<p>Have we all lost our minds? We are sooo divided right now; what are you Left or Right? I’m Neither. Is that what really defines you. Take a look inward; we all need some improvement and we all need to take responsibility for our actions. I would expect the government to do the same. We need to unite...WE WILL NEVER WIN AS A DIVIDED COUNTRY...we are literally fighting amongst ourselves. Why not vote strictly on facts on the person not the party. The past is the past we can’t change it. We need to move forward. I am tired of being "treated" by the media and politicians like I am unintelligent and that because of a fancy campaign ad or a good one-liner I am going to give you my vote. No it doesn't work that way for me and it shouldn't work that way for you. This is serious business we are not voting for the captain of a football team, we are voting for the top position of our country...yes OUR country...YOU and ME and everyone else that lives on this blessed land. It’s not a Republican country or a Demographic country and I refused to be pigeon-holed into one position or another. It’s the UNITED States…an American country. We need some honest change. Most of us are really suffering here and we need to all come together and but aside our differences and do what’s best for the whole and not just a select few.</p>

<p>The reason we're divided is because people get nothing but lies from our leaders. Some people take the time to look and see what's going on, and the others listen to the propaganda. I've spent hours talking with people on You Tube, laying out the situation on everything from Bush's family of war profiteers to the stock market, and in the end all they want to do is stay loyal to their government. That Patriotism line gets them every time. Doesn't it say in the constitution that if our leaders are corrupt we have the right to take control by force if necessary. Or something like that. All of them need to be replaced. They've turned a government for the people into a business. And that business serves them and leaves us high and dry. Just like Obama said, lose everything, your on your own.<br/>

<p>If Governor Palin and I are elected in 46 days, we are not going to waste a moment in changing the way Washington does business. And we're going to start where the need for reform is greatest. In short order, we are going to put an end to the reckless conduct, corruption, and unbridled greed that have caused a crisis on Wall Street.</p>
<p>Here and all across our country, people are wondering what exactly is happening on Wall Street. And with good reason, they want to know how their government will meet the crisis. Clear answers are hard to come by in Washington.</p>
<p>As Senator Obama's leader in Congress memorably put it the other day -- and I quote -- "no one knows what to do." Perhaps given that reaction, it shouldn't surprise us that the Congressional leaders of this do-nothing Congress also said that they weren't going to take action until after the election, claiming that it wasn't their fault. I am hopeful that last night's discussions are a sign they have changed their mind and will take action soon. But any action should be designed to keep people in their homes and safe guard the life savings of all Americans by protecting our financial system.</p>
<p>There are certainly plenty of places to point fingers, and it may be hard to pinpoint the original event that set it all in motion. But let me give you an educated guess. The financial crisis we're living through today started with the corruption and manipulation of our home mortgage system. At the center of the problem were the lobbyists, politicians, and bureaucrats who succeeded in persuading Congress and the administration to ignore the festering problems at Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.</p>
<p>These quasi-public corporations lead our housing system down a path where quick profit was placed before sound finance. They institutionalized a system that rewarded forcing mortgages on people who couldn't afford them, while turning around and selling those bad mortgages to the banks that are now going bankrupt. Using money and influence, they prevented reforms that would have curbed their power and limited their ability to damage our economy. And now, as ever, the American taxpayers are left to pay the price for Washington's failure.</p>
<p>Two years ago, I called for reform of this corruption at Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Congress did nothing. The Administration did nothing. Senator Obama did nothing, and actually profited from this system of abuse and scandal. While Fannie and Freddie were working to keep Congress away from their house of cards, Senator Obama was taking their money. He got more, in fact, than any other member of Congress, except for the Democratic chairmen of the committee that oversees them. And while Fannie Mae was betraying the public trust, somehow its former CEO had managed to gain my opponent's trust to the point that Senator Obama actually put him in charge of his vice presidential search.</p>
<p>This CEO, Mr. Johnson, walked off with tens of millions of dollars in salary and bonuses for services rendered to Fannie Mae, even after authorities discovered accounting improprieties that padded his compensation. Another CEO for Fannie Mae, Mr. Raines, has been advising Senator Obama on housing policy. This even after Fannie Mae was found to have committed quote "extensive financial fraud" under his leadership. Like Mr. Johnson, Mr. Raines walked away with tens of millions of dollars.</p>
<p>Senator Obama may be taking their advice and he may be taking their money, but in a McCain-Palin administration, there will be no seat for these people at the policy-making table. They won't even get past the front gate at the White House.</p>
<p>My friends, this is the problem with Washington. People like Senator Obama have been too busy gaming the system and haven't ever done a thing to actually challenge the system.</p>
<p>We've heard a lot of words from Senator Obama over the course of this campaign. But maybe just this once he could spare us the lectures, and admit to his own poor judgment in contributing to these problems. The crisis on Wall Street started in the Washington culture of lobbying and influence peddling, and he was square in the middle of it.</p>
<p>Read the entire speech.  It was excellent and gives solutions to keep this corruption from happening again...</p>

<p>Lehman Brothers collapse is traced back to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the two big mortgage banks that got a federal bailout a few weeks ago.</p>
<p>Freddie and Fannie used huge lobbying budgets and political contributions to keep regulators off their backs.</p>
<p>A group called the Center for Responsive Politics keeps track of which politicians get Fannie and Freddie political contributions. The top three U.S. senators getting big Fannie and Freddie political bucks were Democrats and No. 2 is Sen. Barack Obama.</p>
<p>Now remember, he's only been in the Senate four years, but he still managed to grab the No. 2 spot ahead of John Kerry — decades in the Senate — and Chris Dodd, who is chairman of the Senate Banking Committee.</p>
<p>Fannie and Freddie have been creations of the congressional Democrats and the Clinton White House, designed to make mortgages available to more people and, as it turns out, some people who couldn't afford them.</p>
<p>Fannie and Freddie have also been places for big Washington Democrats to go to work in the semi-private sector and pocket millions. The Clinton administration's White House Budget Director Franklin Raines ran Fannie and collected $50 million. Jamie Gorelick — Clinton Justice Department official — worked for Fannie and took home $26 million. Big Democrat Jim Johnson, recently on Obama's VP search committee, has hauled in millions from his Fannie Mae CEO job.</p>
<p>Now remember: Obama's ads and stump speeches attack McCain and Republican policies for the current financial turmoil. It is demonstrably not Republican policy and worse, it appears the man attacking McCain — Sen. Obama — was at the head of the line when the piggies lined up at the Fannie and Freddie trough for campaign bucks.</p>
<p>Sen. Barack Obama: No. 2 on the Fannie/Freddie list of favored politicians after just four short years in the Senate.</p>
<p>Next time you see that ad, you might notice he fails to mention that part of the Fannie and Freddie problem.<br/>

<p>The argument that you can tell who a person is by who they associate with is disputable in itself, and the extent, circumstances, and nature of the relationship are among the countless variables which we would have to consider before taking the argument seriously.<br/>

<p>Of course you can.  Would you associate with a=0 if you weren't one?  Would you listen to racists rants - repeatedly and freely if you found that repulsive?<br/>
Would you deal with a crook to buy property if it benefited you ... maybe .... see, that goes to character.</p>

<p>Any candidate who has had former Sen. Phil Gramm on his campaign team has no business criticizing his opponent on anything related to the economy.  If John McCain didn't know Phil Gramm's (the recession is just a mental one)deregulation legislation would help get us into this mess in the first place, then he has no business criticizing Barack Obama. If John McCain didn't know that the failed Bush economic policies, most of which he's supported (until this week) would end the way they have, then we can't afford to have him as President, because it would merely be another 4 years of economic disasters.  </p>
<p>The truth is that, as he said himself back in the Spring, John McCain knows nothing about economics and finance.  Afterall, he has a military pension, will get a government pension for his 26 years up on Capitol Hill, and for now, his wife's money and their 7 (or is it 9) homes can help him wether any economic storm.  So, what's he got to worry about?</p>
<p>John McCain does not have the solution to our nation's economic problems, John McCain and his cronies are part of the problem!</p>

<p>clinton may have had a balanced budget on paper. It came about because of something called Reagonomics. A long range plan to show up in the future. The only bad thing is it came into effect because of a republican congress and Reagonomics while clinton was president. Clinton only claimed responsibility for it.</p>

<p>If your ideal is a guy who was a community organizer getting voters to register using “Rules for Radicals” by Saul Alinksy, who had his first political fundraiser at the home of self-acknowledged bomber Bill Ayers; who bought his home at a discount from a convict named Rezko and then lied about their relationship; who dedicates his book to his father who deserted him then disses his mother and grandmother as typical prejudiced white people after they stayed and raised him; who sat in church for 20 years listening to his mentor and spiritual guide Wright preach hate of America, hate of white people, promulgate black power and racism then claim he never heard the sermons and never protests the church giving a lifetime achievement award to anti-Semite Louis Farrakhan; who chose as his wife a woman who dislikes her country which is mean and nasty and was never proud of it until now; who belittles small town residents, for clinging to guns and religion, when he thinks they're out of earshot; who believes the morality of abortion is “above my pay grade”; who has been in the State and US senate but can't seem to make decisions on whether to vote yes or no; who has never in his life run anything; who says one thing then does another - campaign financing, NAFTA, voting for the troops, voting for the Bridge to Nowhere; who criticizes America while he is roaming the globe as the Citizen of the World; who advocates big government, big spending and expanded entitlement programs all paid for by huge tax increases. If that's your ideal, then you certainly should vote for Barack Obama.</p>

<p>It is a historical fact that republicans accept financial cotributions from businesses who want less regulation and people from the regulated companies get selected by republicans to regulate their industries.

<p>An ill-timed -- for Obama -- profile of former Fannie Mae CEO Franklin Raines, forced out in an accounting mess a few years ago.</p>
<p>The Style Section piece reports that he's recently been taking "calls from Barack Obama's presidential campaign seeking his advice on mortgage and housing policy matters."</p>
<p>Hard to find anybody in the mortgage industry who's looking real great right now, but Fannie Mae's critics, in particular, seem to have been vindicated.</p>

<p>I WANT EVERYONE TO BE WELL INFORMED THAT UNDER JIMMY CARTER THE TAX RATE WAS AT AROUND 70% WHEN RONALD REGAN TOOK OFFICE HE GOT THE TAX RATE DROPED IN 1981 TO 35% HE ALSO CLOSED MOST TAX LOOPHOLES THAT THE WEALTHIEST PEOPLE USED TO AVOID PAYING TAXES. THIS FORCED THESE PEOPLE TO INVEST IN THE FREE MARKET WHICH IN TURN BOOSTED THE AMERICAN ECONOMY EVEN MORE. SO IF YOU LOOK AT IT IN RETROSPECT RONALD REGAN IS THE REASON THE ECONOMY WAS SO GOOD FOR SO MANY YEARS. IMAGINE IF THE TAX RATE WAS STILL AT 70% BEFORE REGAN CHANGED THIS WE WOULD BE IN A HELL OF ALOT MORE TROUBLE THAN WE ARE IN RIGHT NOW. OH YEAH BY THE WAY RONALD REGAN WAS A REPUBLICAN!!!  </p>

<p>Take it away Republican Senator Chuck Hagel:</p>
<p>""I do think in a world that is so complicated, so interconnected and so combustible, you really got to have some people in charge that have some sense of the bigger scope of the world...I think that’s just a requirement.  I think it’s a stretch to, in any way, to say that she’s got the experience to be president of the United States.   I think they ought to just be honest about it and stop the nonsense about, 'I look out my window and I see Russia and so therefore I know something about Russia, That kind of thing is insulting to the American people. </p>
<p>[she]doesn’t have any foreign policy credentials. You get a passport for the first time in your life last year? I mean, I don’t know what you can say. You can’t say anything"</p>
<p></p>
<p>Exactly Rupublican Senator Hagel.......exactly.</p>
<p><br/>

<p>The truth about Obama is starting to come out. He recieved lots of campain money from Freddy and Fannie.</p>
<p>Obama is a slick lawyer...not ready to lead us. McCain has lots of experience...ready to lead. I don't agree with McCain all of the time but I do know he will do what's right for this country and he will act. In these times, we need a strong leader not a question mark. </p>

<p>The GOP, including all of McCain's economic advisors, believe in "unfettered capitalism," and they push deregulation with relentless passion. That's why we're so close right now to another Great Depression. Their belief is ideological, not rational. Sen. McCain is an ideologue regarding regulation. Thus, he can't change his mind about it, despite all the evidence of its destructiveness.</p>
<p>If we get through this present mess, the GOP, possibly led by Pres. McCain, will soon begin pushing again for deregulation, and in a decade or less, we'll have another financial catastrophe to deal with. Ideologues can't learn. This present meltdown will have no impact on their thinking. We need to elect rational people who recognize that capitalism is only a positive force when it's accompanied by sensible, logical oversight. McCain will never subscribe to this simple bit of logic.</p>
<p>If you're wondering right now where your retirement money went, look no further than John McCain and his fellow ideologues. They believe greed should be rewarded. They are directly responsible for our present misery.</p>

<p>Have we all lost our minds?  We are sooo divided right now; what are you Left or Right? I’m Neither.   Is that what really defines you.  Take a look inward; we all need some improvement and we all need to take responsibility for our actions.  I would expect the government to do the same.   We need to unite...WE WILL NEVER WIN AS A DIVIDED COUNTRY...we are literally fighting amongst ourselves.  Why not vote strictly on facts on the person not the party.  The past is the past we can’t change it.  We need to move forward.   I am tired of being "treated" by the media and politicians like I am unintelligent and that because of a fancy campaign ad or a good one-liner I am going to give you my vote.   No it doesn't work that way for me and it shouldn't work that way for you.  This is serious business we are not voting for the captain of a football team, we are voting for the top position of our country...yes OUR country...YOU and ME and everyone else that lives on this blessed land.   It’s not a Republican country or a Demographic country and I refused to be pigeon-holed into one position or another.  It’s the UNITED States…an American country.   We need some honest change.  Most of us are really suffering here and we need to all come together and but aside our differences and do what’s best for the whole and not just a select few.</p>

<p>This is easy. Do you believe that the Bible (such as is it) **PRIMARILY** is a literal record of pure fact -OR- a set of lessons and teachings relying heavily on metaphor to provide the foundation of a moral and spiritual life? If you believe the latter, then you will find that is the key difference between you and other people who call themselves Christians.</p>

<p>2005 USA Today article says it all<br/>
Read about Chris Cox the sec regulator<br/>
Big contributors to GOP reap big post-election rewards<br/>
By Jim Drinkard, USA TODAY<br/>
WASHINGTON — Just six months into a new term for President Bush and the Republican-controlled Congress, some of their heaviest donors are scoring victories on the legislative and regulatory fronts.<br/>
From rewrites of the laws governing bankruptcy and class-action lawsuits to relief for oil, timber and tobacco interests, GOP supporters who gave millions of dollars last year are reaping decisions worth billions from a Congress with more Republicans.</p>
<p>"Clearly, the election outcome has helped," says Bruce Josten, executive vice president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. "We are heading in the right direction. A lot more has been done by this time in a new session than usual."</p>
<p>While much public attention has been focused on Bush's sputtering effort to sell an overhaul of Social Security, legislation long sought by the GOP and its business allies have been enacted with bipartisan support. In February, Congress passed and Bush signed a bill that sharply limits class-action lawsuits. The savings will likely come to several billion dollars a year, says Russ Sutter of Tillinghast-Towers Perrin, an actuarial firm that studies tort costs.</p>
<p>The business sector that includes manufacturing and retail was among top GOP donors last election cycle. It directed three of every five political dollars to Republicans — almost $121 million, according to the non-partisan Center for Responsive Politics.</p>
<p>There was a similar partisan tilt in political giving by the finance industry, which won passage in April of a law making it harder to erase debts by declaring bankruptcy. Credit card companies and banks sought the change as a way to collect more debts.</p>
<p>The finance sector gave nearly $195 million to the GOP in the 2004 elections. And 105 of Bush's 548 elite fundraisers — those who raised $100,000 or more — were from the world of finance, making it his biggest base of top-dollar support, at $34 million.</p>
<p>"Many of the traditional business supporters are really getting the agenda they wanted, and it seems to be speeding up," says Larry Noble, director of the Center for Responsive Politics, which studies the impact of money on politics.</p>
<p>Still to come: Congress is pushing to complete an energy bill. Business interests want limits on liability for water contamination caused by MTBE, a fuel additive designed to reduce auto emissions, and oil companies seek to open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to drilling. The Senate passed its version Tuesday.</p>
<p>Bush supporters also have had good luck outside the legislative arena:</p>
<p>• Justice Department lawyers this month abruptly scaled back their request for a penalty in the government's lawsuit against tobacco companies. Rather than the 25-year, $130 billion smoking cessation program their own expert had recommended, they are asking for a $14 billion remedy. The tobacco industry favored Republicans three-to-one over Democrats last year, giving $2.7 million to the party and its candidates.</p>
<p>The Justice Department's Office of Professional Responsibility is looking into whether politics influenced the decision.</p>
<p>• After Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman William Donaldson resigned under fire from business groups who complained about overzealous regulation, Bush replaced him with someone with a pro-corporate record: Rep. Christopher Cox, R-Calif.</p>
<p>"It's hard to imagine somebody with a more nakedly deregulatory agenda," says William Lerach, a trial lawyer who has brought shareholder lawsuits against corporations accused of securities fraud. Securities and investment firms gave $47.8 million to Republicans last election.</p>
<p>• The administration last month reversed a ban on road construction, timber harvesting, mining and energy development on undeveloped national forest land. The government also has expanded oil and gas development on federal lands, including areas in New Mexico and Wyoming.</p>
<p>Energy and natural resources interests gave $39.3 million to the GOP last year, three times the amount given to Democrats.</p>

<p>Ya know what really ticks me off. That lo-life piece of ----Cox putting out a press release calling for a temporary ban on Naked Short Selling. I called up the SEC and was fighting with them for almost an hour. Why the hell is that moron calling for a temporary ban on something that’s 100% illegal. Somebody needs to drag Bush out of that White House and lock his a$$ up forever. Their robbing us blind and could care less about what anybody has to say about it. It's like Bush gave Wall Street a license to steal.<br/>

<p>I’m not about to say the Washington Post is not reputable because they publish great news articles. </p>
<p>In fact, here is an article from Donald Luskin (advisor to McCain) called “Quit Doling Out That Bad-Economy Line” supporting Phil Gramms statement that we ARE in a “Mental Recession”, and the economy is much better then we the American people are making it out to be. This commentary article was published on September 14th, 2008.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/09/12/AR2008091202415.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/09/12/AR2008091202415.html</a></p>
<p>September 15th, the banking system in our country collapsed.</p>
<p>Regardless of what party you belong to, open up your eyes for once. These people want nothing more than to help themselves. The financial cushion they ride on makes it impossible for them to connect with the average American which is apparent from his 3 page blast of people who are worried about our economy.</p>
<p>It truly terrifies me to think this is how they actually see the world.<br/>

<p>"oh yes, I forgot one other thing regarding "rich bastards" post. he mentioned that robert Riech didn't graduate with a degree in economics...........well, actually he did. From Dartmouth University.....just before he went to Oxford as a Rhodes Scholar."</p>
<p>Also, Robert Reich is a policy advocate. He does not crunch numbers all day - which is what most degree holding economists working as economists actually do (yes, I have a degree in Economics). As such having a law degree is much more relevant to what he actually does. Most economists collect data, analyze the data, and produce results which can be read by other people and used to argue policy.</p>
<p>You might try reading a peer journal article written by an economist in a journal of Econometrics. Lacking a solid graduate level foundation in statistics and calculus, you will likely not be able to discern it from a peer reviewed physics article. </p>
<p>My point is that you can talk about Economics based the results of research done by economists. You can be an expert in policy based on Economics without having a solid grasp of differential equations. Unless you are a profound genius with a startling aptitude for mathematics, you cannot be an research Economist without a graduate degree.</p>

<p>I guess "rich bastard" saw the error of his ways and cannot answer my simple question.   Apparently he just went and stuck his head in the sand because all he can do is run and hide from facts.  This is the true face of die hard republicans.  Show them the facts and they cut and run.</p>
<p>In case he missed my previous post, here it is again:</p>
<p><br/>
ONCE AGAIN "rich bastard" makes himself look foolish. Please check out this educatinal background and tell me how it prepares someone to be president. Use facts to back it up like say, for instance, "Sarah Palin graduated with a law degree and then taught constitional law for 12 years at one of the most prestigious law schools in the country. Being that this is a nation made up of constitutional law, this qualifies her to be president."</p>
<p>Something like that......Now I just made that up about her so you can't use that one. Here, this is a history of her education. </p>
<p>Ready? Go!!</p>
<p><br/>
SARAH PALINS OFFICIAL BIOGRAPHY ON MCCAIN/PALIN WEBSITE:</p>
<p>AND NOW FOR SARAH PALIN POTENTIAL VICE PRESIDENT (one heartbeat from the presidency - and I am not making any of this up this is in her official biography)</p>
<p>Palin attended Wasilla High School in Wasilla, a city[9] located 29 miles (47 km) north of the city of Anchorage. She was the head of the Fellowship of Christian Athletes chapter at the school and the point guard and captain of the school's girls' basketball team. She helped the team win the Alaska small-school basketball championship in 1982, hitting a critical free throw in the last seconds of the game, despite having an ankle stress fracture. She earned the nickname "Sarah Barracuda" because of her intense play; she was the leader of the team prayer before games.[10]</p>
<p>In 1982, Palin enrolled at Hawaii Pacific College but left after her first semester, transferring in 1983 to North Idaho College and then to the University of Idaho. She attended Matanuska-Susitna College in Alaska for one term, returning to the University of Idaho to complete her Bachelor of Science degree in communications-journalism, graduating in 1987.[11][12]</p>
<p>In 1984, Palin won the Miss Wasilla Pageant beauty contest,[13][14] then finished third (second runner-up) in the Miss Alaska pageant,[15][16] at which she won a college scholarship and the "Miss Congeniality" award.[17]</p>
<p>In 1988, she worked as a sports reporter for KTUU-TV in Anchorage, Alaska,[18] and for the Mat-Su Valley Frontiersman as a sports reporter.[19] She also helped in her husband’s commercial fishing family business.[20]</p>
<p><br/>
AND THIS INCREDIBLY UNQUALIFIED WOMAN MAY BE JUST ONE HEARTBEAT AWAY FROM RUNNING THE MOST POWERFUL COUNTRY IN THE WORLD.</p>

<p>From prior WA PO article:</p>
<p>7/16/08: “In the four years since he stepped down as Fannie Mae’s chief executive under the shadow of a $6.3 billion accounting scandal, Franklin D. Raines has been quietly constructing a new life for himself. He has shaved eight points off his golf handicap, taken a corner office in Steve Case’s D.C. conglomeration of finance, entertainment and health-care companies and more recently, taken calls from Barack Obama’s presidential campaign seeking his advice on mortgage and housing policy matters.” <br/>
8/28/08: “In the current crisis, their biggest backers have been Democrats such as Senate Banking Committee Chairman Christopher J. Dodd (Conn.) and House Financial Services Committee Chairman Barney Frank (Mass.). Two members of Mr. Obama’s political circle, James A. Johnson and Franklin D. Raines, are former chief executives of Fannie Mae.“ <br/>

<p>People, check the right information, Raines is NOT an advisor of Obama, that's another lie from your dear candidate that is so desperate that his only solution is to lie, lie, lie. If they were 2 kids, Mcsame and Obama, who do you think would be the strongest, smarter, and would succeed the most in life: the liar, to justify all his actions, or the one that gives solutions for problems?  Yeah, is that simple, OBAMA.</p>

<p>2005 USA Today article says it all<br/>
Read about Chris Cox the sec regulator<br/>
Big contributors to GOP reap big post-election rewards<br/>
By Jim Drinkard, USA TODAY<br/>
WASHINGTON — Just six months into a new term for President Bush and the Republican-controlled Congress, some of their heaviest donors are scoring victories on the legislative and regulatory fronts.<br/>
From rewrites of the laws governing bankruptcy and class-action lawsuits to relief for oil, timber and tobacco interests, GOP supporters who gave millions of dollars last year are reaping decisions worth billions from a Congress with more Republicans.</p>
<p>"Clearly, the election outcome has helped," says Bruce Josten, executive vice president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. "We are heading in the right direction. A lot more has been done by this time in a new session than usual."</p>
<p>While much public attention has been focused on Bush's sputtering effort to sell an overhaul of Social Security, legislation long sought by the GOP and its business allies have been enacted with bipartisan support. In February, Congress passed and Bush signed a bill that sharply limits class-action lawsuits. The savings will likely come to several billion dollars a year, says Russ Sutter of Tillinghast-Towers Perrin, an actuarial firm that studies tort costs.</p>
<p>The business sector that includes manufacturing and retail was among top GOP donors last election cycle. It directed three of every five political dollars to Republicans — almost $121 million, according to the non-partisan Center for Responsive Politics.</p>
<p>There was a similar partisan tilt in political giving by the finance industry, which won passage in April of a law making it harder to erase debts by declaring bankruptcy. Credit card companies and banks sought the change as a way to collect more debts.</p>
<p>The finance sector gave nearly $195 million to the GOP in the 2004 elections. And 105 of Bush's 548 elite fundraisers — those who raised $100,000 or more — were from the world of finance, making it his biggest base of top-dollar support, at $34 million.</p>
<p>"Many of the traditional business supporters are really getting the agenda they wanted, and it seems to be speeding up," says Larry Noble, director of the Center for Responsive Politics, which studies the impact of money on politics.</p>
<p>Still to come: Congress is pushing to complete an energy bill. Business interests want limits on liability for water contamination caused by MTBE, a fuel additive designed to reduce auto emissions, and oil companies seek to open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to drilling. The Senate passed its version Tuesday.</p>
<p>Bush supporters also have had good luck outside the legislative arena:</p>
<p>• Justice Department lawyers this month abruptly scaled back their request for a penalty in the government's lawsuit against tobacco companies. Rather than the 25-year, $130 billion smoking cessation program their own expert had recommended, they are asking for a $14 billion remedy. The tobacco industry favored Republicans three-to-one over Democrats last year, giving $2.7 million to the party and its candidates.</p>
<p>The Justice Department's Office of Professional Responsibility is looking into whether politics influenced the decision.</p>
<p>• After Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman William Donaldson resigned under fire from business groups who complained about overzealous regulation, Bush replaced him with someone with a pro-corporate record: Rep. Christopher Cox, R-Calif.</p>
<p>"It's hard to imagine somebody with a more nakedly deregulatory agenda," says William Lerach, a trial lawyer who has brought shareholder lawsuits against corporations accused of securities fraud. Securities and investment firms gave $47.8 million to Republicans last election.</p>
<p>• The administration last month reversed a ban on road construction, timber harvesting, mining and energy development on undeveloped national forest land. The government also has expanded oil and gas development on federal lands, including areas in New Mexico and Wyoming.</p>
<p>Energy and natural resources interests gave $39.3 million to the GOP last year, three times the amount given to Democrats.</p>

<p>I have another question !!!</p>
<p>Why is the McCain camp putting soooooooooooooooooooooo much effort into stalling testimoney into Palin's involvement in the Alaska "Trooper-gate" dilema? Nothing to hide ??? Then do the Deposition and get it behind you! Seems that would be a pretty big PLUS for the McCain - Palin ticket and would go a long, long, long ways to getting the both of them elected .... don't you think?<br/>

<p>The argument that you can tell who a person is by who they associate with is disputable in itself, and the extent, circumstances, and nature of the relationship are among the countless variables which we would have to consider before taking the argument seriously.</p>
<p>Stop with all the partisan bs.</p>
<p>Stop with all the attention to irrelevant and often far-fetched accusations.</p>
<p>Look at the policies the two parties pursue and cast your vote. Its useless to base your vote on what the candidates are saying right now. We KNOW what policies and ideologies guide the two parties, and we know that apples do not fall far from their tree (I think thats the saying, lol).</p>
<p>Particularly in this election, it appears the candidates will say just about anything to convince voters to side with them. Don't believe any one of them. 99.9999% of the time Presidents don't live up to most promises made during the campaign. Campaigns are allways short on the intricacies of policy for fear of putting voters to sleep, instead they focus on one liners, and rhetoric which can be interpreted many different ways. Often they say things which they don't really mean in order to convince some voters who are on the fence, and other times they don't say what they really mean in order to not offend voters who are on their side of the fence.</p>
<p>Look at the two parties and their solutions to the problems facing us. Stop bickering about personality. <br/>

<p>ONCE AGAIN "rich bastard" makes himself look foolish.   Please check out this educatinal background and tell me how it prepares someone to be president.   Use facts to back it up like say, for instance, "Sarah Palin graduated with a law degree and then taught constitional law for 12 years at one of the most prestigious law schools in the country.  Being that this is a nation made up of constitutional law, this qualifies her to be president."</p>
<p>Something like that......Now I just made that up about her so you can't use that one.  Here, this is a history of her education.   </p>
<p>Ready?   Go!!</p>
<p><br/>
SARAH PALINS OFFICIAL BIOGRAPHY ON MCCAIN/PALIN WEBSITE:</p>
<p>AND NOW FOR SARAH PALIN POTENTIAL VICE PRESIDENT (one heartbeat from the presidency - and I am not making any of this up this is in her official biography)</p>
<p>Palin attended Wasilla High School in Wasilla, a city[9] located 29 miles (47 km) north of the city of Anchorage. She was the head of the Fellowship of Christian Athletes chapter at the school and the point guard and captain of the school's girls' basketball team. She helped the team win the Alaska small-school basketball championship in 1982, hitting a critical free throw in the last seconds of the game, despite having an ankle stress fracture. She earned the nickname "Sarah Barracuda" because of her intense play; she was the leader of the team prayer before games.[10]</p>
<p>In 1982, Palin enrolled at Hawaii Pacific College but left after her first semester, transferring in 1983 to North Idaho College and then to the University of Idaho. She attended Matanuska-Susitna College in Alaska for one term, returning to the University of Idaho to complete her Bachelor of Science degree in communications-journalism, graduating in 1987.[11][12]</p>
<p>In 1984, Palin won the Miss Wasilla Pageant beauty contest,[13][14] then finished third (second runner-up) in the Miss Alaska pageant,[15][16] at which she won a college scholarship and the "Miss Congeniality" award.[17]</p>
<p>In 1988, she worked as a sports reporter for KTUU-TV in Anchorage, Alaska,[18] and for the Mat-Su Valley Frontiersman as a sports reporter.[19] She also helped in her husband’s commercial fishing family business.[20]</p>
<p><br/>
AND THIS INCREDIBLY UNQUALIFIED WOMAN MAY BE JUST ONE HEARTBEAT AWAY FROM RUNNING THE MOST POWERFUL COUNTRY IN THE WORLD.</p>

<p>McCain has become a one trick pony. He hears a sound somewhere, he runs to his video camera to say "I am John McCain, I approve this message" followed by a two or three line explanation of why Obama is related to that sound he just heard. Only a few weeks before the RNC convention McCain admitted that he does not know much about economics. Today he stands in front of a podium to explain his plans for financial recovery. This old guy does not have a formal education, has never taken a class in college in finance, economics or even on the constitution. His wife does not trust him with her finances. That is why they file separate tax returns.  I want McCain to explain the significance of 1989 in his life, to people who did not pay attention then. McCain was the mastermind of the Lincoln Savings and Loan disaster. Along with 4 other senators McCain helped Charles Keating milk billions of dollars from Lincoln savings and loan. McCain and his whole family including his nannies took free lavish vacations to Bahama and other places in a private jet provided by Charles Keating. In return McCain made sure that legislation and bills were passed to deregulate the banking industry. McCain to this day has not returned (other than a token amount) any of the money and perks he recieved from Keating. keating ended up spending 5 years in jail for that. McCains explanation about his part is that he had a lapse of judgement.</p>
<p>it is so funny. Crooks always think that others will not understand what they have done. Even after getting caught they continue to assert that they did nothing wrong.</p>
<p>McCain is not only the biggest crook when it comes to banking regulations and finance scandals, he pretends that he does not understand finance. But still he wants us to trust him with our kids future.</p>
<p>McCain should concentrate on Palin's derriere as he had been doing ever since Sarah Palin showed up on the election scene, and stay away from giving lip service to the country. McCain never fails to check out Palin's bum every opportunity he gets. What a moron and dirty old man he is.</p>

<p>Ted Kaczynski:<br/>
BS - Harvard<br/>
MS in Mathematics - U of Michigan<br/>
PhD in Mathematics - U of Michigan</p>
<p>Bill Gates:<br/>
College Dropout</p>
<p>Which one made more positive contributions to society? You have no credibility when you try to promote the intellectual superiority of your candidates based solely on how many sheepskins they have collected.</p>
<p>I'm well educated myself, and I've been interviewing and hiring people for many years for highly technical work. And what I've found is that judgment and experience are far more critical than a formal education for most positions that are not entry level.</p>
<p>If you hire people based solely on what degree they have or where they got that degree, you are either an elitist or a fool or both!</p>

<p>So what are you saying. John McCain is better suited for the job of president because he has more experience. Obama is a hundred times smarter than McCain, and with 8 years in the Ill. Senate, and almost 4 in the U.S. Senate, I'd say he knows how to do the job just as good as McCain. John McCain is a hot head, and has no business calling the shots when peoples lives are on the line. We already have a moron in the White House that’s responsible for the deaths of thousands of innocent people. <br/>

<p>Good God, I hope so.</p>
<p>It's not that she's a bad person, or a bad politician (in some ways, I wish she'd run for governor of Arkansas all those years ago).  But after 12 years of Bushes and 8 years of Clintons, I think we need new blood in the White House.  Either McCain or Obama fills that role.  The question is whether you believe that McCain would be so similar to Bush that he'd count as Bush 44.  I dunno about that, but Palin sure-nuf reminds me of Dick Cheney that it's scaring me into voting Obama.<br/>

<p>For Strange Days: You should read David Brooks column on the subject of experience, and what qualifies a person for the Presidency.</p>
<p>I agree with you that the job qualifications do not fit neatly into resume form. But Brooks points out that one of the key skills a President must have is 'prudence' based on experience with the subject matter. </p>
<p>I think this historical example goes right to the heart of the matter: When he was informed that Franklin Roosevelt wanted him to be the running mate on the 1944 Democratic ticket, Harry Truman declined the offer, saying that he did not consider himself qualified to be President. Roosevelt was very surprised (not accustomed to hearing anyone say 'no' to him), and he managed to persuade Senator Truman to accept his offer for the good of the nation. </p>
<p>History shows that Truman went on to be one of our great Presidents. The fact that he himself had the prudence to question Roosevelt's choice was probably the best indicator that he was indeed the right man for the job. Conversely, the fact that Gov. Palin actually believes herself to be qualified reinforces the case that she is not.</p>

<p>The argument that you can tell who a person is by who they associate with is disputable in itself, and the extent, circumstances, and nature of the relationship are among the countless variables which we would have to consider before taking the argument seriously.</p>
<p>Stop with all the partisan bs.</p>
<p>Stop with all the attention to irrelevant and often far-fetched accusations.</p>
<p>Look at the policies the two parties pursue and cast your vote.  Its useless to base your vote on what the candidates are saying right now.  We KNOW what policies and ideologies guide the two parties, and we know that apples do not fall far from their tree (I think thats the saying, lol).</p>
<p>Particularly in this election, it appears the candidates will say just about anything to convince voters to side with them.  Don't believe any one of them.  99.9999% of the time Presidents don't live up to most promises made during the campaign.  Campaigns are allways short on the intricacies of policy for fear of putting voters to sleep, instead they focus on one liners, and rhetoric which can be interpreted many different ways.  Often they say things which they don't really mean in order to convince some voters who are on the fence, and other times they don't say what they really mean in order to not offend voters who are on their side of the fence.</p>
<p>Look at the two parties and their solutions to the problems facing us.  Stop bickering about personality.  </p>

<p>2005 USA Today article says it all<br/>
Read about Chris Cox the sec regulator<br/>
Big contributors to GOP reap big post-election rewards<br/>
By Jim Drinkard, USA TODAY<br/>
WASHINGTON — Just six months into a new term for President Bush and the Republican-controlled Congress, some of their heaviest donors are scoring victories on the legislative and regulatory fronts.<br/>
From rewrites of the laws governing bankruptcy and class-action lawsuits to relief for oil, timber and tobacco interests, GOP supporters who gave millions of dollars last year are reaping decisions worth billions from a Congress with more Republicans.</p>
<p>"Clearly, the election outcome has helped," says Bruce Josten, executive vice president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. "We are heading in the right direction. A lot more has been done by this time in a new session than usual."</p>
<p>While much public attention has been focused on Bush's sputtering effort to sell an overhaul of Social Security, legislation long sought by the GOP and its business allies have been enacted with bipartisan support. In February, Congress passed and Bush signed a bill that sharply limits class-action lawsuits. The savings will likely come to several billion dollars a year, says Russ Sutter of Tillinghast-Towers Perrin, an actuarial firm that studies tort costs.</p>
<p>The business sector that includes manufacturing and retail was among top GOP donors last election cycle. It directed three of every five political dollars to Republicans — almost $121 million, according to the non-partisan Center for Responsive Politics.</p>
<p>There was a similar partisan tilt in political giving by the finance industry, which won passage in April of a law making it harder to erase debts by declaring bankruptcy. Credit card companies and banks sought the change as a way to collect more debts.</p>
<p>The finance sector gave nearly $195 million to the GOP in the 2004 elections. And 105 of Bush's 548 elite fundraisers — those who raised $100,000 or more — were from the world of finance, making it his biggest base of top-dollar support, at $34 million.</p>
<p>"Many of the traditional business supporters are really getting the agenda they wanted, and it seems to be speeding up," says Larry Noble, director of the Center for Responsive Politics, which studies the impact of money on politics.</p>
<p>Still to come: Congress is pushing to complete an energy bill. Business interests want limits on liability for water contamination caused by MTBE, a fuel additive designed to reduce auto emissions, and oil companies seek to open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to drilling. The Senate passed its version Tuesday.</p>
<p>Bush supporters also have had good luck outside the legislative arena:</p>
<p>• Justice Department lawyers this month abruptly scaled back their request for a penalty in the government's lawsuit against tobacco companies. Rather than the 25-year, $130 billion smoking cessation program their own expert had recommended, they are asking for a $14 billion remedy. The tobacco industry favored Republicans three-to-one over Democrats last year, giving $2.7 million to the party and its candidates.</p>
<p>The Justice Department's Office of Professional Responsibility is looking into whether politics influenced the decision.</p>
<p>• After Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman William Donaldson resigned under fire from business groups who complained about overzealous regulation, Bush replaced him with someone with a pro-corporate record: Rep. Christopher Cox, R-Calif.</p>
<p>"It's hard to imagine somebody with a more nakedly deregulatory agenda," says William Lerach, a trial lawyer who has brought shareholder lawsuits against corporations accused of securities fraud. Securities and investment firms gave $47.8 million to Republicans last election.</p>
<p>• The administration last month reversed a ban on road construction, timber harvesting, mining and energy development on undeveloped national forest land. The government also has expanded oil and gas development on federal lands, including areas in New Mexico and Wyoming.</p>
<p>Energy and natural resources interests gave $39.3 million to the GOP last year, three times the amount given to Democrats.</p>

<p>Report confirms Obama negotiated with Iraqi Foreign Minister Update: Taheri receiving death threats from Obama supporters<br/>
Sep 17, 2008 - Amir Taheri's September 15th has been, for all intents and purposes, confirmed over the past 24 hours. Obama did indeed conduct illegal foreign policy negotiations with Iraqi foreign minister Hoshyar Zebari. As we wrote on the 15th, this amounts to a truly audacious betrayal of the American people and our military, and deserves a full investigation by the American government, and scrutinization by the media. This from the American Spectator: <br/>
The Obama campaign spent more than five hours on Monday attempting to figure out the best refutation of the explosive New York Post report that quoted Iraqi Foreign Minister Hoshyar Zebari as saying that Barack Obama during his July visit to Baghdad demanded that Iraq not negotiate with the Bush Administration on the withdrawal of American troops. Instead, he asked that they delay such negotiations until after the presidential handover at the end of January.</p>
<p>The three problems, according to campaign sources: The report was true, there were at least three other people in the room with Obama and Zebari to confirm the conversation, and there was concern that there were enough aggressive reporters based in Baghdad with the sources to confirm the conversation that to deny the comments would create a bigger problem.<br/>
There you have it, corroborating witnesses were present. On top of this the report goes on to say that the Obama campaign is not even bothering to really deny the charges, simply spin it in the hopes that his media devotees will simply sweep it under the rug like every other scandal.</p>
<p>America really needs some reporters with the testicular fortitude to start an investigation. Is the media so in the tank for Obama that they would go out of there way to ignore what might be one of the biggest breaches of trust of a presidential candidate in American history?</p>
<p>Chris Mathews (in)famously complained to Pat Buchanan that media access to Governor Sarah Palin was necessary for the American people to make an informed decision about her. Is this very same media, which demanded Palin postulate in front of them for the good of the people, going to allow this bombshell to go unscrutinized, withholding what could be crucial information necessary to making an informed decision in November? If so, their hypocrisy is not only deep, but dangerous.</p>
<p>Update: Amir Taheri is receiving death threats from Obama supporters. In his follow up opinion piece in today's NY Post, Taheri writes:<br/>
While I am encouraged by the senator's evolution, I must also appeal to him to issue a "cease and desist" plea to the battalions of his sympathizers - who have been threatening me with death and worse in the days since my article appeared.</p>

<p>BTW, I watched a speech this morning where McCain made these charges. He was introduced by Gov. Palin, and her speech was meandering and filled with flattery and fluff, but not much substance. So far, it appears that Senator McCain can't risk making a campaign appearance on his own because they've figured out that absent the "Hockey Mom with Lipstick" as the opening act, there will be no audience for Act 2. I think that's an issue which bears some discussion.</p>

<p>"If you hire people based solely on what degree they have or where they got that degree, you are either an elitist or a fool or both!"</p>
<p>This is sort of misleading. For a leadership position, this really can't be taught - no Havard degree would make you a great leader. For a technical position, it is the single most important criterion unless the candidate has demonstrable experience in exactly what you want him or her to do.</p>
<p>The JPL, for example, would do better hiring a top notch recent graduate from MIT with a concentration in rocket engineering over Bill Gates. </p>
<p>As for the presidency, there is no job that really prepared one for president except for, perhaps, working closely with a president. None of these candidates have any really significant experience that correlates with being president.</p>
<p>Being a legislator is very different, although it gives you insight on how to push legislation. Being a governor of a state with a small population is as different from president as running a small business is from being CEO of IBM, although it gives you some insight on how to act as an executive.</p>
<p>Now that we've established that no one in this election really has truly relevant experience and that leadership is something you learn and develop not through school, the choice really boils down to looking at policy positions and past judgment.</p>

<p>let me go ahead and repost Sarah Palin's bio in case any republicans wanted to refresh their memory on how qualified she is:</p>
<p>SARAH PALINS OFFICIAL BIOGRAPHY ON MCCAIN/PALIN WEBSITE:</p>
<p>AND NOW FOR SARAH PALIN POTENTIAL VICE PRESIDENT (one heartbeat from the presidency - and I am not making any of this up this is in her official biography)</p>
<p>Palin attended Wasilla High School in Wasilla, a city[9] located 29 miles (47 km) north of the city of Anchorage. She was the head of the Fellowship of Christian Athletes chapter at the school and the point guard and captain of the school's girls' basketball team. She helped the team win the Alaska small-school basketball championship in 1982, hitting a critical free throw in the last seconds of the game, despite having an ankle stress fracture. She earned the nickname "Sarah Barracuda" because of her intense play; she was the leader of the team prayer before games.[10]</p>
<p>In 1982, Palin enrolled at Hawaii Pacific College but left after her first semester, transferring in 1983 to North Idaho College and then to the University of Idaho. She attended Matanuska-Susitna College in Alaska for one term, returning to the University of Idaho to complete her Bachelor of Science degree in communications-journalism, graduating in 1987.[11][12]</p>
<p>In 1984, Palin won the Miss Wasilla Pageant beauty contest,[13][14] then finished third (second runner-up) in the Miss Alaska pageant,[15][16] at which she won a college scholarship and the "Miss Congeniality" award.[17]</p>
<p>In 1988, she worked as a sports reporter for KTUU-TV in Anchorage, Alaska,[18] and for the Mat-Su Valley Frontiersman as a sports reporter.[19] She also helped in her husband’s commercial fishing family business.[20]</p>
<p><br/>
AND THIS INCREDIBLY UNQUALIFIED WOMAN MAY BE JUST ONE HEARTBEAT AWAY FROM RUNNING THE MOST POWERFUL COUNTRY IN THE WORLD.</p>

<p>And this is the guy who wants to lead us out of another financial debacle?</p>
<p>Please.</p>
<p>From Wikipedia:<br/>
McCain became enmeshed in a scandal during the 1980s as one of five United States Senators comprising the so-called "Keating Five".[86] Between 1982 and 1987, McCain had received $112,000 in lawful[87] political contributions from Charles Keating Jr. and his associates at Lincoln Savings and Loan Association, along with trips on Keating's jets[86] that McCain belatedly repaid two years later.[88] In 1987, McCain was one of the five senators whom Keating contacted in order to prevent the government's seizure of Lincoln, and McCain met twice with federal regulators to discuss the government's investigation of Lincoln.[86] On his Keating Five experience, McCain has said: "The appearance of it was wrong. It's a wrong appearance when a group of senators appear in a meeting with a group of regulators, because it conveys the impression of undue and improper influence. And it was the wrong thing to do."[89] In the end, McCain was cleared by the Senate Ethics Committee of acting improperly or violating any law or Senate rule, but was mildly rebuked for exercising "poor judgment".[89][87] <br/>

<p>I've been a voting Republican since 1971. Until this year, I was a big supporter of John McCain. Yesterday, I looked up the Bill he co-sponsored in 2005 with respect to F&amp;F and at least the rhetoric of his endorsement speech in the Congressional Record sounded good. Quite clearly Senator McCain was well aware of the improprieties and conflicts of interest going on at the GSE's. As I understand it, the Bill never even came up for a vote. Does co-sponsoring a Bill and then letting it die constitute challenging his party? I don't think so. John McCain has plenty of clout back there. If he wanted to, he could have gone public and said "There's fraud being committed, and the Bush administration is doing nothing about it."</p>
<p>The last action on that Bill was taken in July of 2005, while the Republicans still controlled Congress. As I see it, John McCain got what he wanted out of the Bill: an entry in the Congressional Record he could use later, and of course he is. Today, he used to to "prove" that he's been trying to reform Washington all along. But where was the outrage back then? (Nonexistent)</p>
<p>Then he said Senator Obama was doing nothing while he was trying to fight corruption. Well that was a bald faced lie. The Feb, 2006 version of Obama's 'STOP FRAUD' Bill would have tightened reporting and accountability standards for lenders on mortgages. It's scope was too limited, but it demonstrated that Obama was on to the mortgage lending industry, and he did something about it. The April, 2007 revision of the bill went much further, including requirements for proof of the creditworthiness of sub-prime borrowers, and analysis of their ability to pay 7-10 years into the loans. That bill never got voted on either. I don't know why, but I can guess. What did the freshman Senator from Illinois do? He ran for President. (John McCain keeps saying Obama has never challenged is own party. I think Hillary Clinton might differ with him on that point.)<br/>

We can see that Sen McCain picked Gov. Sarah Palin for the milage it would get him with the women voter`s with the realisation that women constitut of a high persentage of the voters now that seems not to be working and the focus is trully on the issue that deems what  may be rationably the highest concern for many Americans (next to the War)he (Sen Mccain) is scrambeling for tactic that would gain popularity with the American voters and so is stateing all sorts of half truths and unsubstantiated statements in his adds, now it is ture that sen Obama has associated at some time or the other with individuals who have done things in their buissness dealings that is far from reputable but so has Sen Mccain i trully hope that come november the American people will really chose the real advocate of Change.</p>

<p>TED KAZINSKY'S BIO (By the way, he was a registered Republican and his manifesto attacks the left)</p>
<p>Hmmmmmm....who else claims to be a backwoods person in this campaign?</p>
<p>In the summer of 1969, Kaczynski moved to his parents' small residence in Lombard, Illinois. Two years later, in 1971, he moved into a remote cabin he built himself in Lincoln, Montana, where he lived a simple life on very little money, with no electricity and no running water, feeding himself as a hunter-gatherer. Kaczynski also worked odd jobs and received financial support from his family (including purchasing his land and, without their knowledge, funding his bombing campaign). In 1978, he worked very briefly with his father and brother at a foam-rubber factory.[7]<br/>

<p>COMMON SENSE<br/>
---------------<br/>
Beginning in 1992, Obama taught constitutional law at the University of Chicago Law School for twelve years, being first classified as a Lecturer from 1992 to 1996, and then as a Senior Lecturer from 1996 to 2004.[25]<br/>
---------------</p>
<p>So how many times have we heard 0bama stating that he was a "professor" in constitutional law?  Well obviously he was not ... don't these "misrepresentations" bother anyone?</p>
<p>Please, spare me the explanation that people won't understand what a lecturer is ... we're not all "under-educated".</p>
<p>What was that re NAFTA again in the primaries? 0bama says he'll renegotiate, then send his flunky to re-assure the Canadians.</p>
<p>should I go on ...?</p>
<p>This is not about education, this is about character and a track record to back it up.  Not speeches an inaccuracies and huge egos.<br/>

<p>BILL GATES BIOGRAPHY - I would like to compare his SAT scores against Palin and McCain anyday.</p>
<p>Gates graduated from Lakeside School in 1973. He scored 1590 out of 1600 on the Scholastic Aptitude Test[15] and subsequently enrolled at Harvard College in the fall of 1973.[16] While at Harvard, he met his future business partner, Steve Ballmer, whom he later appointed as CEO of Microsoft. He also met computer scientist Christos Papadimitriou at Harvard, with whom he collaborated on a paper about algorithms.[17] He did not have a definite study plan while a student at Harvard[18] and spent a lot of time using the school's computers. He remained in contact with Paul Allen, joining him at Honeywell during the summer of 1974.[19] The following year saw the release of the MITS Altair 8800 based on the Intel 8080 CPU, and Gates and Allen saw this as the opportunity to start their own computer software company.[20] He had talked this decision over with his parents, who were supportive of him after seeing how much Gates wanted to start a company.[18]Dropped out of Harvard June 1975 [19].</p>
<p>Gates has received honorary doctorates from Nyenrode Business Universiteit, Breukelen, The Netherlands in 2000,[58] the Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden in 2002, Waseda University, Tokyo, Japan in 2005, Harvard University in June 2007,[59] and from Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, in January 2008.[60] Gates was also made an honorary Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE) from Queen Elizabeth II in 2005,[61] in addition to having entomologists name the Bill Gates flower fly, Eristalis gatesi, in his honor.[62]</p>
<p>In November 2006, he and his wife were awarded the Order of the Aztec Eagle for their philanthropic work around the world in the areas of health and education, particularly in Mexico, and specifically in the program "Un país de lectores".[63]</p>
<p>THERE HAVE BEEN NO HONORY DOCTORATES GIVEN TO MCCAIN OR PALIN.</p>

<p>While McCain voted for Bush's failed policies 90% of the time (by his own admission), his campaign claims that Obama has never stood up to the Democratic Party (not true--He has voted independently a number of times). But apparently it hasn't occurred to the McCain crowd that in voting with the Democrats, Obama was voting AGAINST the Bush policies. He didn't need to stand up to his party, because his party has been right most of the time.</p>

<p>BARAK OBAMAS EDUCATION - (I HAVE EDITED OUT SEVERAL PARAGRAPHS OF COMMUNITY SERVICE WORKS TO JUST TO CONDENSE INTO MANAGABLE READING)</p>
<p></p>
<p>Barak Obama's education and experience for President:</p>
<p>Following high school, Obama moved to Los Angeles, where he studied at Occidental College for two years.[10] He then transferred to Columbia University in New York City, where he majored in political science with a specialization in international relations.[11] Obama graduated with a B.A. from Columbia in 1983, then worked for a year at the Business International Corporation[12] and then at the New York Public Interest Research Group.[13][14]</p>
<p>After four years in New York City, Obama moved to Chicago to work as a community organizer for three years from June 1985 to May 1988 as director of the Developing Communities Project (DCP), a church-based community organization originally comprising eight Catholic parishes in Greater Roseland (Roseland, West Pullman, and Riverdale) on Chicago's far South Side.[13][15] During his three years as the DCP's director, its staff grew from 1 to 13 and its annual budget grew from $70,000 to $400,000, with accomplishments including helping set up a job training program, a college preparatory tutoring program, and a tenants' rights organization in Altgeld Gardens.[16]</p>
<p>Obama entered Harvard Law School in late 1988. At the end of his first year, he was selected, based on his grades and a writing competition, as an editor of the Harvard Law Review.[19] In February 1990, in his second year, he was elected president of the Law Review, a full-time volunteer position functioning as editor-in-chief and supervising the Law Review's staff of 80 editors.[20] During his summers, he returned to Chicago where he worked as a summer associate at the law firms of Sidley &amp; Austin in 1989 and Hopkins &amp; Sutter in 1990.[21] </p>
<p>After graduating with a Juris Doctor (J.D.) magna cum laude from Harvard in 1991, he returned to Chicago.</p>
<p><br/>
Obama directed Illinois' Project Vote from April to October 1992, a voter registration drive with a staff of 10 and 700 volunteers; it achieved its goal of registering 150,000 of 400,000 unregistered African-Americans in the state, and led to Crain's Chicago Business naming Obama to its 1993 list of "40 under Forty" powers to be.[23][24]</p>
<p>Beginning in 1992, Obama taught constitutional law at the University of Chicago Law School for twelve years, being first classified as a Lecturer from 1992 to 1996, and then as a Senior Lecturer from 1996 to 2004.[25]</p>
<p>He also, in 1993, joined Davis, Miner, Barnhill &amp; Galland, a 12-attorney law firm specializing in civil rights litigation and neighborhood economic development, where he was an associate for three years from 1993 to 1996, then of counsel from 1996 to 2004, with his law license becoming inactive in 2002.[13][26]</p>

<p>Obama is intelligent and takes his advice from brilliant folks like the previous poster mentioned Warren Buffet, Reich, And Volcker. I take this trio over Phil Gramm. I am disgusted by Mc Cain having sold his soul to the evangelicals he use to call agents of intolerance and now he has become a desperate liar. The sheen is off Palins distraction bloom and Mc Same has nothing left but to lie through his teeth. Mc Cain has flip flopped on the bailouts just this week. He wants us to keep spending 12 billion a month forever in Iraq a war we were lied into. Mc Same wrong as George W. on damn near every issue. This Latino veteran will line up with Barack Obama and hope for better days than the ones brought upon us by these Republican liars. SI SE PUEDE! YES WE MUST CHANGE AHORA!</p>

<p>SARAH PALINS OFFICIAL BIOGRAPHY ON MCCAIN/PALIN WEBSITE:</p>
<p>AND NOW FOR SARAH PALIN POTENTIAL VICE PRESIDENT (one heartbeat from the presidency - and I am not making any of this up this is in her official biography)</p>
<p>Palin attended Wasilla High School in Wasilla, a city[9] located 29 miles (47 km) north of the city of Anchorage. She was the head of the Fellowship of Christian Athletes chapter at the school and the point guard and captain of the school's girls' basketball team. She helped the team win the Alaska small-school basketball championship in 1982, hitting a critical free throw in the last seconds of the game, despite having an ankle stress fracture. She earned the nickname "Sarah Barracuda" because of her intense play; she was the leader of the team prayer before games.[10]</p>
<p>In 1982, Palin enrolled at Hawaii Pacific College but left after her first semester, transferring in 1983 to North Idaho College and then to the University of Idaho. She attended Matanuska-Susitna College in Alaska for one term, returning to the University of Idaho to complete her Bachelor of Science degree in communications-journalism, graduating in 1987.[11][12]</p>
<p>In 1984, Palin won the Miss Wasilla Pageant beauty contest,[13][14] then finished third (second runner-up) in the Miss Alaska pageant,[15][16] at which she won a college scholarship and the "Miss Congeniality" award.[17]</p>
<p>In 1988, she worked as a sports reporter for KTUU-TV in Anchorage, Alaska,[18] and for the Mat-Su Valley Frontiersman as a sports reporter.[19] She also helped in her husband’s commercial fishing family business.[20]</p>
<p></p>
<p>AND THIS INCREDIBLY UNQUALIFIED WOMAN MAY BE JUST ONE HEARTBEAT AWAY FROM RUNNING THE MOST POWERFUL COUNTRY IN THE WORLD.</p>

This shows how forward thinking Obama's campaign is. If years ago they called Fannie Mae CEO for advice. I think this looks good for Obama when compared to McCain who looks like he couldn't be less prepared. Looks better than the 20 McCain staffers who were paid 12 million in lobbyist fees from F Mae and F Mac. </p>

<p>The Washington Post's own stories below talk about the Obama/Raines relationship...</p>
<p>7/16/08: “In the four years since he stepped down as Fannie Mae’s chief executive under the shadow of a $6.3 billion accounting scandal, Franklin D. Raines has been quietly constructing a new life for himself. He has shaved eight points off his golf handicap, taken a corner office in Steve Case’s D.C. conglomeration of finance, entertainment and health-care companies and more recently, taken calls from Barack Obama’s presidential campaign seeking his advice on mortgage and housing policy matters.” </p>
<p>8/28/08: “In the current crisis, their biggest backers have been Democrats such as Senate Banking Committee Chairman Christopher J. Dodd (Conn.) and House Financial Services Committee Chairman Barney Frank (Mass.). Two members of Mr. Obama’s political circle, James A. Johnson and Franklin D. Raines, are former chief executives of Fannie Mae.“ <br/>

<p>Interesting people still going after Palin...hey did you pay extra taxes?  If not your not patriotic according to Biden!</p>
<p>The Raines-Johnson-Obama connection was reported by the Washington Post itself!  Is Howard Kurtz ready and willing to lead the charge that the Washington Post is not a credible paper?</p>
<p>Fannie Mae was going downhill thanks to Raines and he was busted for it, Johnson improved it...so he could better pocket millions of dollars, and Obama does have these two as his advisors.</p>
<p>And I love the charge of "say anything" since Obama continues to love to make up stories as he goes...his latest that HE was the one responsible for the stimulus package...or was it his Banking committee...in the state of New Pennsylvania, home of the "Nitaly" Lions...</p>

<p>Do Mc Cain and his campaign team ever run out of lies to hurl. they are desperately trying to distract America from the truth. Raines has never ever been any kind of advisor to Obama. Obama has Warren Buffet, Robert Reich, and Paul Volcker on his economic advisory team and that easily trumps Mc Same and his advisor and sidekick Phil Gramm who wrote his economic plan. A huge factor in all the economic mess is the 500 billion dollar so far cost of the war in Iraq which we were lied into. No Weapons of Mass Destruction no ties to Al Qaeda and now a big bill to pay to say nothing of the 5000 of our troops lives and over 35,000 injured or maimed. Time to throw the Republican bums who took a 290 billion dollar surplus and turned it into a 500 billion and counting deficit out NOW! YES WE CAN bring the economy back to its senses. Vote Hope America vote for Barack Obama don't let the steady stream of made up lies coming out of the Mc Cain campaign distract us from the missions at hand.</p>

<p>Most of this heat IS carried by "dumb" people (smartwomenformccain), as is evidenced by your failure to read the article (the part debunking the "advising"), and by the truculent twerps chanting "Keating"... Read the actual record. Fact is, handing regulatory, and therefore government functionality, over to the industries to be regulated is as uninformed as continuing to subscribe to the drunken fairy tale of piddle-down economics. McCain himself said at the time of Keating that his involvement was the result of poor judgement. I see this kind of lie as evidence of a continued lack of judgement.</p>

<p>Hey, McCain said Obama voted 94 times to raise taxes, and lied about every one. Can you imagine Obama being tied to the mortgage mess when he has nothing to do with it. The press is going to run with this bull story because McCain is getting his a$$ kicked. He don't care about the truth, only the headlines that put doubt in peoples minds. Now Gramm is tied to McCain, and we all know that he advises him. Gramm is responsible for all of this mess, and Obama should set the record straight.</p>

<p>Both campaigns have stretched, mangled, and perhaps even fabricated on the campaign trail.  Things will be said and promises will be made to get elected. That is the game of politics.  BUT if you were an employer (which in essence we are) and had to hire one of these teams you would look at experience AND education.<br/>
so lets take a look:<br/>
Barack Obama</p>
<p>    * Occidental College - Two years<br/>
    * Columbia University - B.A. Political science with a specialization in international relations.<br/>
    * Harvard - Juris Doctor (J.D.) Magna Cum Laude</p>
<p>Joe Biden</p>
<p>    * University of Delaware - B.A. History<br/>
    * University of Delaware - B.A. Political Science<br/>
    * Syracuse University College of Law - Juris Doctor (J.D.)</p>
<p>John McCain</p>
<p>    * United States Naval Academy - Class rank 894 of 899</p>
<p>Sarah Palin</p>
<p>    * Hawaii Pacific University - 1 semester<br/>
    * North Idaho College - 2 semesters - general study<br/>
    * University of Idaho - 2 semesters - journalism<br/>
    * Matanuska-Susitna College - 1 semester<br/>
    * University of Idaho - 3 semesters - B.A. Journalism</p>
<p>As an employer WE have to assess both teams and at this point in time I think Political Science is a little more important...</p>

<p>Chris: "Five of America's dumbest people will be fooled by this ad, and that's about it."</p>
<p>You're joking, right?  There are at least five believers on this board alone.  The fact is this crap works because the media is too scared/incompetent/lazy to challenge such claims for fear of being accused of liberal bias (hint to media: you'll be accused of that no matter what you do, SO IGNORE IT).  If they were doing one tenth of their job the GOP would be laughed out of government in November.  </p>

<p>You should check McSame Keating 5 Scandal. Maybe you choose to ignore it, but we don't.</p>
<p>Keating went to jail.<br/>
Bilions and trillion spend to fix the problem McCain helped create.</p>
<p>Obama is a great guy. He stays true to his nature because he said he would run a principle campaign. The other party made reference to his faith, his pastor,  his patriotic conviction, his race, his elitism, but he chose not to fire at them. Why? </p>
<p>Because he want to lead not divide this nation. </p>

<p>Lets compare each tickets educational bio's shall we:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Barak Obama's education and experience for President:</p>
<p>Following high school, Obama moved to Los Angeles, where he studied at Occidental College for two years.[10] He then transferred to Columbia University in New York City, where he majored in political science with a specialization in international relations.[11] Obama graduated with a B.A. from Columbia in 1983, then worked for a year at the Business International Corporation[12] and then at the New York Public Interest Research Group.[13][14]</p>
<p>After four years in New York City, Obama moved to Chicago to work as a community organizer for three years from June 1985 to May 1988 as director of the Developing Communities Project (DCP), a church-based community organization originally comprising eight Catholic parishes in Greater Roseland (Roseland, West Pullman, and Riverdale) on Chicago's far South Side.[13][15] During his three years as the DCP's director, its staff grew from 1 to 13 and its annual budget grew from $70,000 to $400,000, with accomplishments including helping set up a job training program, a college preparatory tutoring program, and a tenants' rights organization in Altgeld Gardens.[16]</p>
<p>Obama entered Harvard Law School in late 1988. At the end of his first year, he was selected, based on his grades and a writing competition, as an editor of the Harvard Law Review.[19] In February 1990, in his second year, he was elected president of the Law Review, a full-time volunteer position functioning as editor-in-chief and supervising the Law Review's staff of 80 editors.[20]  During his summers, he returned to Chicago where he worked as a summer associate at the law firms of Sidley &amp; Austin in 1989 and Hopkins &amp; Sutter in 1990.[21] </p>
<p>After graduating with a Juris Doctor (J.D.) magna cum laude from Harvard in 1991, he returned to Chicago.</p>
<p><br/>
Obama directed Illinois' Project Vote from April to October 1992, a voter registration drive with a staff of 10 and 700 volunteers; it achieved its goal of registering 150,000 of 400,000 unregistered African-Americans in the state, and led to Crain's Chicago Business naming Obama to its 1993 list of "40 under Forty" powers to be.[23][24]</p>
<p>Beginning in 1992, Obama taught constitutional law at the University of Chicago Law School for twelve years, being first classified as a Lecturer from 1992 to 1996, and then as a Senior Lecturer from 1996 to 2004.[25]</p>
<p>He also, in 1993, joined Davis, Miner, Barnhill &amp; Galland, a 12-attorney law firm specializing in civil rights litigation and neighborhood economic development, where he was an associate for three years from 1993 to 1996, then of counsel from 1996 to 2004, with his law license becoming inactive in 2002.[13][26]</p>
<p></p>
<p><br/>
Joe Biden's experience for Vice President (one heartbeat away from the presidency):</p>
<p>Biden attended the University of Delaware in Newark,[10] where by his own later description he was a lazy student.[11] He graduated with a Bachelor of Arts with a double major in history and political science in 1965,[2] ranked 506th of 688 in his class.[12]</p>
<p>He went on to receive his Juris Doctor from Syracuse University College of Law in 1968,[10] where by his own description he again underperformed and ranked 76th of 85 students.[11][13] </p>
<p></p>
<p><br/>
John McCains education for president:</p>
<p>Following in the footsteps of his father and grandfather, McCain entered the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis. There, he was a friend and informal leader for many of his classmates,[9] and sometimes stood up for people who were being bullied.[4] He also became a lightweight boxer.[10] McCain came into conflict with higher-ranking personnel, he did not always obey the rules, and that contributed to a low class rank (894 of 899) despite a strong intelligence.[9][11] He did well in academic subjects that interested him, such as literature and history, but studied only enough to pass subjects he struggled with, such as mathematics.[4][12] McCain graduated in 1958.[9]</p>
<p>McCain's pre-combat duty began when he was commissioned an ensign, and started two and a half years of training at Pensacola as a naval aviator.[13] While there, he earned a reputation as a partying man.[6] He completed flight school in 1960, and became a naval pilot of ground-attack aircraft, assigned to A-1 Skyraider squadrons[14] aboard the aircraft carriers USS Intrepid and USS Enterprise[15] in the Caribbean and Mediterranean Seas.[16] The planes he was flying crashed twice and once collided with power lines, but he received no major injuries.[16]</p>
<p></p>
<p>AND NOW FOR SARAH PALIN POTENTIAL VICE PRESIDENT (one heartbeat from the presidency -  and I am not making any of this up this is in her official biography)</p>
<p>Palin attended Wasilla High School in Wasilla, a city[9] located 29 miles (47 km) north of the city of Anchorage. She was the head of the Fellowship of Christian Athletes chapter at the school and the point guard and captain of the school's girls' basketball team. She helped the team win the Alaska small-school basketball championship in 1982, hitting a critical free throw in the last seconds of the game, despite having an ankle stress fracture. She earned the nickname "Sarah Barracuda" because of her intense play; she was the leader of the team prayer before games.[10]</p>
<p>In 1982, Palin enrolled at Hawaii Pacific College but left after her first semester, transferring in 1983 to North Idaho College and then to the University of Idaho. She attended Matanuska-Susitna College in Alaska for one term, returning to the University of Idaho to complete her Bachelor of Science degree in communications-journalism, graduating in 1987.[11][12]</p>
<p>In 1984, Palin won the Miss Wasilla Pageant beauty contest,[13][14] then finished third (second runner-up) in the Miss Alaska pageant,[15][16] at which she won a college scholarship and the "Miss Congeniality" award.[17]</p>
<p>In 1988, she worked as a sports reporter for KTUU-TV in Anchorage, Alaska,[18] and for the Mat-Su Valley Frontiersman as a sports reporter.[19] She also helped in her husband’s commercial fishing family business.[20]</p>
<p></p>
<p><br/>
AND THIS INCREDIBLY UNQUALIFIED WOMAN MAY BE JUST ONE HEARTBEAT AWAY FROM RUNNING THE MOST POWERFUL COUNTRY IN THE WORLD.<br/>

<p>He will go down in history as THE WORST PRESIDENT OF MODERN TIMES.  along with the republicans as the party of exclusion, excess and mistrust.  Reps, get used to it, your hey day is over.</p>

<p>Excuse me, MCCAIN is at fault here? How many times has Obama attacked McCain on grounds of not having experience or understanding of economics? And how many of us have heard (more than once) about Phil Gramm, huh? Or Keating 5? </p>
<p>Please. If Obama can dish it he better be prepared to take it.</p>
<p>Raines isn't even the ONLY connection Obama has to Fannie. He's got another former CEO... remember the guy he originally CHOSE TO HEAD HIS VP SEARCH he's still an adviser... but even if he weren't now, how can anyone say that Obama had a negligible relationship if he wanted him to take such a key role?</p>
<p>And where is all the outrage about Penny Pritzker being Obama's national finance chair? If she had any connection to McCain, Obama would be all over it.</p>
<p>I bet the folks who lost their money thru the Pritzker's foray into subprime lending are loving her still having her billions... still donating away to politicians. That's gotta sting.</p>
<p>And that's in ADDITION to Obama being #2 on the list of fannie contributions. And that's over how many years? How many has Obama been there? Do the math. He sure hit the top fast.</p>
<p>If McCain can be called out repeatedly for simply "hiring lobbyists"... why can't anyone point out the folks Obama is surrounding himself with??? either his famous judgment is pretty bad, or he doesn't actually care. </p>

Sorry, but that is a fact, not "nonsensical conjecture."  Have you not seen the video of McSame saying that he voted with Bush over 90% of the time?!!</p>
<p>McSame is just another Bush.... he is just lying as much as he can get away with to distance himself from Bush, because he knows he will surely lose if voters recognize that he is infact a Bush clone.<br/>

<p>Eric, why are you so selfish?  Wah, your preferred candidate isn't running.</p>
<p>Would you really go through 4 more years of the same - or worse - just to get your favorite candidate elected in 2012?  Give McCain/Palin 4 years and the damage to this country may be so great that Hillary may not even stand a chance in 2012.</p>

<p>Eric,<br/>
Get over it.  You seem to send the same message about electing Hillary in 2012.  We do not have the luxury of allowing McPain to serve and ruin our country.  Hillary Clinton served this country well during the eight years as the First Lady, and now as the Junior Senator of the Great State of New York.  </p>
<p>We need to rid our country of the Republican virus.  They are a disease to our social fabric.  Palin stated her proximity to Russian provided her with foreign policy experience.  Her husband Todd does not want to appear before the state investigator.  Imagine, the state investigator asking us to appear, we would be so afraid.  The rules do not apply to Rove, Mier, Chenney, and now Todd.  This virus exposed the career of one of our  CIA agents.  These folks are not loyal american citizens.  They do not want to pay their fair share of taxes, they want to pollute our air, waters, etc.  </p>
<p>They are a bunch of greedy slimy, unpatriotic wealthy individualist.</p>

<p>Do You Know About This Scam?<br/>
***************************</p>
<p>Obama’s Global Tax Proposal Up for Senate Vote</p>
<p><br/>
Accuracy in Media Column | By Cliff Kincaid | February 12, 2008 </p>
<p><br/>
A nice-sounding bill called the "Global Poverty Act," sponsored by Democratic presidential candidate and Senator Barack Obama, is up for a Senate vote on Thursday and could result in the imposition of a global tax on the United States. The bill, which has the support of many liberal religious groups, makes levels of U.S. foreign aid spending subservient to the dictates of the United Nations. </p>
<p>Senator Joe Biden, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, has not endorsed either Senator Barack Obama or Hillary Clinton in the presidential race. But on Thursday, February 14, he is trying to rush Obama's "Global Poverty Act" (S.2433) through his committee. The legislation would commit the U.S. to spending 0.7 percent of gross national product on foreign aid, which amounts to a phenomenal 13-year total of $845 billion over and above what the U.S. already spends. </p>
<p>The bill, which is item number four on the committee's business meeting agenda, passed the House by a voice vote last year because most members didn't realize what was in it. Congressional sponsors have been careful not to calculate the amount of foreign aid spending that it would require. According to the website of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, no hearings have been held on the Obama bill in that body. </p>
<p>A release from the Obama Senate office about the bill declares, "In 2000, the U.S. joined more than 180 countries at the United Nations Millennium Summit and vowed to reduce global poverty by 2015. We are halfway towards this deadline, and it is time the United States makes it a priority of our foreign policy to meet this goal and help those who are struggling day to day." </p>
<p>The legislation itself requires the President "to develop and implement a comprehensive strategy to further the United States foreign policy objective of promoting the reduction of global poverty, the elimination of extreme global poverty, and the achievement of the Millennium Development Goal of reducing by one-half the proportion of people worldwide, between 1990 and 2015, who live on less than $1 per day." </p>
<p>The bill defines the term "Millennium Development Goals" as the goals set out in the United Nations Millennium Declaration, General Assembly Resolution 55/2 (2000). </p>
<p>The U.N. says that "The commitment to provide 0.7% of gross national product (GNP) as official development assistance was first made 35 years ago in a General Assembly resolution, but it has been reaffirmed repeatedly over the years, including at the 2002 global Financing for Development conference in Monterrey, Mexico. However, in 2004, total aid from the industrialized countries totaled just $78.6 billion-or about 0.25% of their collective GNP." </p>
<p>In addition to seeking to eradicate poverty, that declaration commits nations to banning "small arms and light weapons" and ratifying a series of treaties, including the International Criminal Court Treaty, the Kyoto Protocol (global warming treaty), the Convention on Biological Diversity, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, and the Convention on the Rights of the Child. </p>
<p>The Millennium Declaration also affirms the U.N. as "the indispensable common house of the entire human family, through which we will seek to realize our universal aspirations for peace, cooperation and development." </p>
<p>Jeffrey Sachs, who runs the U.N.'s "Millennium Project," says that the U.N. plan to force the U.S. to pay 0.7 percent of GNP in increased foreign aid spending would add $65 billion a year to what the U.S. already spends. Over a 13-year period, from 2002, when the U.N.'s Financing for Development conference was held, to the target year of 2015, when the U.S. is expected to meet the "Millennium Development Goals," this amounts to $845 billion. And the only way to raise that kind of money, Sachs has written, is through a global tax, preferably on carbon-emitting fossil fuels. </p>
<p>Obama's bill has only six co-sponsors. They are Senators Maria Cantwell, Dianne Feinstein, Richard Lugar, Richard Durbin, Chuck Hagel and Robert Menendez. But it appears that Biden and Obama see passage of this bill as a way to highlight Democratic Party priorities in the Senate. </p>
<p>The House version (H.R. 1302), sponsored by Rep. Adam Smith (D-Wash.), had only 84 co-sponsors before it was suddenly brought up on the House floor last September 25 and was passed by voice vote. House Republicans were caught off-guard, unaware that the pro-U.N. measure committed the U.S. to spending hundreds of billions of dollars. </p>
<p>It appears the Senate version is being pushed not only by Biden and Obama, a member of the committee, but Lugar, the ranking Republican member. Lugar has worked with Obama in the past to promote more foreign aid for Russia, supposedly to stem nuclear proliferation, and has become Obama's mentor. Like Biden, Lugar is a globalist. They have both promoted passage of the U.N.'s Law of the Sea Treaty, for example.</p>
<p>The so-called "Lugar-Obama initiative" was modeled after the Nunn-Lugar program, also known as the Cooperative Threat Reduction (CTR) program, which was designed to eliminate weapons of mass destruction in the former Soviet Union. But one defense analyst, Rich Kelly, noted evidence that "CTR funds have eased the Russian military's budgetary woes, freeing resources for such initiatives as the war in Chechnya and defense modernization." He recommended that Congress "eliminate CTR funding so that it does not finance additional, perhaps more threatening, programs in the former Soviet Union." However, over $6 billion has already been spent on the program. </p>
<p>Another program modeled on Nunn-Lugar, the Initiatives for Proliferation Prevention (IPP), was recently exposed as having funded nuclear projects in Iran through Russia. </p>
<p>More foreign aid through passage of the Global Poverty Act was identified as one of the strategic goals of InterAction, the alliance of U.S-based international non-governmental organizations that lobbies for more foreign aid. The group is heavily financed by the U.S. Government, having received $1.4 million from taxpayers in fiscal year 2005 and $1.7 million in 2006. However, InterAction recently issued a report accusing the United States of "falling short on its commitment to rid the world of dire poverty by 2015 under the U.N. Millennium Development Goals..." </p>
<p>It's not clear what President Bush would do if the bill passes the Senate. The bill itself quotes Bush as declaring that "We fight against poverty because opportunity is a fundamental right to human dignity." Bush's former top aide, Michael J. Gerson, writes in his new book, Heroic Conservatism, that Bush should be remembered as the President who "sponsored the largest percentage increases in foreign assistance since the Marshall Plan..."</p>
<p>Even these increases, however, will not be enough to satisfy the requirements of the Obama bill. A global tax will clearly be necessary to force American taxpayers to provide the money. <br/>

<p>It looks McCain is determined to play bad guy this time.</p>
<p>But it is good thing for Americans to know the root cause of this once life-time finance crisis although at the expense of credits of government and congress.</p>
<p>Once again McCain proves his standing for America rather than parties.</p>
<p>Americans need the true now more than ever so they can make the right chioce.</p>

<p>"<br/>
There are certainly plenty of places to point fingers, and it may be hard to pinpoint the original event that set it all in motion. But let me give you an educated guess. The financial crisis we're living through today started with the corruption and manipulation of our home mortgage system. At the center of the problem were the lobbyists, politicians, and bureaucrats who succeeded in persuading Congress and the administration to ignore the festering problems at Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. </p>
<p>These quasi-public corporations lead our housing system down a path where quick profit was placed before sound finance. They institutionalized a system that rewarded forcing mortgages on people who couldn't afford them, while turning around and selling those bad mortgages to the banks that are now going bankrupt. Using money and influence, they prevented reforms that would have curbed their power and limited their ability to damage our economy. And now, as ever, the American taxpayers are left to pay the price for Washington's failure. <br/>

<p>Sorry, but the WORLD and all the people whom Barack shared free Brats/Beer and concerts with, aren't Americans and WON'T be electing our next President.</p>
<p>B.O. is a master Promiser and Panderer... this type of behavior is going to bite him, sooner or later. Better to not have it happen in the Oval Office.</p>
<p>Barack Obama = Rezko/Wright/Ayers/Kilpatrick/???</p>
<p>Ripping off the poor, dam*ing America, creating Anarchy, endorsing (alleged) murderous crooks, and who knows what else?</p>
<p>B.O. has a character problem, and it will prevent him from becoming President.</p>
<p>John McCain on the other hand has a proven LIFETIME of service to America.</p>
<p>Go McCain / Palin 2008!<br/>
Hillary 2012!! Bring it!</p>

<p>McCain calling out Obama for questionable advisers and lacking knowledge on the economy...</p>
<p>That's rich.</p>
<p>McCain has flip-flopped and contradicted himself so many times, at this point there's a sound-bite to support or deny any angle of any subject. </p>
<p>Except: McCain, why doesn't your running mate think the law applies to her? Should we expect more of this from your administration?</p>

<p>One thing that the McCain doesn't get, as they follow the Bush strategy of 'lie, without remorse,' is that, eventually, their credibility will be irreversibly destroyed.</p>
<p>Add this to another in a long line of McCain lies.</p>
<p>They are lies that McCain runs on, because he is too ashamed to admit that he is a Republican and has been the most fervent supporter of Bush for the past 8 years.</p>
<p>CNN had a good feature recently on the lies of McCain-Palin.</p>
<p>If you missed it, I have the clip.</p>

<p>Obama very well understands this little piece of Orwellian logic by denying past associations with Raines that are well documented. Next, He will deny that Jim Johnson -- another Fannie Mae fraudster -- ever worked for His campaign.</p>

<p>Vote for Obama and you will EFFECTIVELY END Hillary's chance at EVER becoming President!!</p>
<p>Obama has already destroyed Hillary's chances for this time around. He couldn't even do her the honor of making her VP. Don't let him end her Presidential prospects forever.</p>
<p>Consider this:<br/>
If you elect Obama for 2008 , Hillary CAN'T RUN IN 2012!! The incumbent always runs for their party in reelection. This means Barack Obama, if President, will automatically be the Democratic nominee in 2012.</p>
<p>Hillary would then be 69 YRS OLD when she would get her next chance to run as President in 2016. Then people would simply call her too old(like they do McCain who is 72) and she would NEVER get a chance to become President.</p>
<p>Reagan was 69 when he got elected BUT he wasn't trying to break the glass ceiling at the same time.</p>
<p>So if you care at all about Hillary, you will VOTE AGAINST Obama this time around. Plus, you will break the glass ceiling and Hillary WILL<br/>
BE THERE in 2012!!</p>
<p>Think about it!! It makes sense!!</p>
<p>If you support Hillary, YOU MUST VOTE AGAINST OBAMA!!!</p>

<p>John McCain is a sell-out and exposed he is just a typical Republican politician by picking Palin. He picked her to appease his base, poach Hillary votes and stoke a culture divide. Even Britain and Europe know Obama is the better candidate.</p>
<p>The only people who don’t get it are the brainwashed right-wing puppets who think that just because someone has a speech draw and likes to fish that somehow makes politicians just like them or the best candidate to run the government. I like Tina Fey too, that doesn’t mean she should run the country. Are we really this foolish? Palin wasn’t the best or most qualified, it’s because mcCain knew she would be a draw to small town America whom they are duping (Sara Palin ain’t like you, folks). </p>
<p>How is this being a "maverick"? How is it ‘Country First”? How is this “I rather win a war than loose an election”? I’ll say it again, John McCain is a sell-out. Obama said it pretty accurately too - Lipstick on a pig, is still a pig.</p>
<p>The most important metric for picking a VP is they are ready to step in from day one. His judgment is reckless and he gambled at our expense. The mere fact Palin is being educated on foreign policy and is avoiding the press indicates she wasn’t prepared on day one. She is running for the second highest office, but can’t answer questions from the press or public? This doesn’t alarm anyone?</p>
<p>I lost all my respect for John McCain. He's not the hero today he was 35 years ago. McCain is nothing without Palin and he'll say anything to get elected.</p>
<p>What does it say about a campaign that has to "mimic" what and whom Obama is, not to mention hijack Obamas core message of Change from day one just to poach votes? Is that all they view Obama as, a "product" a "formula", a “personality”? It makes McCain look weak and more importantly, the American people stupid if they fall for it.</p>
<p>Now all these puppets are willing to just get behind her without even knowing anything about her and try to convince the American public she is prepared to be VP or President? Not even uncertain objectiveness, caution, pause or question just because she has an "R" in front of her name? How can anyone make a honest, clear determination reasonably in less than 50 days.</p>
<p>Bravo America! We look like complete idiots once again while the world watches. I am truly embarrassed of my country. I guess all isn’t lost, at least many will have Palin’s eye glass frames while our country crumbles economically. We are such tools.</p>
<p>If Palin/McCain win I'm leaving this country. I’m not paying for a war that should have never happened or failed Bush policies any more than I already have.</p>

<p>McCain is NOT Bush! Does he vote republican? Yes, but less than the average Republican.. Enough to cause a tie-breaker on some bills. He's different on taxes and the environment mostly.</p>
<p>Barack says McCain votes for Bush policy 90% of the time(a nonsensical conjecture for marketing), but using the same broken calculation, Barack himself then votes for his own party 97% of the time. Who is more of the same? This is a bad comparison anyways.</p>

<p>Politco reported on July 16th that Raines had stated he was advising Obama on mortgage and housing issues.</p>
<p>Then we have James Johnson, another former CEO of Fannie, being placed in-charge of Obama's search for a vice presidential candidate.</p>
<p>Also it is not disputed that Obama has received the second largest amounts in campaign contributions from individuals connected with Fannie and Freddie and that was only in four years.</p>
<p>It took Senator Chris Dodd (D-Conn) twenty years to be the largest beneficiary of campaign contributions from Fannie and Freddie.</p>
<p>I would have to say that Senator Obama needs to explain his relationship with these firms.</p>
