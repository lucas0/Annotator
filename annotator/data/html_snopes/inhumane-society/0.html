<p>"To confine impeachable conduct to indictable offenses may well be to 
        set a standard so restrictive as not to reach conduct that might adversely 
        affect the system of government. Some of the most grevious offenses against 
        our constitutional form of government may not entail violations of the 
        criminal law.....Io limit impeachable conduct to criminal offenses would 
        be incompatible with the evidence...and would frustrate the purpose that 
        the framers intended.... Impeachment was evolved.....to cope with both 
        the inadequacy of the criminal standards and the impotence of the courts 
        to deal with the conduct of great public figures. It would be anomalous 
        if the framers, having barred criminal sanctions from the impeachment 
        remedy....intended to restrict the grounds for impeachment to conduct 
        that was criminal" Hillary Rodham Staff Attorney House Judiciary Committee
