<h3><a name="intro"></a>I. Introduction</h3>
<p>The purpose of this document is to further present the background
and rationale for FDA's recommended maximum lead level in candy likely to be
  consumed frequently by small children. The 0.1 parts per million (ppm) recommended
maximum lead level in candy described herein is included as a part of the 2005
updated FDA guidance on lead in candy entitled  "<a href="pbguid2.html">Lead
in Candy Likely To Be Frequently Consumed by Small Children: Recommended Maximum
Level and Enforcement Policy, </a>". FDA considers the recommended maximum lead
level to be achievable and to be protective of public heath.</p>
<h3><a name="over"></a>II. Overview of FDA Activities Addressing Lead in
Food</h3>
<p>Lead is a naturally occurring element whose toxicity in
humans has been documented throughout history.</p>
<p>Lead is widely present in our environment due to its natural
occurrence and human activities that have introduced it into the general
environment such as the use of leaded gasoline.  Because lead may be present in
environments where food crops are grown and animals used for food are raised,
various foods may contain unavoidable but small amounts of lead that do not
pose a significant risk to human health.  </p>
<p>However, foods may become contaminated with lead if they are
grown, stored or processed under conditions that could introduce larger amounts
of lead into the food, such as when a root crop is grown in soil that has been
contaminated from the past use of leaded pesticides on that acreage.  Under
such conditions, the resulting contamination of the food may pose a health risk
to consumers.</p>
<p>FDA first recognized the need to control potential lead
exposure from food in the 1930s.  The earliest actions of the agency focused on
limiting the potential for lead to become a component of food as a consequence
of intentional uses of lead containing substances in agriculture and food
processing, e.g., lead-based pesticides and lead containing solder in food
cans. (Ref. 1)</p>
<p>During the 1970s and 1980s studies were published
documenting adverse effects of lead in children at lower blood lead levels than
had been previously established.  In 1979, FDA stated that it intended to
expand its programs to monitor and reduce lead levels in the food supply with
the objective of reducing consumer's lead exposure to the lowest level that can
be practicably obtained. (Ref. 2)  </p>
<p>The goal of limiting lead contamination of food was
facilitated by the development and implementation of the use of welded
(non-soldered) food cans during the 1980s.  This development and the concurrent
prohibition of the use of lead containing gasoline in the U.S. are largely
responsible for dramatic decreases in measured lead levels in the U.S. diet
beginning in the 1980s. (Ref. 3)</p>
<p>FDA's past and current activities intended to reduce or
limit lead levels in food have addressed pesticides, lead glazed ceramic ware
and other house wares, bottled water, wine, food cans, food additives, candy
and candy wrappers.</p>
<h3><a name="pbcan"></a>III. FDA Actions Addressing Lead in Candy and Candy Wrappers</h3>
<p>Candy products were not known to be a significant food
source of lead until 1994, when California authorities found that an imported
candy product from Mexico was contaminated with lead that had migrated into the
candy from lead-based ink used in the candy's packaging.  The package was
poorly designed such that its inner coating did not maintain its structural
integrity, allowing lead-based ink in the outer package layer to migrate into
the candy.</p>
<p>Subsequently, FDA began testing other candy products with
lead-based printing inks on their packaging to determine whether lead from the
ink was migrating into the candy.  In its testing, FDA discovered that, apart
from any consideration of the wrapper as source of the lead, some imported
candy products from Mexico contained higher lead levels than were typically
found in domestic candy products.  As discussed below, FDA determined that the
higher lead levels were largely associated with certain ingredients used in
these imported candy products.  </p>
<p>Prompted
by these findings, in 1995 FDA issued a letter entitled "<a href="/web/20090117100949/http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~dms/pbguid.html">Letter
to Manufacturers, Importers, and Distributors of Imported Candy and Candy
Wrappers</a>," (the 1995 letter)
addressing its concerns about lead in candy derived from both candy wrappers
and candy ingredients. </p>
<p>Concerning lead in candy
derived from sources other than the wrapper, e.g., lead from candy ingredients,
FDA advised manufacturers, importers, and distributors of imported candy, that
where frequent consumption of candy products by small children could be
anticipated, the agency would consider taking regulatory action against candy
with lead levels that exceeded 0.5 parts per million (ppm). The 0.5 ppm
guideline was, at that time, equivalent to the Food Chemicals Codex (FCC)
specification for lead in sucrose (sugar), the main ingredient in many candy
products.<sup><a href="pbcandy.html#ftn1" name="ftnref1">[1]</a></sup>
</p><p>Many candy products contain sugar or chocolate as principal
ingredients.  Sugar (sucrose) is made by a process, i.e., re-crystallization,
which when carried out under good manufacturing practices, typically results in
low parts per billion (ppb) (1 ppb is equivalent to 0.001 ppm) or undetectable
lead levels in the final product.  Consequently, FDA typically finds low parts
per billion or undetectable levels of lead in sugar-based candies it analyzes
in its monitoring activities.  While the manufacture of chocolate does not
involve a re-crystallization process, most finished milk chocolate products
contain lead levels well below 0.1 ppm. </p>
<p>Many Mexican-style<sup><a href="pbcandy.html#ftn2" name="ftnref2">[2]</a></sup>
candy products can contain significant amounts of chili powder (hereafter,
chili).  At the time we issued the 1995 letter, we were aware that candy
products with ingredients, such as chili, may contain more lead than
sugar-based candies because chili is a minimally refined ingredient which would
not be expected to contain lead levels as low as those in highly refined ingredients
like sugar.  </p>
<p>Since the issuance of the 1995 letter, however, we have
found several candy and related products, i.e., "powdered snack mix" products
(described below) containing chili to be contaminated with levels of lead that
suggest that good manufacturing practices are not being employed in the
manufacture of the chili ingredient, resulting in significant contamination of
the chili ingredient and finished candy products with lead.</p>
<p>These findings of
elevated levels of lead in candy and powdered snack mix products and our belief
that such lead contamination is avoidable led FDA to issue a
 <a href="/web/20090117100949/http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~dms/pbltr.html">letter to the industry</a> on March 25, 2004
(the 2004 letter)
in which FDA announced that it intended to lower the 0.5 ppm guideline for
considering enforcement action against candy products containing lead and
likely to be consumed frequently by small children.  </p>
<p>Concurrent with this
document, FDA has issued a draft guidance document entitled
"<a href="pbguid2.html">Lead in Candy Likely To Be Consumed
Frequently by Small Children: Recommended Maximum Level and
Enforcement Policy</a>."
 This draft guidance document announces a recommended maximum level for lead in candy
likely to be consumed frequently by small children of 0.1 ppm.  The draft
guidance also rescinds the .5 ppm guideline for considering enforcement action and
does not announce a new enforcement guideline.    </p>
<h3><a name="lead"></a>IV. Lead Levels Found in Candy</h3>
<h4>a. Sugar-Based Candy</h4>
<p>As noted above, FDA typically finds undetectable or low
parts per billion levels of lead in most sugar-based candies it analyzes.  For
example, during the period late-1991 through 2002, FDA collected and analyzed
40 samples of suckers (lollipops of various flavors) as components of market
baskets in its Total Diet Study (TDS) program.<sup><a href="pbcandy.html#ftn3" name="ftnref3">[3]</a></sup>
Of the 40 sucker samples analyzed, FDA did not detect lead in 33 samples, and
detected lead at levels too low to reliably quantify (referred to as a "trace"
levels) in 7 samples.  Based on all 40 results, the mean (average) estimated
lead level was 4 ppb, with a standard deviation of 9 ppb and a maximum
estimated trace value of 38 ppb.  For granulated white sugar samples collected
in the TDS during the same period, FDA did not detect lead in 39 of 40 samples
it analyzed, and found a trace level of 18 ppb in the remaining sample.  These
results are what we would expect to find in sugar and sugar-based foods,
consistent with the current FCC specification for lead in sucrose (sugar) of
0.1 ppm (100 ppb) because food ingredients typically are manufactured to
contain average levels of contaminants that are well below the applicable limit
to ensure that lots of the ingredient containing lead at the high end of the
production range will still be below the applicable limit.  Accordingly, FDA
believes that sugar-based candy products can be made with lead levels below 0.1
ppm.</p>
<h4>b. Chocolate Candy</h4>
<p>FDA's TDS data on milk chocolate candy during the period
mid-1991 through 2002 indicate that the mean lead level in 40 samples of milk
chocolate candy bars was 0.025 ppm, the standard deviation was 0.018 ppm, and
the maximum lead level found was 0.110 ppm.  Data provided to FDA by the
chocolate industry in 2005 (Ref. 4) indicate that the mean lead level in 137
milk chocolate samples (consisting of 7 products) was 0.028 ppm, the standard
deviation was 0.022 ppm, and the maximum lead level found was 0.222 ppm. The
industry data showed one additional sample with a lead level slightly greater
than 0.1 ppm; all other lead levels in products tested were below 0.1 ppm.  </p>
<p>The chocolate industry data indicate that the mean lead
level in 226 dark chocolate samples (consisting of 9 products) was 0.048 ppm,
the standard deviation was 0.029 ppm, and the maximum lead level found was
0.275 ppm.  Several dark chocolate samples had lead levels exceeding 0.1 ppm,
and more dark chocolate than milk chocolate samples had lead levels approaching
0.1 ppm.  Dark chocolate samples tended to have higher lead levels than milk
chocolate samples because  chocolate liquor is the principal source of lead in
chocolate products, and dark chocolate products contain higher amounts of
chocolate liquor than milk chocolate products. </p>
<p>We believe that if milk
chocolate manufacturers source their raw materials appropriately, lead levels
in their finished products will not exceed 0.1 ppm lead.  With respect to dark
chocolate, we expect lead levels to be higher than lead levels in milk
chocolate due to the higher chocolate liquor content of dark chocolate.
However, we believe that the consumption of dark chocolate products by children
is limited.  Results of the United States Department of Agriculture's
(USDA's) 1994-96, 1998 Continuing Survey of Food Intakes by Individuals (CFSII)
indicate that less than 1% of the children under age 6 surveyed consumed dark
chocolate.  We believe that, if dark chocolate
manufacturers source their raw materials appropriately, lead levels in their
finished products will not exceed 0.1 ppm.  </p>
<h4>c. Mexican-Style Candy<sup><a href="pbcandy.html#ftn4" name="ftnref4">[4]</a></sup></h4>
<ol class="lo-rom">
<li>With Chili as an Ingredient
 
 
 
<p>As noted above, we have found elevated levels of lead in Mexican-style
candy products that contain chili.  For example, from October 2000 to February
2004, we analyzed 132 candy products from Mexico, including powdered snack mix
products for lead as part of our imported foods monitoring activity (Ref. 5).
Fifty-two of these products had no detectable lead, while 51 had detectable
levels of lead that did not exceed 0.150 ppm.  Eleven products had lead levels
in the 0.151-0.250 ppm range while eighteen had lead levels greater than 0.250 ppm.
Among the latter group, 10 of the 18 products contained chili, and based upon
visual observation, we believe that some contained significant amounts of
chili.<sup><a href="pbcandy.html#ftn5" name="ftnref5">[5]</a></sup>
</p>
<p>When monitoring for lead levels in its TDS, FDA typically
finds that fresh peppers contain lead at non-detectable levels or trace
levels.  During the mid-1991 through 2002 period, FDA analyzed 40 samples of
raw green peppers in its TDS and did not detect lead in 37 samples, while it
detected trace levels of lead in 3 samples with a maximum estimated level of 14
ppb.  Although FDA currently has only limited data on chili peppers, because
chili peppers are similar in physical characteristics to green peppers, we believe
that freshly grown raw chili peppers are not likely to be inherently contaminated
with lead.  Industry has, however, reported to FDA that chili can become
contaminated with lead when soil deposits (which contain some level of lead)
that accumulate on peppers from their growing and handling in open fields, are
not removed by a washing step prior to grinding the dried peppers into chili
powder.  (Ref. 6).  The lead introduced by the deposited soil is further
concentrated by the drying of the peppers.<sup><a href="pbcandy.html#ftn6" name="ftnref6">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>Information reported to
FDA by the industry indicates a broad range of lead levels in finished chili
available in Mexico, and that higher levels of lead are present in chili from
unwashed peppers (Ref. 6).  Chili made from washed peppers averaged 0.241 ppm
lead (range 0.023 to 1.14 ppm) while chili made from unwashed chili peppers
averaged 0.938 ppm lead (range 0.049 to 2.21 ppm).  These data suggest that Mexican-style candy manufacturers could significantly
reduce lead levels in their candy products by ensuring that their chili
ingredients are sourced from suppliers that effectively wash the peppers before
they are ground.  </p>
<p>If the lead range data
for the chili from washed peppers is adjusted for a 6-fold concentration
effect, the corresponding lead levels in chili peppers would average about 40
ppb with a range of 4 to 190 ppb.  Because TDS data on lead levels in raw green
peppers indicate that lead is typically not detected on the peppers, we believe
that the industry data on lead levels in chili suggest that substantial
contamination of the peppers may be occurring at some point prior to the
grinding operation, e.g., perhaps during open field drying, if the pepper is
placed on the ground to dry.  In addition to a washing operation prior to
grinding, actions to control soil contamination of chili peppers during all
stages of product's life, e.g., not placing the pepper in contact with the
ground during "off the plant" drying, could also minimize lead levels in
Mexican-style candy products.</p>
<p>We believe that Mexican-style
candy manufacturers could obtain chili with 0.2 ppm or less lead content by
sourcing chili made from effectively washed chili peppers, which were handled,
e.g., dried, under good agricultural practices.  Consequently, even for high-chili-content
candy and powdered snack mix products, we believe that candy with appropriately
sourced ingredients will not exceed 0.1 ppm lead.<sup><a href="pbcandy.html#ftn7" name="ftnref7">[7]</a></sup></p></li>
<li>Salt-BasedPowdered Snack Products
 
<p>Included
in the 7 Mexican-style candy products tested by FDA that contained over 0.5 ppm
lead were 3 powdered snack mix products that did not contain chili, but
contained salt as their primary ingredient.  Industry has reported to FDA that
Mexican salt-based snack products can contain more than 50% salt (Ref. 6), and
FDA has encountered powdered snack mix products consisting of only salt, citric
acid and flavoring (the latter two ingredients are refined ingredients that are
not likely to contain significant amounts of lead).  The finding of elevated
levels of lead in such products suggests that salt is a source of lead
contamination in some imported powdered snack mix products.  Since salt available
for use as a food ingredient in Mexico is reported to contain lead ranges of 0.01-0.08 ppm for
marine salt and 0.1-1.5 ppm for mined salt (Ref. 6) we believe that salt at the
high end of the range for mined salt was used in formulating some powdered
snack mix products resulting in the food containing avoidable lead
contamination.  We believe that if manufacturers source salt to minimize lead
levels, finished, high-salt- content powdered snack mix products will not
exceed 0.1 ppm lead.</p></li>
<li>Tamarind Pulp
 
<p>Tamarind
pulp is a popular ingredient in many Mexican-style candy products.  Industry
information submitted to FDA states that tamarind pulp may be present at levels
not exceeding 5% in sugar-based Mexican candies. (Ref. 6)  Although FDA has
encountered some tamarind candy products packed in poorly made lead glazed
bowls from which very high levels of lead leached into the candy, <sup><a href="pbcandy.html#ftn8" name="ftnref8">[8]</a></sup> the industry information for 22
samples of tamarind pulp from Mexico showed an average lead concentration of 0.014 ppm, with a
standard deviation of 0.005 ppm, and a range of 0.006 to 0.028 ppm.  These data
suggest that tamarind as an ingredient can be produced under good manufacturing
practices such that it is not likely to be a significant source of elevated
lead levels in Mexican-style candies.  </p></li>
</ol>
<h4>d. Other Candy Ingredients and Other Types of Candy</h4>
<p>FDA reviewed data on lead
levels in other common candy ingredients and other types of candy.  For
example, peanuts are a common candy ingredient.  During the period
mid-1991 through 2002, FDA collected and analyzed 40 samples of dry roasted
peanuts as components of market baskets in its TDS.  FDA did not detect lead in
39 of the 40 samples.  FDA detected a trace amount of lead, estimated at 17
ppb, in the remaining sample.  </p>
<p>Other types of nuts are used as candy ingredients.
For mixed nuts collected in the TDS during the period mid-1991 through 2002,
FDA did not detect lead in 33 of 40 samples it analyzed.  FDA detected trace
levels of lead in 6 of the 40 samples with a mean lead level of 4 ppb, and detected
90 ppb lead in the remaining sample.</p>
<p>Raisins are used as candy ingredients.  During the
period mid-1991 through 2002, FDA collected and analyzed 40 samples of raisins
as components of market baskets in its TDS.  FDA did not detect lead in 20 of
the 40 raisin samples.  The other 20 samples contained  trace levels, with a
mean lead level of 9 ppb, and a maximum estimated value of 31 ppb.  </p>
<p>FDA also considered data for caramel candy, a candy
typically made from sugar, butter, cream, and sometimes other ingredients such
as syrup and flour.  During the period mid-1991 through 2002, FDA collected and
analyzed 40 samples of caramel candy as components of market baskets in its
TDS.  FDA did not detect lead in 36 of the 40 caramel candy samples.  FDA
detected trace levels of lead in the other 4 samples, with a mean lead level of
2 ppb, and a maximum value of 30 ppb.  </p>
<p>Having considered data on
common candy ingredients and other types of candy (besides sugar-based,
chocolate and Mexican-style candy) FDA is not aware of any reason, e.g.,
ingredient considerations, why other types of candy cannot achieve lead levels
of 0.1 ppm or less as we similarly found for sugar-based, chocolate and
Mexican-style candies.  Accordingly FDA believes that other types of candy
besides sugar-based, chocolate and Mexican-style candies can also achieve lead
levels of 0.1 ppm or less.  </p>
<h3><a name="healt"></a>V. Health Protection Considerations</h3>
<p>FDA has estimated the potential exposure of small
children from the candy products with lead levels no higher than we anticipate to
be present in candy produced when we issue the 0.1 ppm guidance level and has concluded
that the lead in such candy products would not constitute a health hazard.  </p>
<p> We used a modeling technique known as Monte Carlo
simulation to estimate the mean and 90<sup>th</sup> percentile daily intake of
lead per small child that would likely result if manufactures produced candy
with these anticipated lead levels.<sup><a href="pbcandy.html#ftn9" name="ftnref9">[9]</a></sup>
We then compared these lead intake levels to FDA's provisional total tolerable
intake level (PTTIL) for lead by small children of 6 micrograms per day. (Ref.
1)  The simulations incorporated data on lead concentration data from FDA's TDS
and from industry, and food consumption data from the 1994-98 CSFII.</p>
<p>The PTTIL is the total daily lead intake from all
sources that provides a reasonable margin of protection against the known
adverse effects of lead.  An estimate of lead intake from a respective type of
candy that is low relative to the PTTIL indicates that the candy would not pose
a significant risk for adverse health effects from lead exposure.</p>
<h4>a. Sugar-Based Candy</h4>
<p>For worst case lead levels we would anticipate to
occur in sugar-based candy, FDA used the lead distribution data for suckers
from the mid-1991 through 2002 TDS.  As noted above, the lead distribution data
for the 40 samples of suckers had a mean of 4 ppb and a standard deviation of 9
ppb.  For consumption of sugar-based candy, FDA based its estimate on the most
relevant food codes reported in the 1994-96, 1998 CSFII, i.e., hard candy and
butterscotch candy.  </p>
<p>The mean and 90<sup>th</sup> percentile lead intake
estimates for sugar-based candy using these inputs were 0.04 and 0.09
micrograms per day for males and females 1-3 years of age, and 0.04 and 0.08
micrograms per day for males and females 4-6 years of age, respectively. (Ref. 7)
These lead intake estimates likely represent a worst case scenario because some
of the lead data for suckers was obtained during a time period when the FCC
specification for lead in sugar was higher than the current value, i.e., 0.5 ppm
rather than 0.1 ppm.  Because of the lower current specification for lead in
sugar, FDA believes that it is possible that the current lead distribution for
sugar-based candy may have shifted to lower levels than those used to generate
this simulation.  Nonetheless, as these lead intake estimates are well below
the PTTIL of 6 micrograms per day, FDA believes that sugar-based candies would
not pose a significant risk to small children for adverse health effects from
lead exposure if sugar-based candies contain the lead levels we would anticipate
when we issue the 0.1 ppm guidance level for lead in candy.</p>
<h4>b. Chocolate Candy and Other Non-Mexican-Style Candy</h4>
<p>For milk chocolate, FDA performed two lead intake
calculations using a Monte Carlo simulation. (Ref. 7)  One calculation used the
lead distribution data for milk chocolate from the 1991-2002 results from the
TDS and the other calculation used lead distribution data submitted by the
industry.  As noted above, the lead distribution data for the 40 TDS samples of
milk chocolate had a mean of 25 ppb and a standard deviation of 18 ppb, while
the lead distribution data for the 137 industry samples of milk chocolate had a
mean of 28 ppb and a standard deviation of 22 ppb.  For both milk chocolate
calculations FDA used consumption data for milk chocolate from the 1994-96,
1998 CFSII. </p>
<p>The mean and 90<sup>th</sup> percentile lead intake
estimates for milk chocolate using these inputs were 0.25 and 0.52 micrograms
per day for males and females 1-3 years of age, respectively, using the TDS
data, and 0.29 and 0.60 micrograms per day for males and females 1-3 years of
age, respectively, using the industry data.  For males and females 4-6 years of
age, the mean and 90<sup>th</sup> percentile lead intake estimates for milk
chocolate using these inputs were 0.34 and 0.72 micrograms per day, and 0.38
and 0.82 micrograms per day using the TDS and industry data, respectively.  </p>
<p>The lead intake estimates calculated using the TDS
and the industry data are consistent, and are well below the PTTIL of 6
micrograms per day.  These estimates are based upon data that showed a small
portion of milk chocolate samples with lead levels greater than 0.1 ppm.  As
noted above, FDA believes that, if milk chocolate manufacturers source their
raw materials appropriately (which we anticipate will happen when we issue the
0.1 ppm guidance level for lead in candy), their finished products will contain
less than 0.1 ppm lead.  This would result in slightly lower lead intake levels
from milk chocolate than those we estimated.  Thus, FDA believes that milk
chocolate would not pose a significant risk to small children for adverse
health effects from lead exposure if milk chocolate contains the lead levels we
would anticipate when we issue the 0.1 ppm guidance level for lead in candy. </p>
<p>For the intake simulation for dark chocolate (Ref.
7), FDA used the lead distribution data for dark chocolate submitted by the
industry.  As noted above, the lead distribution data for the 226 industry
samples of dark chocolate had a mean of 48 ppb and a standard deviation of 29
ppb.  For the dark chocolate lead intake calculation, FDA used consumption data
for dark chocolate from the 1994-96, 1998 CFSII. </p>
<p>The mean and 90<sup>th</sup> percentile lead intake
estimates for dark chocolate using these inputs were 0.40 and 0.80 micrograms
per day for males and females 1-3 years of age.  For males and females 4-6
years of age the mean and 90<sup>th</sup> percentile lead intake estimates for
dark chocolate using these inputs were 0.44 and 0.91 micrograms per day.  These
lead intake estimates are well below the PTTIL of 6 micrograms per day.  These
estimates are based upon data that showed some dark chocolate samples with lead
levels approaching and above 0.1 ppm.  FDA anticipates that any dark chocolate
manufacturers who market products likely to be consumed frequently by small children
will source their raw materials accordingly and that lead intake levels for
children who consume such products would be somewhat lower than those we
estimated.  FDA believes that dark chocolate products would not pose a
significant risk to small children for adverse health effects from lead
exposure if the dark chocolate contains the lead levels we would anticipate
when we issue the 0.1 ppm guidance level for lead in candy.</p>
<p>FDA believes that lead intakes from other types of
candy, excluding Mexican-style candy and powdered snack mix products, would
likely be within the range of lead intakes bounded by sugar-based and milk
chocolate candies, because common candy ingredients, e.g., peanuts, nuts, and raisins,
do not appear to pose the potential to introduce lead into candy products at
levels exceeding those in sugar-based and chocolate candy.</p>
<h4>c. Mexican-Style Candy and Powdered Snack Mixes</h4>
<ol class="lo-rom">
<li>With Chili as an Ingredient
 
<p>Both hard sugar-based candies
included in the intake estimate above, and soft sugar-based candies containing
tamarind pulp are typical of Mexican-style candies that contain chili.  For
estimating lead intake from these candies, FDA assumed that chili would be
present at 15% by weight in both sugar based soft and hard candies, that all
the lead in the candy would be contributed by the chili ingredient, that in
response to the new guidance Mexican candy manufacturers would source washed chili
for their products intended for export to the U.S., and that the chili
ingredient contained lead at the levels reported to us for washed chili by the
industry, i.e., an average of 0.241 ppm lead (range
0.023 to 1.14 ppm) with a standard deviation of 0.173 ppm.  FDA performed a
lead intake calculation using a Monte Carlo simulation incorporating these
assumptions regarding the chili content of soft and hard candies, and the lead
content of chili, using consumption data from the 1994-96, 1998 CFSII for hard
candy and for selected soft sugar-based candies (i.e., gum drops and soft fruit
candy) that were considered to be suitable surrogates for Mexican-style
candies. (Ref. 7)</p>
<p>The mean and 90<sup>th</sup> percentile lead intake
estimates for Mexican-style candy using these inputs were 0.54 and 1.20
micrograms per day for males and females 1-3 years of age, and 0.60 and 1.31
micrograms per day for males and females 4-6 years of age, respectively.  As
these lead intake estimates are well below the PTTIL of 6 micrograms per day,
FDA believes that Mexican-style candy would not pose a significant risk for
adverse health effects from lead exposure if it contains the lead levels we
would anticipate when we issue the 0.1 ppm guidance level for lead in candy. </p> </li>
<li>Salt-Based Powdered Snack Products
 
<p>For powdered snack mix products,
because the CFSII does not include any foods that are suitable surrogates for
powdered snack mix products, FDA estimated lead intake for such products
containing sugar, e.g., salt, sugar and chili, and such products not containing
sugar, e.g., salt and flavoring or salt and chili, using consumption
information for powdered snack mix products obtained from a short-term survey
(Ref. 8).  We performed a Monte Carlo simulation using the serving size and
frequency information from the survey (Ref. 9) and assumed that the worst case
lead content of the products would be 0.08 ppm.  This level, 0.08 ppm, is the
upper end of the reported lead range for marine salt in Mexico (Ref. 6), and
salt is the principal ingredient in powdered snack mix products.  FDA
recognizes that chili can be present at levels up to 30% in powdered snack mix
products, and can also be a source of lead in these products.  However, FDA
believes that manufacturers who use chili in their products are likely to
source chili containing less than the average reported lead level for washed
chili and are also likely to source salt at the lower end of the reported lead
range for marine salt.  Therefore, the 0.08 ppm assumption is reasonable for
firms that minimize the lead content of their ingredients. </p>
<p>We estimated for children 2-5 years of age, a 90<sup>th</sup>
percentile lead intake for sugar containing powdered snack mix products of
about 2.3 micrograms per day, and a 90<sup>th</sup> percentile lead intake for
non-sugar containing powdered snack mix products of about 0.9 micrograms per
day.  As these lead intake estimates are well below the PTTIL of 6 micrograms
per day, FDA believes that Mexican powdered snack mix products would not pose a
significant risk for adverse health effects to small children from lead
exposure if they contain the lead levels we would anticipate when we issue the
0.1 ppm guidance level for lead in candy.</p></li>
<li>
With Tamarind as an Ingredient
 
<p>As noted above, based upon low
concentrations of lead found in tamarind pulp samples, FDA believes that tamarind is not likely to be a significant source of
elevated lead levels in Mexican-style candies when the tamarind ingredient or
finished candy is produced under good manufacturing practices and not held or
packed in lead glazed bowls that may leach elevated levels of lead into the
pulp or candy.  Because of the low levels of lead found in the sample of
tamarind pulp cited above, as opposed to the much higher lead levels that have
been reported or found in some chili and salt samples, FDA did not calculate
separate lead intake estimates for Mexican-style candy products that contain
tamarind, but not chili or salt.  We believe that the significant sources of
addressable lead exposure from Mexican-style candy products are the chili and
salt ingredients in some products.</p></li>

The FCC is a compendium published by the Food and
Nutrition Board of the Institute of Medicine, National Academy of Sciences, which contains food-grade
specifications for food ingredients; in most cases, these specifications are
eventually incorporated into relevant FDA regulations.  Since we issued the
1995 letter, the FCC specification for lead in sucrose has been reduced from
0.5 ppm to 0.1 ppm.</p>

"Mexican style" refers to candy which contains ingredients popular in Mexico
such as chili and tamarind, which are not typically found in domestic candy in
the U.S. We have included within the broad category of Mexican-style candy,
powdered snack mix products, which are generally made in Mexico and typically
contain combinations of salt, chili powder, sugar and flavoring.  These
products, popular with children and adults, may be sold alongside of candy in
retail outlets, and can be consumed directly from the container like candy, as
well as being sprinkled onto fruits and vegetables or in beverages.</p>

The Total Diet Study is a program that has been conducted continuously by the

Industry sources have reported to the FDA that sugar-based Mexican-style candy
recipes can contain as much as 15% chili, while salt-based products, e.g., some
powdered snack mixes, can contain as much as 30% chili (Ref. 6).</p>
<p><sup><a href="pbcandy.html#ftnref6" name="ftn6">[6]</a></sup>
USDA's Handbook #8 gives a moisture content for hot chili peppers with seeds of
74%, and when dried (with seeds) of 12%.  This equates to a concentration
factor of about 6 from drying.</p>
<p><sup><a href="pbcandy.html#ftnref7" name="ftn7">[7]</a></sup>

 Monte Carlo simulations (Rubinstein, 1981) can be used to evaluate models in which one or
more inputs (in this case, food intakes and lead levels in food) can be defined
by a distribution of values. A Monte Carlo simulation takes a random value from
the distribution of possible values for the input, uses that value in
calculating the outcome of the model, stores the result, and then repeats the
procedure a determined number of times (iterations) using new random values of
the input taken from the distribution for each iteration. The resulting output
from this procedure (e.g., lead intakes) is a range of possible outcomes for
the model. A probability distribution function can be prepared from the range
and can be used to estimate intakes (typically mean and/or 90<sup>th</sup>
percentile) of substances in the diet. </p>
