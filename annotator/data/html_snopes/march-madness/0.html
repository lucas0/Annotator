            Due to reasons you will come to understand as you read on I cannot 
            reveal my identity at this time. Some months ago while trekking through 
            a mountain range on an amateur photo shoot during my holidays, my 
            attention was taken by a glint of light from under a shrub. I discovered 
            it was the suns reflection off a piece of broken glass. </font></font></font>

            the curved polished surface on one side I thought it might have been 
            from some type of magnifying lens. I rummaged around under the shrub 
            wondering if someone had dropped their binoculars, but instead, to 
            my surprise I found a badly damaged camera lens. </font><font color="#FF0000"><font size="5"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I

            the shrub was a stony terrain that lead to the rock face of a sheer 
            cliff towering high above the area. I spotted some other parts of 
            the lens scattered between the rocks. Then I found the main body of 
            the camera. It was an Olympus OM40 SLR, which was in production during 
            the early eighties. The entire camera was smashed and covered in a 
            silvery soot-like powder, as if it had been thrown onto a fire. Yet, 
            on closer inspection, there was some oxidization on parts of the exposed 
            metal casing. It had obviously been there for quite some time.</font></font></font>

          </p><p align="left"><font color="#FF0000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="5">My 
            first thought was that someone must have dropped the camera from the 
            top of the cliff causing it to shatter on the rocks below, and that 
            there must have been a raging fire through the valley at some stage. 
            Taking a closer look at my surroundings there were no signs of recent 
            fires. Had someone tried to destroy the camera by burning it? When 
            I sniffed the soot it had a pungent explosives-like smell to it. I 
            turned it over and wiped the film cartridge display window. The hair 
            on the back of my neck stood on end. <b>There was still film in the 
            camera.<br/>
</b><br/>
            It was late evening by the time I arrived home some days later. I'd 
            been having mysterious dreams about the camera every night since I 
            found it. Overwhelmed with curiosity and excited anticipation, I immediately 
            took the camera to my darkroom. I had to pry the back open with a 
            screwdriver as the plastic section of the outer casing had melted 
            then solidified over the cover. Most of the film was badly damaged, 
            parts of it having disintegrated due to extreme heat. I developed 
            the strips of film that were salvageable. Nearly all of the negatives 
            were color distorted.<b> The images on the film sent chills down my 
            spine</b>. When I finally developed the photos and blew them up, I 
            couldn't believe what I was seeing. <b>It made me wonder what the 
            hell was about to happen on the planet! </b><br/>

            I began doing research on the net, looking for clues, desperately 
            trying to find anything that could explain the images in the photos. 
            I used key words in the search engine - words that exactly described 
            the images. <b>That's when all hell broke loose</b>. After a few minutes 
            the cursor suddenly started moving by itself, followed by a 'whirring' 
            noise from the hard-disk. I froze with anticipation and by the time 
            I thought to unplug the phone line it had stopped. I had never experienced 
            anything like this before, but I'd been told by a friend that if the 
            cursor ever moved by itself and there was a 'whirring' from the hard-drive, 
            they were the sure signs that indicated someone was hacking into my 
            computer. I picked up the handset to phone my friend. I wanted to 
            tell him what had just happened. My eyes bugged with surprise as I 
            heard a 'clicking' sound. <b>Someone was tapping my phone.</b> My 
            gut feeling told me to get the hell out of the house.<br/>
<br/>
            I threw the camera, the photos and negatives into a bag. I was shaking 
            with nervous tension - freaking out! I got into my four-wheel drive 
            parked across the road and sat there for a while, wondering whether 
            I was losing the plot. Was I allowing paranoia to take over? <b>Maybe 
            I'd read too many conspiracy novels over the years.<br/>
</b><br/>
            Suddenly a black van with tinted windows pulled up outside my house. 
            I ducked down as a woman and a man got out and went to the front door. 
            When they knocked on it, I cursed myself, because I'd left it open. 
            The woman called out my name and they went inside. I got out of the 
            car and hid behind some bushes in a neighbors front yard. It was about 
            twenty minutes before they came back out. Heading for their van, they 
            looked around, as if they knew I'd be close by. It was fairly dark, 
            but I could make out that they were both dressed fairly casually in 
            jeans and a pullover. The woman had long black hair. It wasn't until 
            about an hour after they'd gone that I found enough courage to venture 
            out from behind the bushes.<br/>
<br/>
            When I finally went inside I discovered they'd been through my things 
            and had left a message on my computer:<br/>
<br/>
<b>"We need to discuss why you used <i>particular</i> words on 
            the net search engine this evening."<br/>
<br/>
</b>They'd left a telephone number and told me to call it the moment 
            I got in. After going through my things and not finding anything, 
            I presumed they'd come to the conclusion that my using the words relating 
            to the images must have been coincidental. I decided to bide my time, 
            not to make any hasty decisions. The film I developed clearly related 
            to a top secret of some kind. <b>I shuddered at the thought of their 
            response if they knew I actually had photos specifically relating 
            to what I was searching for on the web!<br/>
</b><br/>
            I didn't know what to do. Maybe they were secret agents! But from 
            where? Was it governmental or a privately run faction? And what were 
            their intentions? Was I in danger? I then remembered a friend telling 
            me that everything on the net is scanned at a classified central processing 
            agency. And that considering the threat of extremist factions these 
            days, if you were to use certain words that potentially related to 
            national security issues, you could easily be tracked down and taken 
            in for questioning.<br/>
<br/>
            All I know is this: <b>I haven't done anything wrong!</b> But if my 
            presumption about the subject matter in the photos are right, then 
            something big is about to take place. Something that will affect the 
            entire planet and every living thing on it - <b>something I believe 
            the public has a right to know.</b> At first I didn't know how to 
            go about getting the information out there. I knew I'd be tracked 
            down if I tried to go to the media. Not to mention that they'd probably 
            pass me off as a crackpot.<br/>
<br/>
            I packed some bags that night and decided to take off around the country, 
            while I tried to sort this thing out in my mind. <b>That was the worst 
            thing I could have done.</b> After a few days I realized that running 
            away was like admitting to the agents in the black van that I did 
            have something to hide. I had a close call at a motel. On my way back 
            from going out to get a burger I discovered the same van parked a 
            few streets away. They'd probably tracked me down through the use 
            of my credit card. I headed for the bank to withdraw all my funds. 
            It was too late. My bank account and credit facilities had been frozen. 
            <b>This was big! </b>I left my four-wheel drive at the motel and got 
            the first bus out of town.<br/>
<br/>
            What I had stumbled across while trekking through the mountains that 
            day was obviously information that certain factions have no intention 
            of allowing to become public knowledge. That was why they had tried 
            to destroy the photographic evidence in the first place. <b>But what 
            I've discovered must be given to the world</b>. I've decided to reveal 
            the photos on <b>march 8th 2003 </b>with any other information I've 
            been able to find during my research. Soon after I will reveal the 
            geographic location where I found the camera.<br/>
<br/>
            I did put my trust in a dear friend. He has supported me financially 
            and helped me create a new identity. <b>I am preparing for a mass 
            release via the internet so that it can't be stopped.</b> It is imperative 
            that <i>all</i> people, not just those open to alternative views, 
            are made aware of this event. Particularly the younger generation 
            who represent the very future and survival of our world. That is why 
            I have chosen to reveal my story and warning in such a novel way. 
            <br/>
<br/>
            I only use computers at internet cafés. I do not remain in one city, 
            state or country for any length of time. I must keep on the move. 
            <b>I must not allow them to stop me or trace my whereabouts.</b> I 
            have set the date for the release in the future to allow time to build 
            publicity. With the worlds full attention, these secret agencies or 
            privately run factions cannot deny or lie to the public about what 
            I will reveal.<br/>
<br/>
            I know there will be those of you who will judge this to be some sort 
            of fantastic publicity stunt. But remember, things are not always 
            as they seem. Make no hasty assessment about this event until you 
            have seen the images in the photos. Reserve your judgement...until 
            then...when <i>all</i> will be revealed. Then you can decide what 
            is or isn't real.<br/>
<br/>
            In hope for our future,<br/>

          the net I've discovered many comments posted on message boards regarding 
          this site. <font color="#0000FF">There are those who believe it is a 
          hoax - but perhaps that is part of the plan - just read between the 
          lines.<font color="#FF0000"> Some have suggested it is a publicity campaign</font></font> 
          for a new movie thriller. Even a new computer game has been put forward. 
          Others have stated that nothing will happen on March 8th 2003. Let me 
          assure you that the photo's will be posted on that date.</font>
</p><p><font color="#FF0000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="5">The 
          most common question asked: "Why am I waiting to post the photos?" 
          Besides the obvious fact of building momentum, there is indeed a very 
          good reason and that will also be revealed. As you will learn, the timing 
          of this date holds much significance in the bigger scheme of things. 
          It has been suggested that prophecies by the ancient Seers and Soothsayers 
          of the distant past, speak of what I have uncovered.</font></p>
<p><font color="#FF0000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="5">The 
          deeper I delve the more I discover, and the more I realize I have only 
          touched the tip of the iceberg. Information and validation is being 
          leaked to me from a small resistance group within the ranks of those 
          who are trying to track me down. They contacted me because they are 
          sympathetic to my cause and believe humanity has a right to know what 
          I will disclose. By the time I release the photos I hope to have all 
          the pieces of the jigsaw.</font></p>
<p><font color="#FF0000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="5">Mystery 
          revealed: A guy posted a message saying he couldn't understand why the 
          person who tried to destroy the camera, didn't simply remove the film 
          and expose it to light - an astute and sensible observation. Since posting 
          this site I have restored some of the more severely damaged negatives, 
          and I can now tell you that the camera was NOT thrown onto a fire and 
          it was NOT scorched in a forest inferno. Once you see the images you 
          will understand; things are not always as they seem. Be patient and 
          all will be revealed.</font></p>
<p><font color="#FF0000" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="5">I 
          will keep you informed.</font></p>

          to the radio stations that have mentioned my site and offered to interview 
          me on their programs, but I must keep low for now. </font></p>
