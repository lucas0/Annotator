he smiled and said she's doing so well right now at<br/>
staying stable that he took her off the ventilator<br/>
that she was on and put her on one that we start<br/>
surgery on her burns.  This was the step we've been<br/>
waiting for.  They put her on it at 10:30 this morning<br/>
and so far she's doing great!  Your prayers and GODS<br/>
grace have gotten her this far so please continue to<br/>
keep Delaney in your prayers.  Some people have asked<br/>
what her blood type is and how you go about donating<br/>
blood for her.  Her blood type is A+, you can do a<br/>
direct donation if you are A+ or you can do a<br/>
replacement donation in her name.  Just tell them who<br/>
it is for and that she is at Parkland Hospital,<br/>
Dallas, Texas.  This should be all the information<br/>
they need.  Around the Houston area you can donate at<br/>
the Gulf Coast Regional Blood Center or the Dallas<br/>
area at Carter Blood Centers.  Scott &amp; White will not<br/>
take replacements or directed units the blood you<br/>
donate there stays there for their hospital.  You can<br/>
call 1-888-GVBLOOD to get a location near you.  Thank<br/>
you all again. We are very BLESSED to have family and<br/>
friends like all of you. I have faith I will be<br/>
writing more good news tomorrow!!!!!!<br/>

<p align="center">Well today is Sunday and I am very sorry I didn't<br/>
update last night.  We've had a busy weekend.  Delaney<br/>
is still progressing very well.  She is now at 55%<br/>
oxygen and holding her own.  The burns on her face has<br/>
healed and the scabs have fallen off, they look great.<br/>
 Of coarse where the burns were it is dark pink, but<br/>
I'm sure it will fade with time.  The nurse told me<br/>
there are some areas that are healing up that they<br/>
thought would need skin graphs and probably won't now.<br/>
 They are small areas but we'll take what we can get.<br/>
They said surgery next week some time towards the end<br/>
maybe Friday.  One of the nurses said she's doing so<br/>
well that she can't see them waiting that long.  She's<br/>
really going to need the prayers when surgery starts.<br/>
They said she will take a dive after a surgery and to<br/>
expect it. If she is burned 35% of her body and they<br/>
have to take skin from 15% of her body then that's 50%<br/>
that has to heal.  Which of coarse is harder on that<br/>
little body.  She has come so far and has had so many<br/>
people praying for her that I am very confident that<br/>
she will breeze right through it all.  She's a strong,<br/>
tough and courageous little girl, her daddy and I are<br/>
very proud.  Her sister and brother came down this<br/>
weekend and it was so wonderful to see them.  We miss<br/>
them so very much.  Caitlyn was able to talk to the<br/>
counselor at the hospital and she took Caitlyn in to<br/>
see Delaney.  She did very well.  There were rumors<br/>
around where we live that Delaney had to have both<br/>
arms amputated and Caitlyn heard about it, so she had<br/>
to see for herself that it wasn't true.  Caitlyn is a<br/>
real trooper.  Clayton, our 3 yr. old doesn't really<br/>
say or ask much.  He says he can't wait for HIS<br/>
Delaney to come home.  With all the prayer and our<br/>
trust in the LORD, it will happen real soon. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks and GOD BLESS,<br/>
Deana and Deven<br/>

Today was a good day.  She was doing so well that they<br/>
lowered her oxygen to 50% and decided to take her off<br/>
the paralyzing medication.  We are not to sure about<br/>
this due to the fact she will be waking up and wanting<br/>
Mommy.  We wont be able to hold her yet.  This is<br/>
going to kill Mom.  We saw her at the last visit and<br/>
she was moving her mouth and tongue, and made a few<br/>
sounds.  We are wondering if she will be awake in the<br/>
morning.  They plan on surgery Friday if all stays<br/>
well.  This is going to be a trying time for her.  We<br/>
will let everyone know if they change the date.  Keep<br/>
the prayers coming and we will update you tomorrow. <br/>

O.K. I think things are starting to go a little faster<br/>
than what we expected.  Don't get me wrong we are<br/>
happy, we just were not expecting all that happened<br/>
today.  Today Delaney was taken off another<br/>
medication(medication that kept her relaxed), her<br/>
oxygen level was lowered to 40% and she tried opening<br/>
her eyes.  While the doc. was fixing her trac. she let<br/>
out a cry.  Tomorrow she should be more alert.  Thank<br/>
you everyone for all your prayers, support, and love.<br/>
Someone asked if Delaney can listen to tapes, she does<br/>
have a tape player in her room.  GOD continues to<br/>
answer all our prayers and to him we give thanks for<br/>
Delaney's healing.   <br/>

We wanted to let everyone know that Delaney's surgery<br/>
is at 0730 Friday morning.  They plan on grafting her<br/>
left arm and exploring her fingers to see what can be<br/>
saved.  She opened her eyes a little and cried when a<br/>
friend of ours talked to her.  She still doesn't move<br/>
around much which makes it easier on the nurses. <br/>
There is really not much more to pass on so we will<br/>
let ya'll know tomorrow. <br/>

Well the first surgery is over and Delaney did very well. The <br/>
surgery took little over an hour but they only grafted her left <br/>
arm, left hand (top and palm), top of her left foot and they <br/>
did have to remove part of her pinky (down to the knuckle) and<br/>
 part of her ring finger (just the tip) she still has her nail. <br/>
He said we'll watch that ring finger to make sure no more needs <br/>
to come off. He was real good about leaving even the littlest bit<br/>
 if he thought there would be a chance for it to heal. She used <br/>
150cc of blood during the surgery and they were going to check her<br/>
 blood count a little later to see if she needs anymore. <br/>
If she heals well and stays stable then we'll probably have the <br/>
second surgery next week.  Then he will be grafting the chest and<br/>
 some small places on her right leg and arm.  We were pleased to <br/>
hear that he's almost certain that her breast buds were not burnt<br/>
 and she would not have any problems with developement.  We'll <br/>
cross that bridge when we get there.  I can't thank everyone <br/>
enough for all the prayers and support Deven and I have received.<br/>
  I truly believe that without the prayers things wouldn't have <br/>
gone this well for our baby.  One nurse told me that in all the <br/>
years he's been there he has never seen a child that small with <br/>
burns as severe as Delaneys recover as quickly as she has.  When<br/>
 he told me that I knew the only reason why is because of  <br/>
THE LORD JESUS CHRIST.  We'll be going in and making short visits<br/>
 throughout the day so if there are any changes I  will inform <br/>
everyone tonight. <br/>

We just don't know what to do with these good days but we will take them! <br/>
Today they had her off the resperatior and on a trac brace<br/>
( mask that fits over the trac hole, doesn't breathe for her just provides her with oxygen )<br/>they have got her on 20 -30 minute trials. They also <br/>
took her off the morphine drip and give it to her as needed.  She seems<br/>
to be doing very well with this.  Her second surgery is scheduled for<br/>
Friday if all stays well.  They unwrapped the grafted areas today, there<br/>
still mesh gauze on the grafts but the nurse said it looked good.  They<br/>
will know tomorrow when they take the mesh off if the grafts stuck.  She<br/>
will look around the room at us, moves her body a little, and she even<br/>
watched a little t.v. today.  We are very proud of her progress but<br/>
they are still letting us know she can go down hill at any time.  But<br/>
she is stronger than that!  Everyone is very optimistic.  Well it is<br/>
time to go and see her we will give her kisses from everyone.<br/>
Thanks for the prayers. <br/>

Today we've had a little set back.  When they unwrapped the grafted areas <br/>
the foot, arm and the palm of her hand looked great, but the top of her <br/>
hand the the fingers did not take.  The nurse said the skin graft did not <br/>
stick and it just moves all around.  They will go in and regraft it on <br/>
friday when they do the chest and a little on the right arm the doctor <br/>
said.  Also the area that they took the skin from (donor site) instead of <br/>
drying like it should her body is treating it like a second degree burn so <br/>
they are having to wrap and apply medication on both of her thighs where <br/>
they took the skin from.  It's kind of a set back, which we were expecting,<br/>
 but that didn't mean we wanted it to happen!  We are still thinking positive<br/>
 and pray the surgery on friday goes well.  As far as her health they say <br/>
everything is going great.  We want to thank everyone who has donated blood<br/>
and apologize if any of you got the run around at the hospitals or blood<br/>
centers.  You would think they would make it easier to donate blood for<br/>
someone.  We would like to send thank you cards to everyone could you <br/>

Well there's a lot to tell everyone.  Yesterday they took her off the <br/>
respirator and put her on the trac collar to see how long she could breathe <br/>
without assistance.  She is still of the trac collar.  They can't believe how <br/>
good she is doing.  She is more alert and the nurses have fun with her at night. <br/>
They said she didn't fall asleep till 12:00 am.  I got to hold her for the first time <br/>
today.  It was an awsome feeling.  She doesn't have much expression, but she <br/>
sure was rooting around wanting to nurse so in went the pacifer!  Surgery is <br/>
tomorrow at around 0730.  This surgery should be alot easier for her since she is <br/>
stronger and there is less grafting.  They are still worried about her breast <br/>
buds being damaged and part of her ring finger needing to be removed.  There have <br/>
been a few nurses say if we forget to come get her they are taking her home with them. <br/>
 (those are fighting words!)<br/>
Also some things we have been told, now that she is doing a whole lot better,<br/>
 is there wasn't much hope for her to have made it this far.  Goes to show what <br/>
the POWER OF PRAYERS and the GOOD LORD can do.<br/>
We will let everyone know how surgery goes.<br/>
Thank you all so much,<br/>

It's Saturday and I'm sure a lot of you are wondering about the surgery <br/>
so here it goes...........They ended up having to graft a little more than <br/>
we expected.  Her right foot (top), a strip around the top of her right arm, <br/>
chest, re-grafted the couple of areas on her left arm and finger, and they <br/>
did have to amputate her ring finger on her left hand to the first little <br/>
knuckle.  So she has no fingernails on her pinky and ring finger.  Trying to <br/>
ease the tension a little I said  "I guess when she has her nails done they'll<br/>
 have to give her a discount!"  When we told Caitlyn and Clayton about it <br/>
Clayton just said "OH!" and Caitlyn said "I don't care abount her fingers being<br/>
 gone as long as I still have a sister."  I was pretty impressed.  They miss <br/>
her so much.  They put her back on the vintilator durning surgery and we had<br/>
 planned on her being on it for atleast the whole day and some of the next, <br/>
but by the 5:00 visitation she was back on the trac collar and doing great.<br/>
Today when I went in for the 3:00 visit they had the trac out and she is totally <br/>
breathing on her own!!!!  She cried and I could hear her.  I feels like It's <br/>
been ages since I heard her cry.  I just rubbed her head and told her to cry it's ok. <br/>
 The only time she cries is when someone messes with her.  Other times she just <br/>
stares at us and follows us with her eyes around the room.  I keep trying to make<br/>
 her smile so I can see those four teeth  but she just won't do it yet.  The nurses <br/>
told us she probably wouldn't smile for a while. " When she's all better she'll <br/>
let you know", they say.  My mother-in-law was talking to the respitory doctor <br/>
and she was telling him how she was our little miracle baby and he said she's <br/>
a miracle baby three times over.  He loves Delaney.  He says she talks to him <br/>
all the time so he lets us know what she says.  He has been so wonderful to <br/>
us and Delaney.  They might take h er around in the wagon on Sunday.  We'll see. <br/>
 She looks like the Stay Puff Marshmellow Man.  They have her all wrapped up.  <br/>
It will all come off Monday or Tuesday so they'll be able to see how well the <br/>
grafts look.  Well I have to go to visit her.  I'll talk to everyone tomorrow.<br/>

I,m sorry I haven't updated in a couple of days but it's been something else<br/>
around here.  Saturday Deven had to go back to work.  It was killing him but we<br/>
 have to pay the bills so he left and told me to call him after every visit.  Nothing<br/> really changed on Saturday.  Sunday however there were many.  They had Delaney <br/>
off the ventilator and on the mask, she was on the mask about two or three days and<br/> when I went in to visit her Sunday they had taken the trac out and she was breathing<br/> on her own.  I was shocked because I didn't think they were going to do that <br/>
until they checked out the grafts to make sure they took.  They seemed pretty <br/>
confident about everything so I just went with the flow. Then they told me they were<br/> going to try her with a bottle and if she did well then I could try to nurse her.<br/>
I couldn't believe it.  She took the bottle just fine and she didn't forget how to<br/> nurse!  Yesterday was more amazing!  It's a good thing everyone is setting down <br/>because when I got there for the 8:00 visit they had her all dolled up with a <br/>
bow in her hair looking all clean and the big bulky bandages off (she looked like a <br/>
little angel)  her bright blue eyes were shining.  The doctor came in and said <br/>
you know she's going to be moved down the hall tomorrow.  I asked if he was joking <br/>
and he said no I'm not joking.  I think my jaw fell to the ground because once <br/>
they get moved down the hall they get to go home after 2-3 days!!!! So were looking <br/>
at probably Saturday!  Deven's mom started to cry from joy but I stood there in<br/>
 total amazment.  I haven't been able to cry, laugh, smile or anything .  All I <br/>
can think is less than a month ago I didn't think I would have a baby anymore, <br/>
Deven and I were giving her to the LORD because we knew she was so bad and in <br/>
so much pain and in less than a month she's going home.  It's just too much to<br/>
 grasp all at one time.  I know that little girl has seen JESUS and played with <br/>
the angels while her body healed there's no doubt about that.  She is our little<br/>miracle baby and GOD has something special planned for her. <br/>
 Today, Tuesday,  at the 8:00 a.m. visit they had the feeding tube out of <br/>
her nose and she's eating baby food (they even ordered some ice cream for <br/>
her today) and they took the cathadere out.  All she has left to take out is<br/>
 the I.V.  and that will probably be today.  She is taking all meds by mouth. <br/>
 They are not going to move her out of ICU today like planned because there isn't <br/>
a room avalible but the nurse don't mind a bit.  They want her to stay there.  <br/>
All of this would not have happened without the wonderful prayers from everyone. <br/>
 We just can't thank everyone enough.  They unwrapped her left hand and arm today <br/>
and it was real hard to look at it.  It looks pretty bad.  To the nurses and doctors <br/>
it looks good but to me it was bad.  I know it's all going to heal and she'll do <br/>
great in life but she's my baby and right now it's hard.  All of the grafts took <br/>
very well so there will be no more surgeries any time soon.  Plus today she got to <br/>
go on that wagon ride we've been waiting on!  Deven came back last night and he was<br/>
 here to take her on that ride.  It meant more to him than anyone can imagine. <br/>
 Thank You All for all the love and support.  I will be staying here when she<br/>
 gets out of the hospital for at least three weeks for intense therapy.  She'll<br/>
 have to go five days a week.  Then it will start to tapper off  there.  <br/>
Thanks again. <br/> Deana <br/>

O.K. I'm going to try this again.  I have written<br/>
three e-mails and none have gone through to anyone. <br/>
For those of you that don't know already, Delaney is<br/>
out of the hospital.  She is doing so well.  She was<br/>
released a week ago this past friday.  It was a real<br/>
shocker.  They took her out of ICU on a wednesday and<br/>
put her in the acute care unit and by friday she was<br/>
released.  This past Thursday we took her to the burn<br/>
clinic and the doctors just couldn't believe how she<br/>
looked.  All we can say is it's the work of the LORD<br/>
no doubt!!!!!  She is smiling, laughing, playing and<br/>
being as cute as can be.  I know we have told everyone<br/>
thank you but we can't say it enough.  If it wasn't<br/>
for all the thoughts, love and prayers I know she<br/>
wouldn't have done so well so fast.  Caitlyn and<br/>
clayton are doing so well with her.  At first Caitlyn<br/>
wanted to hide Delaney's hand and I told her we can't<br/>
do that, we have to let Delaney know it's o.k. and<br/>
nothing to be ashamed of.  After a while of thinking<br/>
about it Caitlyn said "Your right, she's alive and<br/>
that's all that matters."  I was so proud.  Clayton<br/>
said her hand looked nasty and he wasn't going to<br/>
touch it.  I told him it's o.k. he didn't have to. A<br/>
couple of days later he kissed it and told her he<br/>
loved her.  Now none of it's a big deal to either. <br/>
When we do therapy on it  of coarse Delaney screams so<br/>
they both come into the room and sing, dance and make<br/>
silly sounds to her to get her mind off what we're<br/>
doing.  They are a big help.  We are battling the<br/>
insurance company about thr right kind of therapy she<br/>
needs.  They don't have a pediatric burn therapist in<br/>
the insurance group and want to send her to a plastic<br/>
surgeon.  Monday and Tuesday we are going to Scott and<br/>
White to talk to them more about the insurance and<br/>
then we will be going back to Tyler for more therapy<br/>
there.  I really like the therapist there.  Plus we are<br/>
able to stay with Deven's parents.  His mom is out of<br/>
school for the summer and she is loving having the<br/>
grandkids there.  Poor Delaney has a long road ahead<br/>
of her.  There is going a lot more surgeries and a lot<br/>
of therapy, but we'll get through it all just fine. <br/>
I'll tell you what, this has really made Deven and I<br/>
rethink how we want to live our lives with our<br/>
childern.  Deven's going to cut down on work hours, if<br/>
there's a fair in town we're taking the kids, we're<br/>
going on vacations, there's so much we want to change.<br/>
It's going to be interesting.  I'll let everyone know<br/>
how this next week goes.  <br/>

Just wanted to let everyone know how well Delaney is<br/>
doing. She is going to therapy everyday. Her burns are <br/>
healing very well. This past Friday Deven and I took<br/>
her to Dallas for a check-up and they were amazed at<br/>
how well she looked. They said she will have minimal<br/>
scaring. Everyday she wears her pressure garments.<br/>
These are to help smooth out the skin grafting and<br/>
help her heal even better. She wont crawl yet but we<br/>
are working on that everyday. She most likely will<br/>
have to have surgery on her left hand because the skin<br/>
is too tight and her fingers are curving downward. It<br/>
looks like her middle finger and ring finger are<br/>
trying to web together so that will also have to be<br/>
fixed. But we are hanging in there and could never had<br/>
made it this far without all of everyones support.<br/>
Thank you all so very much for continuing to keep us<br/>
in your prayers. God is soo wonderful and we will<br/>
never forget that and Delaney will grow up to know<br/>
that always. Thank you all very much.<br/>

Deven and Deana do not have access right now to a computer as they are<br/>
living with a family that does not have one.  They are waiting on their<br/>
house being built and Deana continues to take Delaney every day back and<br/>
forth from Lampasas to Temple.  We need prayers for Deana, Deven, Clayton <br/>
and Caitlyn now, as they are suffering from the aftershocks of this horrible <br/> accident.  Delaney continues to heal and progress well, but she absolutely<br/>
abhors her physical therapy and occupational therapy. We are told she<br/>
will not remember any of this, but when ones baby screams and cries when<br/>
her affected areas are touched and looks at her Momma like<br/>
"How could you do this to me?"<br/>
It has an affect on us all.  They still have many long days ahead<br/>
with her therapy, but we know God will continue to meet the needs of<br/>
this precious family.  Thank you for all you have done!<br/>

I just finished talking to Deana, Delaney's Mom and she said the<br/>
surgeon said he wants to do more skin grafting on her hand as it is causing<br/>
her thumb to pull in. They can't do that though until the hand is completely<br/>
healed.  The most recent blessing is that she is no longer screaming and<br/>
crying when they do the therapy, she just kind of makes loud noises to tell<br/>
them to "stop messing with me". Ha! We still need prayer for two areas:<br/>
She has lost weight as she only wants bottles, no solid food and she isn't<br/>
sleeping through the night since the accident.  We are taking Clayton and<br/>
Caitlyn to Springfield, Missouri on Saturday to see their Uncle Adam and<br/>
Aunt Sarah, which will give Deana and Deven a little break, as well as the<br/>
kids a few less trips to Scott and White.  Thank you for your continuing<br/>
prayers, we truly appreciate them.  Hopefully they will be in their house in<br/>
the next 3-4 weeks.<br/>God Bless You All!<br/>

The doctor's have decided that she will have 3 surgeries when she is<br/>
completely healed.  Two on her hand and one on the bend of her elbow. She<br/>
continues to thrive and has already outgrown her first body suit.  I<br/>
mentioned that she only wants her bottle last update, but now she is wanting<br/>
only people food, not baby food.  She has 6 teeth now and pushes all of her<br/>
food to the front of her mouth so she can chew it.  One of the beautiful<br/>
things that has happened is Deana was worried about people's reaction to her<br/>
in the store....well, Deana can hardly get out of any store because people<br/>
stop and ask her what happened.  Deana said when they stare......Delaney<br/>
breaks out in her smile and that eases the tension and then they usually ask<br/>
what her injuries are.  It is a slow uphill walk, but God's faithfulness to<br/>
her cannot be denied.  Thank you for your continued prayers.<br/>

Deven and Deana took Delaney to Parkland hospital for her monthly check<br/>
with them.  Scott and White Hospital, who are their insurance provider<br/>
does not recognize Parkland as her health provider, so Deven and Deana<br/>
pay these visits out of pocket. These persons at Parkland are the true<br/>
burn specialists and have decided as of today Delaney needs surgery on<br/>
her hand by the end of the month.  Her elbow also needs straightening,<br/>
however,they want to cast her arm and see if it will straighten with that<br/>
procedure. They did not anticipate this surgery this soon, but because she<br/>
is growing so fast, as only those little ones do, the surgery is indicated<br/>
now.Our prayer is that Parkland will have a short persuasion time with<br/>
Scott and White to have Delaney's surgery done by Parkland.  This is so<br/>
important because they are the experts at Parkland and this is their field<br/>
of expertise. Deven and Deana also took Delaney by the ICU where she was<br/>
for the first 3 weeks, and the male nurse who admitted her was there this <br/>
time. He got tears in his eyes when he saw her and all of the other nurses said,<br/>
 "They will never forget those blue eyes".<br/>
It means so much to the nurses who minister to these critically<br/>
injured children to see them healing, smiling and growing.<br/>
Again, we say thank you for your prayers and concerns, because this is<br/>
what has held us all together the past 4 months.  Deana and Deven are hoping<br/>
to be into their house in the next 3 weeks.  Pray also that things will go<br/>
smoothly there, as anyone who has built a house knows the little hindrances<br/>
that have a way of creeping up.<br/>

Hi everyone.  I'm at my moms and using her computer so I figured I'd update<br/>
everyone on Delaney.  She's just as happy as can be.  Always smiling, laughing<br/>
and keeping me on my toes.  She hasn't let any of this slow her down.<br/>
We still go to therapy everyday.  That does get a little hard on all of us<br/>
but we know how important it is so we make the best of it.  It is getting a<br/>
lot easier.  I know there were some people worried about me but I'm letting <br/>
everyone know that I am just fine.  I'm not going to crack or break down and go <br/>
crazy like some might think and I don't need to be on medication. HA! I have <br/>
days that I break down and CRY along with Delaney when I'm doing therapy or <br/>
changing her garments because it hurts her therefore it hurts me!  I think <br/>it's only natural that I do hurt with her and I would be worried about someone that <br/>
didn't cry for their hurting child.  I involve the other two children in <br/>
everything and tell them everything we're told from the doctors.  They are <br/>
such a big help in therapy.  They play and act goofy while the therapist are <br/>
working on her.  She loves it.  As far as the house is concerned,  that is <br/>
something we started before this even happened to Delaney.  We don't expect <br/>
anyone to help us out.  That was something Deven and I started together and <br/>
we've had some help from our parents and a couple of friends.  We are about <br/>
2-3 weeks away from being in it.  So please don't think we're desperate and <br/>
need the help.  We are fine where we are at right now.  We are staying with <br/>
one of Deven's best friends and his wife and children.  It is 6 miles from <br/>
our house so we work on it every evening and his buddy Clayton (who we're <br/>
staying with) has done all the electrical work and air conditioning for us.<br/>
Please don't anyone worry about us.  Deven and I have a very strong, open and <br/>
loving marriage.  We talk to each other all the time about how we are feeling <br/>
and things that are going on with our lives and family. Right now we are <br/>
just concentrating on our family and what needs to be done to make Delaney <br/>
all better.  As far as other surgeries go,  we went to Dallas yesterday <br/>
and the doctor that performed her other surgeries looked at her and they <br/>
are very concerned about her hand and elbow.  He says they would like to do <br/>
surgery right away.  They are afraid that her middle finger and little ring <br/>
finger won't grow with the rest of them because the scar is so thick.  The <br/>
finger will not straighten out at all. Her elbow won't either.  They put <br/>
her elbow in a cast hoping to straighten it out a little so they can wait <br/>
on surgery on the elbow until the scar matures.  The finger can't wait and <br/>
needs to be done by the end of the month. They are going to try to talk <br/>
to the insurance about letting them do the surgeries in Dallas.  We would <br/>
feel a lot better about that because they did such a wonderful job the <br/>
first time.  Again please pray that we're able to go to dallas for her <br/>
surgeries.  I will let everyone know what we find out and when it will all <br/>
take place.  Thank you all again for all the wonderful e-mails, thoughts and prayers.<br/>
                              God Bless, Deana<br/>

Hi I just wanted to let everyone know that Delaney's arm looks to be doing <br/>
very well with the cast on. They removed the cast Tuesday and I was amazed at the<br/> softness of the scars and how straight the arm was. After a while of leaving it <br/>
off you could tell it was wanting to drawl up again and was starting to get <br/>
hard again.  They made her another cast that we can take on and off as <br/>
needed.  Hopefully this will prevent her from needing surgery on that arm to <br/>
soon.  The finger and hand still need surgery right away.  We are still waiting <br/>
on the hospital and insurance co. to call.  I put in an application at Shriners <br/>
to see if they can take a look at her.  I've heard they do wonderful work.<br/>
I'll update as I get more information.<br/>

                           Thanks,

                                  Deana<br/>

Great news!  Delaney has been preapproved by Shriners Hospital.<br/>
There is a Shriners Hospital in Austin, and they will drive out<br/>
to Lampasas and pick Delaney up for her therapy, or will pay gas<br/>
for Deana to drive her into Austin.  We are hoping that she will<br/>
fully approved by September 7 when her next surgery on her hand is<br/>
scheduled.  She has been wearing a cast on her left arm and not<br/>
only is the arm incredibly straight, but the cast is smoothing out<br/>
the burned areas!  There is also a lotion called Demarkable made by<br/>
Beauty Control that is causing the scarring to smooth out and return<br/>
to normal color faster than anything they have used so far. Deana<br/>
and Deven should be moving into their house in the next two weeks.<br/>
God has truly worked miracles through this family and again, we<br/>
can't say enough......thank you for your prayers, and may God bless<br/>
each of you to overflowing measure.<br/>

They will spend their first night their tonight.  90% of the tile is in,<br/>
kitchen cabinets are in, someone donated the second commode for their<br/>
mudroom, Deana's sister and brother-in-law gave them 4 inside doors.<br/>
They are all very tired, but so relieved to be in their house.<br/>
We rejoice with them!  Thank you all again for your prayers!<br/>

 Just wanted to apologize for not updating recently.<br/>
 Deven and I have been really busy lately. We have<br/>
 finally moved into our home, just in time for<br/>
 Delaney's first birthday Sept. 1. Delaney has been<br/>
 doing soo well and she is sooo happy. She had surgery<br/>
 today the 13th of Sept. The surgery went extremely<br/>
 well. They took layers of skin from her groin areas<br/>
 and cut the palm of her hand to put some skin in that<br/>
 area. This will allow the skin to losen up and not be<br/>
 soo tight. Her arm is in a cast as this procedure<br/>
 begins to heal. Delaney was in surgery for 3 hours.<br/>
 They did more than what they anticipated, but the<br/>
 doctors say all went very well. Yesterday she started<br/>
 to crawl again for the first time since the accident.<br/>
 Since having this surgery I guess it will take some<br/>
 time before she tries to crawl again. We are just sooooo<br/>
 happy that she is doing soo well and is in good<br/>
spirits. We are very happy to finally be in our own<br/>
 home. It is such a great relief. We do not have a home<br/>
 phone yet. The phone company has to do some line work<br/>
 first and we were told it could take up to a month. As<br/>
 soon as we get phone service we will let everyone<br/>
 know. Once again Deven and I wanted to thank everyone<br/>
 for their tremendous support and prayers. Once we get<br/>
 settled we will be sending out thank you cards. The<br/>
 cards just dont say enough how much we thank everyone.<br/>
 We will update as often as we can. GOD Bless everyone.<br/>


 Thank you all soo much,<br/>

Delaney had her first visit at Shriner's in Galveston today.<br/>
They said she looked great and Deana could discontinue the every<br/>
day therapy at Scott and White in Temple.  She has been doing this<br/>
since June! They gave her some new anti-itching medicine, as Delaney<br/>
has not had many full night sleeps because of the itching.  They<br/>
have also placed her on a high fiber, high calorie diet because burn<br/>
victims lose muscle and bone the first year after the trauma.  They<br/>
also fit her with a new Jobst garment and splint for her hand.<br/>
This is a huge answer to prayer for us because Scott and White was<br/>
NOT meeting her needs.  In fact the last surgery they did was not the<br/>
correct procedure for burn patients today.  However, this hospital<br/>
would not admit to a lack of knowledge for pediatric burn care.<br/>
Shriners will come and pick up Delaney and my daugher-in-law in Lampasas,<br/>
take them to Galveston, put them up in a motel for the night and<br/>
take them home the next day.  They will have no more financial outlay!<br/>
Praise God, He does take care of His little ones!  Thank you again for<br/>
all of your prayer and voices of inquiry and concern!  God Bless You!.<br/>

Hi everyone, <br/>
Well there's a lot to tell everyone.  I guess that's<br/>
what happens when it takes a month to get a phone line<br/>
put out in the boonies and no one provides the<br/>
Internet out here. Delaney is doing so wonderful.  I know she's<br/>
my child but that has got to be the most strongest and<br/>
happiest baby I've ever seen.  So many people can't<br/>
get past that smile of hers to even see that she's<br/>
burned.  It is such a blessing.  Another blessing is<br/>
that We took her to Shriners in Galveston on Tuesday<br/>
10/09/01 and they were the most amazing group of<br/>
people.  We were there for 6 1/2 hrs.  They showed me<br/>
what to do and watch for so I can do therapy at home<br/>
everyday instead of driving over an hour there and<br/>
back everyday.  I only have to take her to see the<br/>
Drs. once a month in Galveston and they will come get<br/>
us the night before and take us back the day after and<br/>
pay for everything hotel and all.  It was such a<br/>
blessing for them to accept her and do all of this. <br/>
Deven and I were starting to get a little worried<br/>
about all of it because we've been paying $800-$1000 a<br/>
month on co-pays, gas, food, meds and lotions. <br/>
Shriners pays for everything.  I'm not gonna know what<br/>
to do with all the time I'm going to have.  Yeah I do,<br/>
spend it all with my babies!!!!  Deven and I feel like<br/>
a ton of bricks have been lifted off our shoulders.  I<br/>
know it was everyones thoughts and prayers. Thank you<br/>
so much.  I do have one more prayer to ask and that is<br/>
will you please pray (if your not already) that Deven<br/>
and I don't feel so much anger towards GOD.  We are<br/>
both having such mixed feeling right now.  I thank GOD<br/>
everyday that she is here and she's doing so well, but<br/>
five min. later I'm so angery at him I just want to<br/>
scream. I guess it's normal to feel this way but it<br/>
sure hurts to have this kind of anger built up inside<br/>
and I know it hurts him(GOD)as well. Thanks again,<br/>

Just wanted to let everyone know how Delaney is doing.<br/>
 She is walking and into everything, she has turned<br/>
into a very strong willed little girl.  Totally<br/>
different than the other two.  She is a little bundle<br/>
of joy.  Her scars are starting to heal, there are<br/>
some  areas that are still pretty thick and red but<br/>
the doctors at Shriners said when we go back in three<br/>
months they should be almost healed.  They really give<br/>
us so much hope for our darling.  We actually look<br/>
forward to her visits.  There is so much they already<br/>
have planned to do for her.  As soon as the scars are<br/>
healed (not red) they will be able to go in and remove<br/>
the thick ones.  One of the nipples still have not<br/>
come through.  They said something is there, either a<br/>
breast bud or the nipple.  If it is the bud and the<br/>
nipple is gone they said they will be able to tattoo<br/>
an areola on and put a nipple on.  You won't be able<br/>
to tell the difference.  They said the thickness of<br/>
the fingers and the amputated ones will slinder down<br/>
to almost normal.  The coloring of the grafted areas<br/>
are pretty much the normal color of her skin. You can<br/>
still tell she's been burned, but if you see her from<br/>
a distance it's not the first thing you see.  She is<br/>
still itching a lot.  We try just about everything but<br/>
sometimes it does no good.  That does get hard. <br/>
Shriners did tell us on our last visit (Feb.12) that<br/>
she doesn't have to wear her pressure garments<br/>
anymore.  They said it is just so hard on her beca use<br/>
she hates them so much and I'll be able to massage her<br/>
so much more that we could do without.  We were really<br/>
happy to hear that.  She would cry when I put it on<br/>
and I'd still cry putting it on.  Things will start<br/>
getting better now, I know they will.  I again want to<br/>
thank everyone for continuing the prayers and cards<br/>
for her.  I keep them all in a big box.  I can't wait<br/>
for her to understand how many people were praying for<br/>
her. She now tells everyone hi! wherever we go.  It's<br/>
really cute.  Also if she's wearing a shirt that she<br/>
can lift up, she will flash you.  We can't get out of<br/>
the stores without her flashing someone and then of<br/>
coarse I have to explain what happened to them.  I<br/>
definitely don't discourage her from doing that. <br/>
She's acts like she's proud of her boo boos and wants<br/>
to show them off.  Her sister and brother are doing<br/>
really well.  They still talk about the day it<br/>
happened, but you can tell they're forgetting little<br/>
bits at a time.  They love to explain to other kids<br/>
about what happened and what Shriners are going to do<br/>
for their little sister.  They go into such detail<br/>
explaining, that the little kids look at them like why<br/>
did I even ask?  It's pretty neat.  I just let them<br/>
say whatever their little hearts desire.  Well I'll<br/>
update again soon.  Thanks for wanting to be kept<br/>
updated on her.  If anyone doesn't want to be sent<br/>
these letters please let me know.  I just send the<br/>
e-mail to everyone on our list from when we were at<br/>
the hospital.  Thanks again.<br/>
Deana and Deven
