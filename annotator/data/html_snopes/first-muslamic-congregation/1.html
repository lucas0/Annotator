<!--<h3>Message from the Chaplain<br />
		<span class="subheading"><a href="/chaplaincy/index.html">The Reverend Patrick J. Conroy</a></span></h3>
		
        <p><img src="/images/coughlin_sm.jpg" alt="Photograph of The Reverend Patrick J. Conroy" />To serve as Chaplain for the U.S. House of Representatives is truly an honor and a privilege. To be both a minister of the Lord and an officer serving the United States government responds to a twofold call to serve others and offer prayer that unites Heaven and Earth.</p>
	  <p>With 435 Members in the House and their staffs, plus all the other wonderful people who serve here with committee work or in the Chamber, including teenage Pages, my pastoral duties  are many and varied. My goal is to meet the needs of this working community on a personal level. The problems that weigh on  hearts and the confusion that at times blocks  clarity of thinking become my concerns.</p>
	  <p>The formal prayer before each legislative session of Congress, and even before  days of <em>pro forma</em> sessions, casts a light on the day that awakens faith and calls forth a nation to stand with its leaders and affirm: &ldquo;In God We Trust.&rdquo; But daily prayer for the Members of the House cannot end there.</p>
	  <p>I ask people across this great country to join me in praying for the Members of the House of Representatives. Know the Member of your congressional district by name and raise his or her name before God each day with us here in the nation&rsquo;s capital.</p>
		<p>Pray for me, also, that I may be always rooted in prayer and  a good instrument for accomplishing God&rsquo;s holy will here. Only by being free in the Spirit can I serve all the people here, regardless of their faith persuasion or denomination. Only by listening attentively to each person can I offer good counsel, encouragement, and gentle correction.</p>
	  <p>Thank you for your interest in and support of the Members of the House. </p> -->

<h3>06/19/2019<br/><a href="https://chaplain.house.gov/chaplaincy/display_gc.html?id=2930"> Pastor Ryan Hodges</a></h3><p>Dear Heavenly Father, in Jesus' name, I want to thank You for today. Thank You for salvation.<br/> <br/>The Bible says, in 1 Timothy 2:1–2: "I exhort therefore, that, first of all, supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks be <br/>made for all men; for kings and for all that are in authority; that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty."<br/> <br/>Thank You for the Members of this House, the men and women of this Congress, and for their families. I pray for their work, their wisdom, <br/>and their walk.<br/> <br/>I pray that You would forgive us our sins as individuals and as a nation. I am truly grateful that Jesus said: "...and him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out."<br/> <br/>Please help us to glorify You this day with our lives. Thank You for America.<br/> <br/>In Jesus' name, amen.</p>
