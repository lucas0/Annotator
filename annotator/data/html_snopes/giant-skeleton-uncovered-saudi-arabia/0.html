The people of 'Ad lived many years in the windswept hills of an area between 
Yemen and Oman. They were physically well built and renowned for their 
craftsmanship especially in the construction of tall buildings with lofty 
towers. They were outstanding among all the nations in power and wealth, which, 
unfortunately, made them arrogant and boastful. Their political power was held 
in the hand of unjust rulers, against whom no one dared to raise a voice.</font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin:10px 15px; text-indent: 25px; ">
<font face="Verdana">
They were not ignorant of the existence of Allah, nor did they refuse to worship 
Him. What they did refuse was to worship Allah alone. They worshipped other 
gods, also, including idols. This is one sin Allah does not forgive.</font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin:10px 15px; text-indent: 25px; ">
<font face="Verdana">
Allah wanted to guide and discipline these people so He sent a prophet from 
among them. This prophet was Hud (PBUH), a noble man who handled this task with 
great resoluteness and tolerance.</font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin:10px 15px; text-indent: 25px; ">
<font face="Verdana">
Ibn Jarir reported that he was Hud Ibn Shalikh, Ibn Arfakhshand, Ibn Sam, Ibn 
Nuh (PBUH). He also reported that Prophet Hud (PBUH) was from a tribe called Ad 
Ibn Us Ibn Sam Ibn Nuh, who were Arabs living in Al Ahqaf in Yemen between Oman 
and Hadramaut, on a land called Ashar stretching out into the sea. The name of 
their valley was Mughiith</font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin:10px 15px; text-indent: 25px; ">
<font face="Verdana">
Some traditions claimed that Hud (PBUH) was the first person who spoke Arabic 
while others claimed that Nuh (PBUH) was the first. It was also said that Adam 
was the first.</font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin:10px 15px; text-indent: 25px; ">
<font face="Verdana">
Hud (PBUH) condemned idol worship and admonished his people. "MY people, what is 
the benefit of these stones that you carve with your own hands and worship? In 
reality it is an insult to the intellect. There is only One Deity worthy of 
worship and that is Allah. Worship of Him and Him alone, is compulsory on you.</font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin:10px 15px; text-indent: 25px; ">
<font face="Verdana">
He created you, He provides for you and He is the One Who will cause you to die. 
He gave you wonderful physiques and blessed you in many ways. So believe in Him 
and do not be blind to His favors, or the same fate that destroyed Noah's people 
will overtake you."</font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin:10px 15px; text-indent: 25px; ">
<font face="Verdana">
With such reasoning Hud hoped to instill faith in them, but they refused to 
accept his message. His people asked him: "Do you desire to be our master with 
your call? What payment do you want?"</font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin:10px 15px; text-indent: 25px; ">
<font face="Verdana">
Hud tried to make them understand that he would receive his payment (reward) 
from Allah; he did not demand anything from them except that they let the light 
of truth touch their minds and hearts.</font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin:10px 15px; text-indent: 25px; ">
<font face="Verdana">
Allah the Almighty states:<font color="#FF0000"> And to Ad people We sent 
their brother Hud. He said: "O my people! Worship Allah! You have no other Ilah 
(god) but Him; Certainly, you do nothing but invent (lies)! O my people I ask of 
you no reward for it (the Message). My reward is only from Him Who created me. 
Will you not then understand? And O my people! Ask forgiveness of your Lord and 
then repent to Him, He will send you (from the sky) abundant rain, and add 
strength to your strength, so do not turn away as Mujrimeen (criminals, 
disbeliveers in the Oneness of Allah)."</font></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin:10px 15px; text-indent: 25px; ">
<font color="#FF0000" face="Verdana">
They said: "O Hud! No evidence have you brought us and we shall not leave our 
gods for your mere saying! We are not believers in you. All that we say is that 
some of our gods (false deities) have seized you with evil (madness)."</font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin:10px 15px; text-indent: 25px; ">
<font color="#FF0000" face="Verdana">
HE said: "I call Allah to witness and bear you witness that I am free from that 
which you ascribe as partners in worship, and with Him (Allah). SO plot against 
me, all of you, and give me no respite. I put my trust in Allah, my Lord and 
your Lord! There is not a moving (living) creature but HE has grasp of its 
forelock. Verily, my Lord is on the Straight Path (the truth). SO if you turn 
away, still I have conveyed the Message with which I was sent to you. My Lord 
will make another people succeed you, and you will not harm Him in the least. 
Surely, my Lord is Guardian over all things." ( 
11:50-57 Quran)</font></p>

Hud tried to speak to them and to explain about Allah's blessings: how Allah the 
Almighty had made them Noah's successors, how He had given them strength and 
power, and how HE sent them rain to revive the soil.</font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin:10px 15px; text-indent: 25px; ">
<font face="Verdana">
Hud's people looked about them and found they were the strongest on earth, so 
they become prouder and more obstinate. Thus they argued a lot with Hud. They 
asked "O Hud! Do you say that later we die and turn into dust, we will be 
resurrected?" He replied, "Yes, you will come back on the Day of Judgment and 
each of you will be asked about what you did."</font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin:10px 15px; text-indent: 25px; ">
<font face="Verdana">A 
peal of laughter was heard after the last statement. "How strange Hud's claims 
are!" The disbeliveers muttered among themselves. They believed that when man 
dies his body decays and turns into dust, which is swept away by the wind. How 
could that return to its original state? Then what is the significance of the 
Day of Judgment? Why does the dead return to life?</font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin:10px 15px; text-indent: 25px; ">
<font face="Verdana">
All these questions were patiently received by Hud. He then addressed his people 
concerning the Day of Judgment. he explained that belief in the Day of Judgment 
is essential to Allah's justice, teaching them the same thing that every prophet 
taught about it.</font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin:10px 15px; text-indent: 25px; ">
<font face="Verdana">
Hud explained that justice demands that there be a Day of Judgment because good 
is not always victorious in life. Sometimes evil overpowers good. Will such 
crimes go unpunished? If we suppose there is no Day of Judgment, then a great 
injustice will have prevailed, but Allah has forbidden injustice to be incurred 
by Himself or His subjects. Therefore, the existence of the Day of Judgment, a 
day of accounting for our deeds and being rewarded or punished for them, reveals 
the extend of Allah's justice. Hud spoke to them about all of these things. They 
listened but disbelieved him.</font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin:10px 15px; text-indent: 25px; ">
<font face="Verdana">
Allah recounts his people's attitude towards the Day of Judgment:
<font color="#FF0000">"The chiefs of his people, whom disbelieved and denied the meeting in the 
Hereafter, and to who We had given the luxuries and comforts of this life, said: 
"He is no more than a human being like you, he eats of that which you eat, and 
drinks of what you drink. If you were to obey a human being like yourselves then 
verily! You indeed would be losers. Does he promise you that when you have died 
and have become dust and bones, you shall come out alive (resurrected)? Far, 
very far, is that which you are promised. There is nothing but our life of this 
world! We die and we live! We are not going to be resurrected! He is only a man 
who has invented a lie against Allah, but we are not going to believe in him." 
(23:33-38 Quran)</font></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px; margin: 10px 15px">
<font face="Verdana">  the chiefs of Hud's people asked: "IS it 
not strange that Allah's chooses one of us to reveal His message to?"</font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin:10px 15px; text-indent: 25px; ">
<font face="Verdana">
Hud replied: "What is strange in that? Allah wants to guide you to the right way 
of life, so HE sent me to warn you. Noah's flood and his story are not far away 
from you, so do not forget what happened. All the disbeliveers were destroyed, 
no matter how strong they were."</font></p>
<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px; margin: 10px 15px">
<font face="Verdana">  "Who is going to destroy us Hud?" the 
chiefs asked.</font></p>
<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px; margin: 10px 15px">
<font face="Verdana">  "Allah." replied Hud.</font></p>
<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px; margin: 10px 15px">
<font face="Verdana">  The disbeliveers among his people 
answered: "We will be saved by our gods."</font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin:10px 15px; text-indent: 25px; ">
<font face="Verdana">
Hud clarified to them that the gods they worshipped would be the reason for 
their destruction, that it is Allah alone Who saves people, and that no other 
power on earth can benefit or harm anyone.</font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin:10px 15px; text-indent: 25px; ">
<font face="Verdana">
The conflict between Hud and his people continued. The years passed, and they 
became prouder and more obstinate, and more tyrannical and more defiant of their 
prophet's message.</font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin:10px 15px; text-indent: 25px; ">
<font face="Verdana">
Furthermore, they started to accuse Hud (PBUH) of being a crazy lunatic. One day 
they told him: "We now understand the secret of your madness you insulted our 
gods and they harmed you; that is why you have become insane."</font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin:10px 15px; text-indent: 25px; ">
<font face="Verdana">
Almighty Allah repeated their words in the Quran:<font color="#FF0000"> "O my Hud! No evidence have 
you brought us, and we shall not leave our gods for your mere saying! And we are 
not believers in you. All that we say is that some of our gods (false deities) 
have seized you with evil (madness)." (11:53-54 Quran)</font></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin:10px 15px; text-indent: 25px; ">
<font face="Verdana">
Hud had to return their challenge. He had no other way but to turn to Allah 
alone, no other alternative but to give them a threatening ultimatum. he 
declared to them:<font color="#FF0000"> "I call Allah to witness and bear you witness that I am 
free from that which you ascribe as pin worship with Him (Allah). SO plot 
against me, all of you and give me no respite. I put my trust in Allah, my Lord 
your Lord! There is not a moving (living) creature but He has grasp of its 
forelock. Verily, my Lord is on the Straight Path (the truth). So if you turn 
away, still I have conveyed the message with which it was sent to you. My Lord 
will make another people succeed you, and you will not harm Him." (11:54-57 Quran)</font></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin:10px 15px; text-indent: 25px; ">
<font face="Verdana">
Thus Hud renounced them and their gods and affirmed his dependence on Allah Who 
had created him. Hud realized that punishment would be incurred on the 
disbeliveers among his people. It is one of the laws of life. Allah punishes the 
disbeliveers, no matter how rich, tyrannical or great they are.</font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin:10px 15px; text-indent: 25px; ">
<font face="Verdana">
Hud and his people waited for Allah's promise. A drought spread throughout the 
land, for the sky no longer sent its rain. the sun scorched the desert sands, 
looking like a disk of fire which settled on people's heads.</font></p>
<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 25px; margin: 10px 15px">
<font face="Verdana">Hud's people hastened to him asking: "What is 
that drought Hud?"</font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin:10px 15px; text-indent: 25px; ">
<font face="Verdana">
Hud answered: "Allah is angry with you. If you believe in Him, He will accept 
you and the rain will fall and you will become stronger than you are."</font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin:10px 15px; text-indent: 25px; ">
<font face="Verdana">
They mocked him and became more obstinate, sarcastic and preserve in their 
unbelief. The drought increased, the trees turned yellow, and plants died.</font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin:10px 15px; text-indent: 25px; ">
<font face="Verdana">
A day came when they found the sky full of clouds. Hud's people were glad as 
they came out of their tents crying: "A cloud, which will give us rain!"</font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin:10px 15px; text-indent: 25px; ">
<font face="Verdana">
The weather changed suddenly from burning dry and hot to stinging cold with wind 
that shook everything; trees, plants, tents, men and women. The wind increased 
day after day and night after night.</font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin:10px 15px; text-indent: 25px; ">
<font face="Verdana">
Hud's people started to flee. They ran to their tents to hide but the gale 
became stronger, ripping their tents from their stakes. They hid under cloth 
covers but the gale became stronger and still and tore away the covers. It 
slashed clothing and skin. It penetrated the apertures of the body and destroyed 
it. It hardly touched anything before it was destroyed or killed, its core 
sucked out to decompose and rot. The storm raged for 8 days and 7 nights.</font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin:10px 15px; text-indent: 25px; ">
<font face="Verdana">
Almighty Allah recounts:<font color="#FF0000"> Then when they saw it as a dense cloud coming 
towards their valleys, they said: "This is a cloud bringing us rain!" Nay but it 
is that torment which you were asking to be hastened! a wind wherein is a 
painful torment! Destroying everything by the command of its Lord! (46:24-25 Quran)</font></font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin:10px 15px; text-indent: 25px; ">
<font face="Verdana">
Allah the Exalted described it thus:<i> And as for Ad, they were destroyed for a 
firious violent wind which Allah imposed on them for 7 nights and 8 days in 
succession, so that you could see men lying overthrown (destroyed) as if they 
were hollow trunks of palm trees!</i> (Ch 69:6-7 Quran)</font></p>
<p align="justify" style="margin:10px 15px; text-indent: 25px; ">
<font face="Verdana">
That violent gale did not stop until the entire region was reduced to ruins and 
its wicked people destroyed, swallowed by the sands of the desert. Only Hud and 
his followers remained unharmed. They migrated to Hadramaut and lived there in 
peace, worshipping Allah, their true Lord.<br/>
