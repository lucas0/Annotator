              Neil Marshall </font></h1>
<p> I have found that a lot of humans like to trust in emotion and 
              superstition rather than logic and common sense. This is not necessarily 
              a bad thing but sometimes our imaginations seem to leep high above 
              what is truly the case. </p>
<p> I will try and present the information in the most objective way 
              possible. </p>
<p> A little Background on Nostradamus: </p>
<p> Michel de Nostredame, better known as Nostradamus, was a famous 
              astrologer who lived in the 16th century. He made many prophecies, 
              both for his current era and the distant future. Most famous are 
              his Centuries, a series of 942 verses, grouped in sets of 100, describing 
              future events. A single verse is commonly called a quatrain and 
              100 quatrains a Centurie. </p>
<p> His writings were in French and according to the "Scholar's Nostradamus" 
              (whether they are true scholars is a question that I will not answer), 
              they were written in code to prevent his persecution during the 
              Inquisition. </p>
<p> Some Interpretations of his writings seem to indicate that he 
              had amazing powers that allowed him to see into the future. </p>
<p> Here below is a sample (Century II, Quatrain 5) </p>
<p> Origional French: </p>
<p> Qu'en dans poisson, fer &amp; lettre enfermee, Hors sortira, qui 
              puis fera la guerre, Aura par mer sa classe bien ramee, Apparoissant 
              pres de Latine terre. </p>
<p> En Anglais si vous plais (an interpretation/translation) </p>
<p> That which is enclosed in iron and letter in a fish, Out will 
              go one who will then make war, He will have his fleet well rowed 
              by sea, Appearing near Latin land. </p>
<p> Some people believe that this quatrain seems to indicate that 
              Nostradamus knew there would be submarines and metal warships in 
              the future. </p>
<p> <a href="http://www.sas.upenn.edu/~smfriedm/nostradamus.html">This 
              is from the In Defense of Nostradamus Web Page:</a> </p>
<p> In Century 9 Quatrain 16, Nostradamus, who lived in the mid 16th 
              century, wrote: </p>
<p> Original French De castel Franco sortira l'assemblee, L'ambassadeur 
              non plaisant fera scisme: Ceux de Ribiere seront en la meslee, Et 
              au grand goulfre desnie ont l'entree. </p>
<p> English Translation Out of Castille, Franco will leave the assembly, 
              The ambassador will not agree and cause a schism: The followers 
              of Rivera will be in the crowd, And they will refuse entry to the 
              great gulf. </p>
<p> Here Nostradamus tells us that in Spain -- usings its traditional 
              name "Castilla" -- there will be a fight between Franco and Rivera. 
              Francisco Franco and Primo de Rivera happened to have been the two 
              main opposing leaders during the Spanish Civil War of 1933. Let 
              that fact speak for itself. </p>
<p> Further more every so often there is some sort of Nostradamus 
              Special on TV in which the producer's "ahem-prove" that Nostradamus 
              had some sort of magical power that allows him to predict The French 
              Revolution, the World Wars, the End of the World and all kinds of 
              things. </p>
<p> That seems pretty amazing. He must be some kind of magical happy 
              super being. </p>
<p> My Opinion: </p>
<p> What these shows usually forget to tell you (until the credits 
              are rolling at the end (when nobody is watching)) is that these 
              are INTERPRETATIONS of Nostradamus' writing. Of course if they made 
              a big deal about that and included a proper logical analysis of 
              the Quatrains (using the Scientific Method) they would probably 
              loose ratings since a lot of people seem to enjoy believing that 
              there are supernatural forces always at work in the Universe which 
              science cannot explain. Wether that is true is a great philosophical 
              question, however the point is that when Nostradamus' writing's 
              are put to the test (scientifically analysed), it shows that he 
              really isn't as much as he has been built up to be. </p>
<p> At this point I would like to introduce to you what I call the 
              "Infinite Monkey's Principle." Let's say that I have aquired an 
              infinite amount of monkeys and an infinite amount of typewritters 
              or word processors (It doesn't matter). Of course, as far as we 
              know that is impossible to do (Unless you buy factory direct from 
              me--send 500 trillion dollars to me (gold bullion only, liquid assets 
              are not negotiable) But I digress... If these Infinite Amount of 
              Monkeys are allowed to bang out whatever they want on the infinite 
              typewriter, one of them will produce the complete works of Shakespear. 
            </p>
<p> How? Simple if the Monkey's write random garbage but in an infinite 
              amount, eventually because of the simple fact that it is inevitable 
              (simple probability thought shows this). </p>
<p> How does this apply to Nostradamus? Well I will show you... </p>
<p> If I make say a thousand prophecies that are fairly abstract for 
              example: </p>
<p> In the City of God there will be a great thunder, Two brothers 
              torn apart by Chaos, while the fortress endures, the great leader 
              will succumb </p>
<p> Well let us analyse this. For Example what does City of God mean? 
              It could be Mecca, Medina, Rome, Jeruselum, Salt Lake City, or any 
              holy city depending on your religion. What do I mean by thunder--a 
              storm? War? EarthQuake? lots of stuff can be described by thunder. 
              There are a lot of two brothers on this world (I think the Number 
              runs among the Billions) and fortress edure's what--Besiegement, 
              Famine, etc? What Great Leader? How will he succumb? To what? </p>
<p> Now let the prophecy rest for a few years. Add a couple thousand 
              more. Eventually, one of them will fit close enought with events 
              that have happened in the future that the prophecy will appear to 
              come true. If you make enough prophecies and are intelligent enough 
              to word them in such a way that they are abstract you become instant 
              future see-er person. For example those psychics you see every year 
              that make predictions for the year 199-whatever generally get one 
              or two out of ten predictions right. It is because they are good 
              guessers and that there is enough of them to make it seem like people 
              can really predict the future. </p>
<p> I am not discounting the possibility of a sixth sense nor of the 
              supernatural but I would like to state that there is no scientifically 
              proven Psychic person in the world. Ever psychic that says that 
              she or he is a psychic and has been put to the test has failed quite 
              miserably. It is true. There is no discounting that fact. </p>
<p> Further more, the Scholar's of Nostradomas seem to be taking further 
              and further leaps in logic when they interpret his writings. For 
              example this is a link to a page in which a person claims that Nostredomus 
              prophesised the breakup of Canada. Click <a href="http://www.infobahnos.com/~ledash/quebec_prophecy.html">here</a> to judge 
              for yourself. </p>
<p> Further more I was watching a 1970's movie on Nostredamus and 
              it predicted that the Third World War began in 1994 and was well 
              on it's way by 1999. (I am holding my breath. Oh no!). The people 
              who "analyse" the Quatrains simply scan through history until they 
              find an event that seems to fit with the quatrain. </p>
            Perhaps Nostredamus was a futurist. I do not know. Perhaps he suffered 
            some sort of mental illness (hardly unusual in 16th century Europe). 
            Maybe he just had nothing better to do with his time. I do not think 
            though that, faced with the evidence that science has shown, he was 
            a true Psychic who could see the future. Call me a skeptic but I believe 
            the "Phrase Innocent Until Proven otherwise" should be used to regulate 
            any phenomena in Nature. (In this case it would be Scientifically 
            Explainable unless shown otherwise. Or in the Case of Psychics you 
            are not a Psychic unless you can prove beyond reasonable doubt that 
            you have these "powers") 
            <p> That is all. </p>
