NSC 5520 "Draft Statement of Policy on U.S. Scientific
Satellite Program," recommended the creation of a
scientific satellite program as part of the International
Geophysical Year as well as the development of satellites for
reconnaissance purposes.  Based upon this report, the National
Security Council approved the IGY satellite on May 26, 1955. 
However, it was not until July 28 that a public announcement was
made during an oral briefing at the White House.  The formal
statement was dated July
29.  This
statement emphasized that the satellite program was intended to be
the U.S. contribution to the IGY and that the scientific data was
to benefit scientists of all nations.
