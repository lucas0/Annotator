Properties, Analytical Methods</h3><p class="p p-first-last" id="P1">A compendium is provided of aluminium compounds used in industrial settings, and as pharmaceuticals, food additives, cosmetics and as other household products. Most aluminium compounds are solids exhibiting high melting points. The solubility of aluminium salts is governed by pH, because the aluminium(III)-cation (Al<sup>3+</sup>) has a strong affinity for the hydroxide ion, which promotes precipitation. Like Mg<sup>2+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions, Al<sup>3+</sup> in most situations seeks out complexing agents with oxygen-atom donor sites such as carboxylate and phosphate groups, including in biological systems. Aluminium oxides, hydroxides and oxyhydroxides occur in numerous crystallographic forms, which exhibit different surface properties. Few compounds of aluminium are classified in Annex 1 of the European Economic Union Council (EEC) Directive 67/1548, with aluminium powder and sodium aluminium fluoride (cryolite) as examples of exceptions, as well as compounds in which the anion renders them reactive such as aluminium phosphide. And finally, the more recent analytical methods available for the study of chemical speciation in solids and solution, and for quantitative analysis, have been applied to the determination of aluminium and the identification of its various forms.</p></div><div class="sec" id="S3"><h3 id="S3title">Sources of Human Exposure</h3><p class="p p-first" id="P2">Aluminium and its compounds comprise about 8% of the Earth’s surface; aluminium occurs naturally in silicates, cryolite, and bauxite rock. Natural processes account for most of the redistribution of aluminium in the environment. Acidic precipitation mobilizes aluminium from natural sources, and direct anthropogenic releases of aluminium compounds associated with industrial processes occur mainly to air. Certain uses lead to the presence of aluminium in drinking water and foodstuffs.</p><p id="P3">Bauxite is the most important raw material used in the production of aluminium. Bauxite is refined to produce alumina from which aluminium metal is recovered by electrolytic reduction; aluminium is also recycled from scrap. Aluminium hydroxide is produced from bauxite. In 2004, primary aluminium was being produced in 41 countries, the largest producers being China, Russia, Canada and the United States. In that year, worldwide production of primary aluminium, alumina and aluminium hydroxide reached about 30, 63, and 5 million tonnes per annum, respectively. More than 7 million tonnes of aluminium is recovered annually from recycled old scrap.</p><p id="P4">The largest markets for aluminium metal and its alloys are in transportation, building and construction, packaging and in electrical equipment. Transportation uses are one of the fastest growing areas for aluminium use. Aluminium powders are used in pigments and paints, fuel additives, explosives and propellants. Aluminium oxides are used as food additives and in the manufacture of, for example, abrasives, refractories, ceramics, electrical insulators, catalysts, paper, spark plugs, light bulbs, artificial gems, alloys, glass and heat resistant fibres. Aluminium hydroxide is used widely in pharmaceutical and personal care products. Food related uses of aluminium compounds include preservatives, fillers, colouring agents, anti-caking agents, emulsifiers and baking powders; soy-based infant formula can contain aluminium. Natural aluminium minerals especially bentonite and zeolite are used in water purification, sugar refining, brewing and paper industries.</p><p class="p p-last" id="P5">Aluminium has not been classified with respect to carcinogenicity; however, “aluminium production” has been classified as carcinogenic to humans by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) (for further explanation, please see <em>Effects on Humans, Effects from Occupational Exposure, Cancer</em>). Occupational limits exist in several countries for exposures to aluminium dust and aluminium oxide. For non-occupational environments, limits have been set for intake in foods and drinking water; the latter are based on aesthetic or practical, rather than health, considerations.</p></div><div class="sec" id="S4"><h3 id="S4title">Environmental Levels and Human Exposure</h3><p class="p p-first" id="P6">Aluminium may be designated as crustal in origin, and thus surface soils at uncontaminated sites constitute a source of soluble aluminium species in surface water and aluminium-containing particulates in sediments and ambient-air aerosols. Not surprisingly, the latter are present extensively in air samples in agricultural communities and when road dust is extensive. Environmental acidification is known to mobilize aluminium from land to aquatic environments. Interestingly, aluminium levels and its various forms (species) are often similar in source water and after its treatment with potassium alum as a flocculent during drinking water purification.</p><p class="p p-last" id="P7">Workers in the aluminium production and user industries, as well as aluminium welders, experience considerable exposures to the metal and/or its compounds. In absence of occupational exposures and chronic use of aluminium-containing antacids and buffered aspirin, food is the major intake source of aluminium, followed by drinking water. When considering bioavailability, namely the fraction that is actually taken up into the blood stream, food is again the primary uptake source for individuals not occupationally exposed. However, chronic use of antacids, buffered aspirins and other medical preparations would likely constitute the major uptake source, even when exposed at work.</p></div><div class="sec" id="S5"><h3 id="S5title">Kinetics and Metabolism</h3><div class="sec sec-first" id="S6"><p></p><h4 class="inline" id="S6title">Humans </h4><p class="p p-first" id="P8">The use of <sup>26</sup>Al as a tracer and accelerator mass spectrometry has enabled safe studies of aluminium toxicokinetics with real exposure-relevant doses in humans. Aluminium bioavailability from occupational inhalation exposure is ~ 2% whereas oral aluminium bioavailability from water has been reported to be 0.1 to 0.4%. Oral aluminium bioavailability is increased by citrate, acidic pH, and uraemia and may be decreased by silicon-containing compounds. Oral aluminium bioavailability is also inversely related to iron status.</p><p id="P9">Oral aluminium bioavailability is greater from water than from aluminium hydroxide or sucralfate. Oral aluminium bioavailability from aluminium hydroxide is ≤ 0.1%, and is less with higher doses. Increased oral aluminium absorption has been suggested in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and Down’s subjects. Oral aluminium bioavailability from the diet has been estimated to be ~ 0.1 to 0.3%, based on daily aluminium intake and urinary elimination. Results of a few studies with a controlled diet and tea are consistent with this estimate.</p><p id="P10">Steady state serum to whole blood aluminium concentrations are ~ equal. Slightly &gt; 90% of plasma aluminium is associated with transferrin (Tf), ~ 7 to 8% with citrate, and &lt; 1% with phosphate and hydroxide. Normal plasma aluminium concentration is believed to be 1 to 2 μg/L. Normal tissue aluminium concentrations are greater in lung (due to entrapment of particles from the environment) than bone than soft tissues. Approximately 60, 25, 10, 3 and 1% of the aluminium body burden is in the bone, lung, muscle, liver and brain, respectively. Higher concentrations are seen in uraemia and higher still in dialysis encephalopathy.</p><p id="P11">Tissue aluminium concentration increases with age. Some studies have reported that the aluminium concentration in the bulk brain samples, neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) and plaques was higher in AD subjects than controls. Other studies have found no difference. Hair aluminium concentration has been described but its value as an indicator of aluminium body burden has not been demonstrated.</p><p id="P12">Greater than 95% of aluminium is eliminated by the kidney; ~ 2% in bile. Occupational aluminium exposure increases urinary more than plasma aluminium concentration above their normal levels. Depending on the type and route of exposure, aluminium clearance has been characterized as having multiple half-times and are estimated in hours, days, and years. Most of the Al was eliminated within the first week; the terminal half-life probably represents &lt; 1% of the injected aluminium.</p><p id="P13">Biological monitoring of human aluminium exposure has been conducted with urine, which is thought to indicate recent exposure, and plasma, which is thought to better reflect the aluminium body burden and long-term exposure. However, neither is a very good predictor of the aluminium body burden, which is better estimated by bone aluminium, the desferrioxamine challenge test, or combined measurement of serum iPTH (parathyroid hormone) and the desferrioxamine test.</p><p class="p p-last" id="P14">Serum aluminium &gt; 30 μg/L in dialysis patients has been associated with osteomalacia and related disorders and &gt; 80 μg/L associated with encephalopathy. Up to 5 mg/kg of desferrioxamine once or twice weekly has been shown to be safe and effective for long-term treatment of aluminium overload.</p></div><div class="sec sec-last" id="S7"><p></p><h4 class="inline" id="S7title">Animals </h4><p class="p p-first" id="P15">In studies of animals, pulmonary deposition of fly ash was 2 to 12% and was inversely related to particle size. Oral aluminium bioavailability from water appears to be ~ 0.3%. The very limited data available suggest oral aluminium bioavailability from food is less than from water.</p><p id="P16">Oral aluminium bioavailability is increased by citrate, and to a lesser extent, other carboxylic acids, increased solubility of the aluminium species, acidic pH, uraemia, increased dose of soluble aluminium species, and perhaps fluoride. Oral aluminium bioavailability is decreased by silicon-containing compounds. Oral aluminium bioavailability is also inversely related to iron, calcium and sodium status.</p><p id="P17">Absorption of aluminium from the gastrointestinal tract (GI) appears to be primarily in the distal intestine. There is evidence supporting several mechanisms of intestinal aluminium absorption, including sodium transport processes, an interaction with calcium uptake, and paracellular diffusion. Aluminium penetration of the skin is very shallow. Aluminium may be able to enter the brain from the nasal cavity by a direct route, bypassing systemic circulation, but convincing evidence is lacking. Absorption of aluminium from intramuscularly (i.m.) injected aluminium hydroxide and aluminiun phosphate adjuvants is significant, and may eventually be complete. Tissue aluminium concentration increases with age.</p><p id="P18">The volume of distribution (V<sub>d</sub>) of aluminium is initially consistent with the blood volume, and then increases with time. Steady state serum to whole blood aluminium concentrations are ~ equal. Greater than 90% of serum aluminium is bound to Tf. Although aluminium has been reported in many intracellular compartments, concentrations were often greater in the nucleus. Ferritin can incorporate aluminium.</p><p id="P19">Following i.v. injection, ~ 0.001 to 0.01% of the aluminium dose enters each gram of brain and ~ 100-fold more each gram of bone. Brain aluminium uptake across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) may be mediated by Tf-receptor mediated endocytosis (TfR-ME) and a Tf-independent mechanism that may transport aluminium citrate. There appears to be a transporter that effluxes aluminium from the brain into blood. Aluminium distributes into the placenta, foetus, milk, hair, and can be quantified in all tissues and fluids. Greater than 95% of aluminium is eliminated by the kidney, probably by glomerular filtration. Less than 2% appears in bile.</p><p id="P20">Aluminium clearance is characterized by multiple half-lives (<em>t<sub>½</sub></em>), suggesting multiple compartments. The terminal <em>t<sub>½</sub></em> from the lung is ~ 100 days and from the brain and other soft tissues &gt; 100 days. Prolonged aluminium residence in the bone may account for the prolonged <em>t<sub>½</sub></em> observed in most organs, including the brain.</p><p class="p p-last" id="P21">There are no published reports of physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modelling of aluminium. A few models have been developed that incorporate the reported results of toxicokinetic studies with aluminium.</p></div></div><div class="sec" id="S8"><h3 id="S8title">Effects on Laboratory Mammals and <em>In Vitro</em> Test Systems</h3><p class="p p-first" id="P22">Regardless of the duration of exposure, the toxicity attributed to aluminium is dependent upon the physiochemical properties (solubility, pH, bioavailability, etc.), type of aluminium preparation, route of administration, and physiological status (presence of renal dysfunction). Following oral exposure, aluminium distributes throughout the organism with accumulation in bone, kidneys and brain being of concern to humans with evidence of renal dysfunction, anemia or neurobehavioural alterations reported after excessive doses. The presence of aluminium in vaccines was found to be associated with macrophagic myofasciitis (MMF) at the site of i.m. injection. The toxicity of aluminium is affected by chelating agents and ligands although the mechanisms underlying toxicity remain unknown. However, it should be noted that only at excessive concentrations of aluminium are toxic manifestations seen and, hence aluminium is considered to possess a “low” potential for producing adverse effects.</p><p id="P23">Oral administration of aluminium did not affect reproductive capacity in males or females. Exposure to aluminium during gestation did not affect maternal health or development of the foetuses and neonates. Further, there was no evidence of teratogenic alterations in the foetuses of mothers fed dietary aluminium. Maternal dietary exposure to excessive amounts of aluminium during gestation and lactation resulted in neurobehavioural abnormalities in mouse offspring. At physiological concentrations the reproductive system does not appear to be a target for aluminium-induced effects; and if there is exposure during pregnancy, the growth and development of offspring of metal-treated mothers is not adversely affected.</p><p id="P24">The form of aluminium most often presented to tissues outside of the blood stream is expected to be bound to Tf. In brain, aluminium is prone to dissociate from Tf as a soluble citrate salt. Most cells of the central nervous system (CNS) express Tf receptor, and thus receptor-mediated uptake would be one mechanism by which aluminium could enter cells of the brain. Free flow endocytosis of aluminium citrate could be an alternative route of uptake. As outlined in <em>Effects on Laboratory Mammals and In Vitro Test Systems, Neurotoxicity, In Vivo Models, Neuropathology</em>, there is at least one example of human pathology which is consistent with this mode of tissue exposure. Choroid plexus epithelia, cortical glia, and cortical neurons of patients exhibiting dialysis associated encephalopathy (DAE) develop intracellular argentophylllic granules that are lysosome-derived and intracytoplasmic. Uptake of aluminium-Tf complexes via receptor-mediated endocytosis would be expected to produce just such pathology. Whether aluminium, of any amount or speciation, escapes these compartments to impact on intracellular processes in humans is unknown. If relatively high doses produce pathology of such a distinctive nature, then it is reasonable to presume that lower doses of aluminium would follow similar pathways into the nervous system of humans.</p><p id="P25">In the studies of animals, it is important to note that a few reports have documented a pathologic accumulation of aluminium in intracellular lysosome-derived structures. Aluminium accumulation in lysosome-like cytoplasmic granules of retinal neurons in rats exposed to very high doses of aluminium was reported (see <em>Effects on Laboratory Mammals and In Vitro Test Systems, Neurotoxicity, In Vivo Models, Rodent Models of Aluminium Toxicity by Direct Injection</em>). Severe atrophy of the retina and loss of photoreceptors was also noted. Similarly, another study noted intracellular accumulations of aluminium in the brain of rats feed diets high in aluminium. For CNS it seems likely that the mode of delivery to the tissue is through Tf-mediated uptake. From animal studies and the clear association of aluminium exposure and DAE, it is clear that high levels of aluminium in CNS can lead to neurotoxicity. From the current literature it remains difficult to assess what a concentration of aluminium in serum (chronic levels) correlates with neurotoxicity. The effects of aluminium on the developing nervous system have also not been thoroughly addressed.</p><p id="P26">In regards to mechanisms by which aluminium could play a role in AD, there are both direct and indirect modes of potential action. In a direct mode, aluminium could potentiate the aggregation of molecules known to form pathologic lesions in AD. There is evidence that aluminium can promote the aggregation of β-amyloid peptide <em>in vitro</em>. However, whether aluminium would dissociate from Tf at an appreciable rate and bind β-amyloid peptide <em>in vivo</em> is unclear. One study found no association between AD-like pathology and long-term ingestion of aluminium. Indeed in this study of older patients, the incidence of AD-associated pathology in patients with DAE was no different from controls. Although these studies would suggest that there is little direct evidence for an association between AD and aluminium, a study of transgenic mice that produce Alzheimer-type amyloid pathology noted that mice feed diets high in aluminium showed increased levels of amyloid (see <em>Effects on Laboratory Mammals and In Vitro Test Systems, Neurotoxicity, Alzheimer’s Disease</em>). Moreover, it is well established in the rabbit that exposure to aluminium induces the formation of filamentous structures containing cytoplasmic neurofilament protein (see <em>Effects on Laboratory Mammals and In Vitro Test Systems, Neurotoxicity, Motor Neuron Disease</em>). Therefore, it is difficult to determine how a life-time of exposure to aluminium might influence the development of Alzheimer-type pathology by affecting the folding or clearance of “at-risk” proteins such as β-amyloid, tau, and α-synuclein.</p><p id="P27">Apart from the potential that aluminium might interact directly with molecules implicated in AD and related neurodegenerative disorders, studies in animals have revealed potential mechanisms by which aluminium might indirectly impact on the function of the nervous system. In <em>Effects on Laboratory Mammals and In Vitro Test Systems, Neurotoxicity, Alzheimer’s Disease</em>, studies are described that reported aluminium may affect levels of cholesterol, which has been suggested in numerous studies as a potential modulator or Alzheimer-type amyloid formation. <em>Effects on Laboratory Mammals and In Vitro Test Systems, Neurotoxicity, In Vivo Models, Rodent Models of Aluminium Toxicity by Direct Injection</em> describes several studies that have reported elevated levels of markers of oxidative stress in animals exposed to aluminium. These studies suggest potential mechanisms by which long-term exposure to aluminium could be deleterious and could synergistically worsen cognitive abilities in individuals that have pathologic abnormalities associated with AD.</p><p id="P28">However, there has not been strong evidence from animal studies that aluminium directly modulates cognitive function. As described in <em>Effects on Laboratory Mammals and In Vitro Test Systems, Neurotoxicity,Behavioural Studies of Laboratory Animals Exposed to Aluminium</em>, there have been several studies that have examined the cognitive abilities of mice and rats exposed to aluminium. For the most part, these studies did not report profound cognitive impairment even when exposed to very high levels of aluminium. Therefore, it seems unlikely that aluminium might lower the threshold for AD by blunting cognitive ability of adults.</p><p id="P29">Outside of the nervous system, the data regarding the potential for alumimium to cause abnormalities is mixed. There is clear evidence that sustained exposure to high levels of aluminium can cause bone abnormalities. Aluminium is clearly deposited in bone at sites of new growth. Bones in animals exposed to aluminium may show increased weakness and increased brittleness. Deficiencies in calcium or magnesium may exacerbate the effects of aluminium. Aluminium overload leads to PTH suppression and with regards to the bone, may be associated with altered calcium homeostasis.</p><p id="P30">Aluminium may also have negative effects on hematopoiesis. However, these effects are relatively mild unless animals are deficient in iron. In this latter setting, there will be increased levels of free Tf, which can then bind aluminium and compete for Tf receptor; further limiting the amount of iron available for erythrogenesis. Aluminium may also interfere with the metabolism of other metals. On this latter point, the strongest data, meaning most reproducible, suggest that aluminium exposure can lead to increased excretion of phosphorous.</p><p id="P31">From the present data, however, it is difficult to determine what level of exposure poses a risk for human health or which systems are most vulnerable. Based on projections from studies in dogs, individuals with sustained aluminium levels in serum that are 10-fold higher than the average range, or 1-2 μg/L, may be at increased risk for bone abnormalities. The exposure levels at which other systems might be affected are more difficult to project, particularly when trying to assess risk for late-onset illnesses.</p><p id="P32">Although not reported in every study, the majority of studies that utilized high doses of aluminium reported significant reductions in weight gain, particularly in studies initiated in young animals. The physiologic basis for this outcome is unclear, but it was reported that animals exposed to high doses of aluminium in drinking water consumed less food. Whether general effects of aluminium on metabolic processes depress metabolism or reduce nutritional efficiency remains to be resolved.</p><p id="P33">Experimental aluminium inhalation has been shown to produce effects interpreted as alveolar proteinosis and lipid pneumonia. Inhalation of aluminium had some protective effect against quartz dust-induced fibrosis in some, but not all, studies. Intratracheal aluminium instillation produced nodular fibrosis. Aluminium is used as an adjuvant in vaccines and hyposensitization treatments to precipitate toxins and toxoids, enhance their antigenic properties and reduce their rate of absorption and elimination. Aluminium can produce aluminium-species-dependent dermal irritation.</p><p id="P34">Experimental animal studies have failed to demonstrate carcinogenicity attributed solely to aluminium compounds. Often the response reported is associated with a tissue response to a foreign body rather than a direct effect of aluminium exposure. This appeared to be consistent across various routes of exposure from inhalation to intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection.</p><p id="P35">In agreement with their non-carcinogenic activity, aluminium compounds failed to show positive results in most short-term mutagenic assays and animal experiments to determine genotoxic potential of aluminium compounds lead to contradictory results with suggestions of an anti-genotoxic potential.</p><p class="p p-last" id="P36">There is little reported for aluminium compounds in the way of immunotoxicity. There may be an altered immune response to challenge following excess aluminium exposure and this may be influenced by the health and hormonal status of the dam with increased susceptibility to bacterial infection seen in pregnancy.</p></div><div class="sec" id="S9"><h3 id="S9title">Effects on Humans</h3><div class="sec sec-first" id="S10"><p></p><h4 class="inline" id="S10title">Occupational exposure </h4><p class="p p-first" id="P37">Occupational exposure to aluminium occurs during the refining of the primary metal and in secondary industries that use aluminium products. Several studies have reported adverse respiratory tract effects in aluminium industry employees. Asthma-like symptoms, known as potroom asthma, have been the most intensely investigated respiratory effect. Wheezing, dyspnea, and impaired lung function (typically assessed by measuring forced expiratory volume (FEV<sub>1</sub>) and forced volume capacity (FVC)) are the primary features of this disorder. Several cross-sectional, case-control and longitudinal studies have demonstrated increased frequency of adverse pulmonary effects in potroom workers as compared to non-exposed workers. The cause of potroom asthma has not been fully elucidated, but job specific exposure measurements based on personal sampling data and analysis of plasma levels suggests that exposure to fluorides may be an important determinant. There is some evidence to support that individuals with hay fever and individuals with elevated eosinophil counts are at increased risk of developing potroom asthma. Other studies did not find an association between allergic status and the development of symptoms. The respiratory problems documented in potroom aluminium workers are generally associated with toxic chemicals other than aluminium in the workplace. In contrast, exposure to aluminium powder is thought to be directly correlated with the development of pulmonary fibrosis in aluminium industry workers.</p><p id="P38">Adverse neurological outcomes as a result of occupational aluminium exposure have also been extensively investigated. Aluminium exposure in these studies was estimated in a number of different ways including; exposure grading for different job categories, determination of total body burden of aluminium, number of years working in the aluminium industry, and ever v.s. never worked in the aluminium industry. Occupational aluminium exposure was significantly correlated with a variety of neuropyschiatric symptoms including; loss of coordination, loss of memory, and problems with balance. Studies which specifically examined the relationship between AD and occupational aluminium exposure did not show any significant correlation. However, these studies are limited by methodological issues.</p><p id="P39">The occurrence of contact dermatitis and irritant dermatitis was reported in workers exposed to aluminium alloys and aluminium dust.</p><p id="P40">Several epidemiological studies have reported an increased risk of developing lung cancer or bladder cancer for workers in the aluminium industry, however, in all of these studies the risk has been attributed to the exposure to the PAHs generated during aluminium production rather than from exposure to aluminium compounds. Studies investigating the effects of occupational exposure to aluminium are limited by many methodological issues. Rarely is a worker exposed solely to aluminium containing compounds and exposure information is often not adequate to rule out other toxic substances as the cause of the observed effect. Small sample sizes, misclassification bias, selection of inappropriate comparison groups, and lack of information to control for confounding factors are common weaknesses in these occupational studies.</p><p id="P41">Changes typical of foreign body reaction, alveolar proteinosis and wall thickening, diffuse pulmonary fibrosis and interstitial emphysema, and some nodule formation but not to the extent of fibrosis caused by quartz dust were associated with occupational exposure in the aluminium industry. This was most severe in Germany during World War II, where industrial environments were heavily contaminated with airborne aluminium flake powder. Lower aluminium exposures contribute to Shaver’s disease, a pulmonary fibrosis seen in workers in bauxite refining or exposed to finely divided aluminium powders; and caused pneumoconiosis, fibrosis, and some cases of asthma.</p><p id="P42">Only one case-control study examined associations between genotype and the development of asthma for workers employed in a potroom. However this study with very low power did not find any association.</p><p class="p p-last" id="P43">No reliable epidemiological studies exist to reach any conclusion on an association between occupational exposure to aluminium and fertility or developmental effects. No clear results have been obtained on gene-environment interactions.</p></div><div class="sec" id="S11"><p></p><h4 class="inline" id="S11title">Non-occupational exposure </h4><p class="p p-first" id="P44">The neurotoxic properties of aluminium are well established; however, the evidence surrounding the potential association between aluminium and neurological disorders in humans is much less clear. Aluminium exposure from drinking water has been extensively investigated in relation to the development of neurological disorders, including AD, due to the proposed enhanced bioavailability of aluminium in this form. The data surrounding this association is difficult to interpret due to the large variation in study designs and the highly variable quality of these studies. The majority, but not all, of epidemiological studies identified, reported a positive association between aluminium levels in drinking water and risk of cognitive impairment dementia, or AD. There is some evidence to suggest silica in drinking water is protective against the development of dementia. Fluoride has also been identified as having a potential protective effect. Many of the studies which have investigated the relationship between aluminium in drinking water supplies and the risk of developing AD are limited by methodological issues. These issues include: lack of individual exposure information, poor disease ascertainment, failure to adjust for important confounding factors, and small sample sizes. A recent study conducted in France is methodologically superior to the other studies conducted to date. The finding of a significant positive relationship between drinking water aluminium levels and the development of AD in this large prospective study, together with the finding of a positive relationship in a number of less methodologically sound studies, suggests that the association between aluminium and AD should be further investigated.</p><p id="P45">Regular consumers of antacids represent a unique subpopulation with heavy exposure to aluminium. A significantly elevated odds ratio for AD for regular antacid consumers compared to non-regular users was found; however, when only aluminium containing acids were analyzed there was no significant association. Other studies have not found a significant association between antacid use and AD. Little is known about the impact of aluminium-containing antacids in human pregnancy and lactation.</p><p id="P46">Evidence surrounding the relationship between aluminium in food and the risk of AD is very minimal. This may be a result of the difficulty in obtaining accurate exposure information in dietary studies. One small case control study found a positive relationship between the consumption of foods containing high levels of aluminium and the risk of developing AD. These results have not been confirmed in a larger investigation.</p><p id="P47">There is a large body of literature, mostly in the form of clinical reports, which documents the adverse effects of non-occupational aluminium exposure in individuals with impaired renal function. These patients are typically exposed to aluminium through dialysate fluid or medicinal sources. Anaemia, bone disease, and dialysis encephalopathy are the most commonly reported complications of aluminium exposure in this population.</p><p id="P48">Contact sensitivity to aluminium is very rare. Sensitization has occurred after injection of aluminium-adjuvant containing vaccines and pollen extracts, resulting in persistent granuloma at the injection site. These effects are much more frequent with aluminium hydroxide than aluminium phosphate adjuvants and more commonly seen following subcutaneous (s.c.) than i.m. injection. Less common is sensitivity during continuous application of aluminium-containing antiperspirants, topical aluminium application, and occupational exposure to aluminium dust and filings which result in recurrent eczema.</p><p id="P49">Only a few epidemiological studies with no clear results have been undertaken of the possible carcinogenic risks (such as breast cancer) of antiperspirants.</p><p id="P50">The exact genetic effects of Tf (a major transport protein for both iron and aluminium) itself or its interaction with aluminium remains unclear and has led to contradictory results.</p><p class="p p-last" id="P51">As a result of inadvertent human poisoning with excessive amounts of aluminium, there are reports of damage to bone and CNS as target organs. Further, the administration of aluminium-containing vaccines for extended time periods was found to be associated with the development of MMF at the injection site. In the past, individuals with impaired renal function receiving dialysis were reported to be at greater risk for aluminium intoxication associated with contaminated replacement fluids. However, this incidence has diminished markedly in recent years with the use of non-contaminated fluid and replacement of high-dose antacid therapy with alternatives. Although infants and children may be at higher risk for toxicity due to aluminium, a causal relationship was not confirmed. Hence, it should be noted that only at excessive concentrations of aluminium are toxic manifestations seen in human sensitive subpopulations.</p></div><div class="sec sec-last" id="S12"><p></p><h4 class="inline" id="S12title">Conclusions </h4><p class="p p-first" id="P52">This report synthesizes data from relevant studies on potential health effects of exposure to aluminium to quantify risk using the four-step process specified by the National Research Council: 1) hazard identification, 2) exposure assessment, 3) dose-response assessment, and 4) risk characterization.</p><p class="p p-last" id="P53">Hazard identification qualitatively identifies adverse effects by route of exposure, and determines whether those effects are likely in humans at <span class="underline">some</span> level of exposure, perhaps much greater than exposure levels experienced in the population of interest. It is important to note that the identification of effects that can be caused by aluminium says nothing about how likely those effects are at exposure levels in human populations. That probability depends on the level of exposure and the dose-response relationship. This report classified the weight of evidence for each exposure pathway and health effect as strong, modest, limited, or having no clear evidence (see <a class="fig-table-link figpopup" co-legend-rid="" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2782734/table/T25/" rid-figpopup="T25" rid-ob="ob-T25" target="table"><span>Table 25</span></a>). We concluded that there is strong evidence that aluminium can cause irritation following exposure via either inhalation or injection. Modest evidence of an effect exists for reproductive toxicity following oral exposure, for neurological toxicity following either oral or injection exposure, and for bone toxicity following injection exposure. All other effects were judged to be supported by either limited evidence or no clear evidence at all. Exposure assessment, dose-response assessment, and risk characterization were conducted for those effects for which the evidence was judged to be either strong or modest. The remainder of this section describes our findings for the general population, subpopulations at special risk, and occupationally-exposed populations.</p><div class="table-wrap table anchored

For the general population, intake of aluminium from food (7.2 mg/day for females and 8.6 mg/day for males) dominated that from drinking water (0.16 mg/day) and inhalation exposure (0.06 mg/day). Antacids and buffered aspirin can contribute on the order of thousands of mg/day to aluminium intake. Relative contributions to uptake are ranked similarly to these intake contributions. However, because inhaled aluminium is approximately seven times more bioavailable than aluminium in drinking water, the contribution of inhaled aluminium to uptake (1.7 × 10<sup>-5</sup> mg/kg b.w./day) exceeds the corresponding contribution from drinking water (6.9 × 10<sup>-6</sup> mg/kg b.w./day).

The evidence supporting this effect, however, comes from studies that have a number of methodological limitations, a finding that suggests the causal nature of the association is uncertain.</p><div class="table-wrap table anchored whole_rhythm" id="T27"><h3>Table 27</h3><div class="caption"><p id="__p92">Comparison between effects at which aluminium induces adverse health effects and levels of human exposure.</p></div><div class="xtable" data-largeobj="" data-largeobj-link-rid="largeobj_idm140111444055184"><table class="rendered small default_table" frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1"></th><th align="center" colspan="1" rowspan="1"></th><th align="center" colspan="2" rowspan="1">General Population</th><th align="center" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Occupational Population</th></tr><tr><th align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">Pathway and Endpoint</th><th align="center" colspan="1" rowspan="1">Exposure Level of Concern</th><th align="center" colspan="1" rowspan="1">Exposure</th><th align="center" colspan="1" rowspan="1">MOE<sup>a</sup></th><th align="center" colspan="1" rowspan="1">Exposure</th><th align="center" colspan="1" rowspan="1">MOE<sup>a</sup></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">Inhalation</td><td align="center" colspan="1" rowspan="1"></td><td align="center" colspan="1" rowspan="1"></td><td align="center" colspan="1" rowspan="1"></td><td align="center" colspan="1" rowspan="1"></td><td align="center" colspan="1" rowspan="1"></td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1"> Irritation</td><td align="center" colspan="1" rowspan="1">50 mg/m<sup>3</sup><sup>b</sup></td><td align="center" colspan="1" rowspan="1">0.007 mg/m<sup>3</sup></td><td align="center" colspan="1" rowspan="1">7000</td><td align="center" colspan="1" rowspan="1">6 mg/m<sup>3</sup></td><td align="center" colspan="1" rowspan="1">8</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">Oral</td><td align="center" colspan="1" rowspan="1"></td><td align="center" colspan="1" rowspan="1"></td><td align="center" colspan="1" rowspan="1"></td><td align="center" colspan="1" rowspan="1"></td><td align="center" colspan="1" rowspan="1"></td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1"> Neurological (AD)</td><td align="center" colspan="1" rowspan="1">≥100 μg/L water<sup>c</sup></td><td align="center" colspan="1" rowspan="1">100 μg/L</td><td align="center" colspan="1" rowspan="1">≥1</td><td align="center" colspan="1" rowspan="1">N/A</td><td align="center" colspan="1" rowspan="1"></td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1"> Reproductive Toxicity</td><td align="center" colspan="1" rowspan="1">400 mg/kg b.w./day<sup>d</sup></td><td align="center" colspan="1" rowspan="1">0.14 mg/kg b.w./day<sup>e</sup></td><td align="center" colspan="1" rowspan="1">2900</td><td align="center" colspan="1" rowspan="1">N/A</td><td align="center" colspan="1" rowspan="1"></td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">Injection</td><td align="center" colspan="1" rowspan="1"></td><td align="center" colspan="1" rowspan="1"></td><td align="center" colspan="1" rowspan="1"></td><td align="center" colspan="1" rowspan="1"></td><td align="center" colspan="1" rowspan="1"></td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1"> Irritation</td><td align="center" colspan="1" rowspan="1">One injection<sup>f</sup></td><td align="center" colspan="1" rowspan="1"></td><td align="center" colspan="1" rowspan="1">&lt; 1</td><td align="center" colspan="1" rowspan="1">N/A</td><td align="center" colspan="1" rowspan="1"></td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1"> Neurological</td><td align="center" colspan="1" rowspan="1">One injection<sup>f</sup></td><td align="center" colspan="1" rowspan="1"></td><td align="center" colspan="1" rowspan="1">Large</td><td align="center" colspan="1" rowspan="1">N/A</td><td align="center" colspan="1" rowspan="1"></td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1"> Bone toxicity</td><td align="center" colspan="1" rowspan="1">Large<sup>g</sup></td><td align="center" colspan="1" rowspan="1"></td><td align="center" colspan="1" rowspan="1">Large</td><td align="center" colspan="1" rowspan="1">N/A</td><td align="center" colspan="1" rowspan="1"></td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class="largeobj-link align_right" id="largeobj_idm140111444055184" style="display: none"><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2782734/table/T27/?report=objectonly" target="object">Open in a separate window</a></div><div class="tblwrap-foot"><div id="TFN60"><sup>a</sup>The MOE is the ratio of the exposure level of concern to the exposure level.

We are unaware of members of the general population who would have to receive injections containing aluminium for this duration.

This population can also be exposed to extremely high levels of aluminium that are administered inadvertently via their intravenous feeds. This route of exposure may be particularly significant because it bypasses the barrier imposed by GI absorption characteristics. Infants, especially those born pre-term, are also vulnerable to aluminium exposure due to immaturity of the GI wall, the BBB, and the renal system. In addition to their added susceptibility due to compromised renal function, patients on dialysis may be subject to higher aluminium exposure levels if dialysis or intravenous fluid becomes contaminated, a problem that was more common in the past. Although not explicitly quantified, the susceptibility of these populations suggests that the exposure level of concern is less than it is for the general population. At the same time, some sensitive populations may have been exposed to very high aluminium exposures in the past. Because of the substantial quantities of injected fluids received by dialysis patients and their increased susceptibility, the MOE for this pathway for this population may be less than unity.</p></div><div class="sec" id="S15"><h3 id="S15title">Occupationally-exposed populations</h3><p class="p p-first-last" id="P57">Occupational populations can be exposed to airborne concentrations of aluminium exceeding concentrations to which the general population is exposed by approximately three orders of magnitude (see <a class="fig-table-link figpopup" co-legend-rid="" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2782734/table/T26/" rid-figpopup="T26" rid-ob="ob-T26" target="table"><span>Table 26</span></a>).

Hydrothermal oxidation of aluminium powders at 150-250°C and water vapour pressures of 500-4500 kPa suggest that surface-adsorbed water oxidizes the aluminium with the release of molecular hydrogen and the formation of aluminium hydroxyoxides on the particle surface (<a class="bibr popnode" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/#R1324" rid="R1324">Tikhov et al., 2003</a>). Similarly, thermogravimetric studies of aluminium powders have shown that oxidation with molecular oxygen generates surface layers composed of various aluminium oxide polymorphs, specifically the γ-, θ-, and α- forms depending on the temperature (<a class="bibr popnode" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/#R1340" rid="R1340">Trunov et al., 2005</a>) (see also <em>Identity, Physical and Chemical Properties, Analytical Methods, Physical and Chemical Properties, Chemical and Morphological Speciation</em>). Furthermore, aluminium metal is soluble in dilute mineral acids, but is inactivated (passivated) by concentrated nitric acid; it is attacked by hot alkali hydroxides (<a class="bibr popnode" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/#R243" rid="R243">Cotton &amp; Wilkinson, 1980</a>).</p></div><div class="sec" id="S22"><p></p><h4 class="inline" id="S22title">Properties of aluminium compounds </h4><p class="p p-first" id="P67"><a class="fig-table-link figpopup" co-legend-rid="" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2782734/table/T3/" rid-figpopup="T3" rid-ob="ob-T3" target="table"><span>Table 3</span></a> summarizes the available physico-chemical properties of the compounds.

compounds is limited except for its salts, namely the chloride, nitrate, sulphate and chlorate (often as a corresponding hydrate). Salts of low molecular organic acids also have some water solubility (e.g., acetate, benzoate and lactate), as do salts containing aluminium anion complexes (e.g., ammonium hexafluoroaluminate and tetrachloroaluminate; sodium and potassium aluminate.) As explained in <em>Identity, Physical and Chemical Properties, Analytical Methods, Physical and Chemical Properties, Chemical and Morphological Speciation</em>, pH is often a factor that can limit solubility in water. Solubility of inorganic aluminium compounds in organic solvents is limited to those which are anhydrous such as the bromides, chlorides, and iodides. Aluminium alkyls, alkyl halides, alkoxides and complexes of long-chain FAs and of high molecular mass organic ligands exhibit solubility in organic solvents.</p><p id="P69">Aluminium metal, aluminium oxide and aluminium hydroxide are nearly insoluble in water and organic solvents, while freshly prepared aluminium metal surfaces do react with water to form an inert protective coating. By contrast, powdered aluminium can react with water to yield hydrogen gas (see below <em>Identity, Physical and Chemical Properties, Analytical Methods, Physical and Chemical Properties, Chemical and Morphological Speciation</em>).</p><p id="P70">In terms of chemical reactivity, the following compounds are notable for their reactions with water: aluminium alkyls, alkyl halides, hydrides; the anhydrous halides (namely bromide, chloride and iodide); and the carbide, chlorate, nitride and phosphide. Explosive gases are released on contact with water, specifically hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>) from the hydrides and methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) from the carbide. Release of toxic gases on hydration can also occur, that is chlorine dioxide (ClO<sub>2</sub>) from the chlorate; ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>) from the nitride; phosphine (PH<sub>3</sub>) from the phosphide; and hydrogen sulphide (H<sub>2</sub>S) from the sulphide.</p><p id="P71">As described in <em>Identity, Physical and Chemical Properties, Analytical Methods, Physical and Chemical Properties, Chemical and Morphological Speciation</em>, the Al<sup>3+</sup> ion has a very high affinity for the hydroxide ion, even at relatively low pH values. This is consistent with the Class A (Hard) cation reactivity classification of Al<sup>3+</sup>, that is, it strongly prefers oxygen-containing organic ligands over those with nitrogen or sulphur as the donor atom. Its affinity for the halide anions increases in the order I<sup>−</sup>&lt;Br<sup>−</sup>&lt;Cl<sup>−</sup>≪F<sup>−</sup> (<a class="bibr popnode" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/#R946" rid="R946">Nieboer &amp; Fletcher, 1996</a>; <a class="bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/#R949" id="__tag_185977439" rid="R949">Nieboer et al., 1999</a>; <a class="bibr popnode" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/#R947" rid="R947">Nieboer &amp; Richardson; 1980</a>).

As a Class A (Hard) cation, the chemistry of Al<sup>3+</sup> resembles that of Mg<sup>2+</sup>, Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup>.

Because of the small size of the unhydrated Al<sup>3+</sup>, it can also bond to the phenolic group of the amino acid tyrosine in proteins. Most of the Al<sup>3+</sup> in human serum is bound to the protein Tf (see <em>Toxicokinetics, Distribution (Including Compartmentalization), Human Studies, Transport in Blood</em>), which is a recognized carrier of trivalent metal ions, especially Fe<sup>3+</sup> (<a class="bibr popnode" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/#R80" rid="R80">Barker et al., 1990</a>; <a class="bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/#R571" id="__tag_185976233" rid="R571">Harris, 1992</a>; <a class="bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/#R573" id="__tag_185976599" rid="R573">Harris et al., 1996</a>).

The <em>inhalable aerosol fraction</em> corresponds to the total amount of airborne particulates that enters the body through the nose and/or mouth during breathing (aerodynamic diameters (d<sub>ae</sub>) of ≤ 100μm). The <em>thoracic aerosol fraction</em> penetrates the tracheoalveolar region of the lung (d<sub>ae</sub> &lt; 28μm), while the <em>respirable aerosol fraction</em> (d<sub>ae</sub> &lt; 10μm) penetrates the alveolar region of the lung (includes the respiratory bronchioles, the alveolar ducts and sacs).

It is very hard and resistant to hydration and attack by acids; it occurs in nature as corundum (<a class="bibr popnode" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/#R243" rid="R243">Cotton &amp; Wilkinson 1980</a>). γ-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> is generated at 500°C and readily takes up water and dissolves in acids.

Recent studies suggest that the structure of the surface layers of α-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> depends on hydration: on the surface of a highly polished single crystal, the aluminium atom (more correctly Al<sup>3+</sup> ions) are exposed, while in the ideal (unrelaxed) structure the oxygen atoms (actually oxide anions, O<sup>2-</sup>) are at the surface. On hydration, the latter are overlaid by a semi-ordered absorbed water layer with the presence of extensive hydrogen bonding and hydroxyl groups resulting in a relaxed structure. In fact, the hydrated surface structure appears to be in between that of the ideal α-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> surface and that of γ-Al(OH)<sub>3</sub>. The Al<sup>3+</sup> ions in the Al-terminated surface are strong Lewis acids and react strongly with water, while surface hydroxyl groups are Lewis bases that interact with metal ions (<a class="bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/#R361" id="__tag_185977797" rid="R361">Eng et al., 2000</a>). Surface reactivity constitutes the basis for the use of aluminium oxide and hydroxide as industrial catalysts, absorbents and chromatography packing materials (i.e., as stationary phases). Not surprisingly, the reactivity of solid Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> depends on its specific crystal structure and hydrophilic/hydrophobic surface properties, and thus the degree of surface hydration (<a class="bibr popnode" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/#R1008" rid="R1008">Pearson, 1992</a>).</p><p id="P82">Gibbsite, γ-Al(OH)<sub>3</sub> [CAS No 14762-49-3] is one of the three minerals that make up bauxite ore; the others being Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and the oxyhydroxides boehmite [α-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> • H<sub>2</sub>O or α-AlO(OH)] and diaspore [β- Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> • H<sub>2</sub>O or β-AlO(OH)].

At the solid-solution interface, proton association and dissociation can lead to pH-dependent surface charges and complexation. This is further complicated by specific adsorption of cations or anions right at the solid/solution interface, with some ordering of counter-ions in a more diffuse layer at points further into the solution (<a class="bibr popnode" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/#R1278" rid="R1278">Stumm &amp; Morgan, 1996</a>). A zero point of charge occurs, which is pH dependent. It is also influenced by the extent of specific ion adsorption.

At neutral pH, gels of these compounds have different charges, the phosphate being negative and the hydroxide positive. This is important, relative to the charge borne by the antigen at physiological pH.

More recently, stable surface coatings have been developed which render the Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> surface hydrophobic, which makes it even more versatile in chromatographic applications. Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and the aluminium oxyhydroxides are used to remove moisture from gases such as argon, alkanes, and sulphur dioxide. They are also used to remove hydrogen fluoride (HF) from air by adsorption; fluoride ions can also be removed effectively by them from water. Fluoride is adsorbed on to alumina at low pH values and can be desorbed on increasing the pH. Clearly, the inhalation of particulates of Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and related oxyhydroxides in aluminium smelting operations may constitute a delivery vehicle for adsorbed HF (<a class="bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/#R598" id="__tag_185977823" rid="R598">Höflich et al., 2005</a>; <a class="bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/#R748" id="__tag_185977008" rid="R748">L’vov et al., 2005</a>).

However pure aluminium is extremely soft and therefore is often mixed with other metals and elements (e.g., copper, magnesium, manganese, silicon, lithium and zinc) to form alloys which are stronger and harder and hence of increased versatility (<a class="bibr popnode" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/#R68" rid="R68">ATSDR, 1999</a>; <a class="bibr popnode" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/#R1407" rid="R1407">Wagner, 1999</a>).

Reference to the uses of aluminium thus normally relates to those for aluminium as an alloy.</p><p id="P118">Aluminium metal and its alloys are used extensively in building construction (e.g., siding, roofing, doors, windows), in transportation (in the manufacture of automobiles and aircraft), in packaging (e.g., for beverage cans), and in electrical equipment. Other uses include die-cast motor parts, cooking utensils, decorations, road signs, fencing, beverage cans, coloured kitchenware, food packaging, foil, corrosion-resistant chemical equipment, solid fuel rocket propellants and explosives, dental crowns, jewellery and denture materials. Aluminium is also used for power lines, electrical conductors, insulated cables and wiring (<a class="bibr popnode" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/#R68" rid="R68">ATSDR, 1999</a>; <a class="bibr popnode" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/#R619" rid="R619">IAI, 2006b</a>).

However, most of this research, including all of that carried out prior to 1990, has been conducted using <sup>27</sup>Al. To determine oral aluminium bioavailability, which is very low, and to see a significant increase of aluminium in blood, urine or tissue above the endogenous aluminium concentration, it was necessary to give very large doses of <sup>27</sup>Al. More recently, studies have been conducted to estimate oral aluminium bioavailability using <sup>26</sup>Al.</p><p id="P178">Bioavailability (fractional absorption) is the amount of a substance absorbed compared to the amount administered. With respect to the toxicokinetics of aluminium, systemic bioavailability, the fraction that ultimately reaches systemic circulation from where it has access to the brain and bone, the target organs for its toxicity, is most relevant. Oral aluminium bioavailability has been determined using several methods. Each of the methods has strengths and weaknesses. One of the first used was the balance study in which <span class="underline">absorption</span> was estimated based on the difference between intake and <span class="underline">faecal, or urinary-plus- faecal, excretion</span>. Estimating aluminium absorption based on the difference between intake and faecal excretion is not accurate for aluminium, for which oral bioavailability is very low. This approach assumes the difference between aluminium intake and faecal excretion is that which is absorbed and retained or excreted in the urine, which is the major route of elimination of absorbed aluminium. Small errors in determination of aluminium in faeces can significantly influence the estimate of bioavailability. As oral aluminium absorption is 1% or less under most conditions, with the balance passing through the GI tract unabsorbed, it would be very difficult to accurately determine the 1% loss of aluminium due to absorption based on the difference between oral intake and faecal excretion.

Balance studies that estimate <span class="underline">retention</span> based on the difference between intake and <span class="underline">urinary-plus-faecal excretion</span> tend to overestimate the bioavailability of aluminium because aluminium can be retained on the gut wall and then be eventually excreted in faeces, but not absorbed.

This method has many advantages. Collection of urine is less invasive than the sample collection requirements for most other methods that estimate oral bioavailability, which typically include blood and/or tissue. However, in the single dose, non-steady-state study, collection of all urine, or at least urine collection for a sufficient duration to ensure that nearly all of the urinary aluminium output from the dose has been obtained, is required. This is difficult when <sup>27</sup>Al has been used as the aluminium dose because it is necessary to distinguish urinary excretion of the aluminium administered in the test dose from that ingested prior to the study or from other sources during the study. The requirement for total urine collection is also a compliance issue for the human subject. In the steady-state study, a sample collection period representing normal urinary aluminium output should be sufficient to reduce the compliance issue. Calculation of bioavailability assumes that all absorbed aluminium is excreted in the urine. This method may underestimate bioavailability due to the aluminium eliminated in bile, although this is only ~ 1%, (see 5.3.1.2 below), and the aluminium retained during the duration of the study. In a human study, <a class="bibr popnode" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/#R1266" rid="R1266">Stauber et al. (1999)</a> utilized two correction factors to estimate oral aluminium bioavailability.

They suggested that, when the stomach contents enter the duodenum/jejunum where the pH increases to 4.5 to 6.8, all aluminium would be converted to hydroxides. They predicted uniform oral bioavailability of aluminium, independent of the chemical species of the aluminium consumed. However, this ignores the presence of ligands to compete with hydroxide to associate with aluminium at the site of absorption. Using the <em>in situ</em> rat intestine preparation with systemic and portal blood sampling, <a class="bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/#R1371" id="__tag_185977012" rid="R1371">Van der Voet &amp; de Wolff (1986-1987)</a> found aluminium absorption to be higher at pH 4 than at pH 7, presumably due to generation of more soluble aluminium species.

Citrate can complex aluminium, forming an electrically neutral 1:1 citrate:aluminium complex at pH 2 to 5 in the absence of great excess of citrate. At higher pHs, this complex deprotonates, with a pKa of ~ 4, to a complex with one negative charge held by a carboxylate group that is not involved in the aluminium citrate:complex (<a class="bibr popnode" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/#R751" rid="R751">Lakatos et al., 2001</a>).

Citrate is the major small molecular weight ligand for aluminium in plasma. Formation of aluminium citrate also enables the distribution of aluminium out of plasma, and may enhance aluminium elimination by the kidney in the presence of renal function. However, in the absence of renal function, citrate can significantly increase aluminium-induced toxicity, presumably by enhancing aluminium distribution out of the blood and the resultant tissue aluminium accumulation. However, the enhanced solubility of aluminium by citrate did not completely account for enhanced aluminium absorption (<a class="bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/#R445" id="__tag_185977752" rid="R445">Froment et al., 1989b</a>).

Furthermore, in the presence of equimolar aluminium and citrate, aluminium citrate-hydroxide complexes would predominate (W.R. Harris, personal communication, 2004). Alternatively, enhanced aluminium absorption may require sufficient citrate to activate another mechanism of aluminium absorption. Other hypotheses to explain the enhancement of aluminium absorption by citrate are the transport of aluminium citrate into mucosal cells, and citrate opening the tight junctions of the intestinal cells, as discussed in <em>Toxicokinetics, Absorption, Animal Studies, Oral Administration, The Site and Mechanisms of Oral Aluminium Absorption</em>.</p><p id="P217">Numerous animal studies have shown that aluminium is more bioavailable when administered as the citrate rather than as other chemical species (<a class="bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/#R257" id="__tag_185977717" rid="R257">Cunat et al., 2000</a>; <a class="bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/#R291" id="__tag_185976217" rid="R291">Deng et al., 1998</a>; <a class="bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/#R292" id="__tag_185977803" rid="R292">2000</a>; <a class="bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/#R331" id="__tag_185978044" rid="R331">Drüeke et al., 1997</a>; <a class="bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/#R445" id="__tag_185977659" rid="R445">Froment et al., 1989b</a>; <a class="bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/#R1002" id="__tag_185976304" rid="R1002">Partridge et al., 1989</a>; <a class="bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/#R1003" id="__tag_185976686" rid="R1003">1992</a>; <a class="bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/#R1169" id="__tag_185976869" rid="R1169">Schönholzer et al., 1997</a>; <a class="bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/#R1284" id="__tag_185977772" rid="R1284">Sutherland &amp; Greger, 1998</a>; <a class="bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/#R1375" id="__tag_185976381" rid="R1375">Van der Voet et al.,1989</a>; <a class="bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/#R1485" id="__tag_185977645" rid="R1485">Yokel &amp; McNamara, 1988</a>).

They hypothesized that foods may alter aluminium absorption. The presence of food may change the pH. It has been suggested that food may bind aluminium, hence reducing its bioavailability. Therefore, it has been suggested that enhanced aluminium absorption may occur in the presence of an empty stomach, especially during periods of fasting.

They exposed anesthetized rats to 2 mL of water containing no aluminium, or 8 mg aluminium as aluminium sulphate and/or various beverages and foods by gastric administration. Blood was obtained from the tail, prior to and 1, 2, 3 and 4 hr after, dosing. Urine was obtained, at the same times after dosing, by needle aspiration from the bladder. Considering the short period of observation (4 hr), serum aluminium is probably a better indicator of absorbed aluminium than is aluminium excreted in the urine. Administration of 8 mg aluminium in water increased peak serum aluminium about 4.5-fold and produced a urinary aluminium concentration of 2.6 μg/L. Co-administration of orange juice, coffee and wine with the aluminium significantly increased peak serum aluminium levels, compared to administration of aluminium alone, approximately 17-, 2.5-, and 1.9-fold, respectively. Serum aluminium peaked at 1 hr when given alone. The time of peak serum aluminium in the presence of co-administered foods was not reported. Therefore, it is not known if the rates of aluminium absorption are similar and, as a result, if the 4 blood samples obtained represent similar time profiles of the aluminium absorbed. Urinary aluminium concentration increased approximately 10.5-, 1.3- and 1.8-fold when these three beverages were co-administered with aluminium. Meat and Vita Wheat® biscuits (a carbohydrate/cereal product) significantly attenuated the elevation in serum aluminium caused by aluminium dosing to 62 and 65%, when compared to administration of aluminium alone. Urinary aluminium was attenuated by these two foods to 45 and 57%. These foods were available for 36 hr prior to their co-administration with the aluminium, to “<em>load the gastrointestinal tract with the single food and its breakdown products</em>.” In contrast, no food was available for 36 hr prior to aluminium alone or beverage (plus aluminium) dosing. In preliminary studies, the investigators found food in the stomach 24 hr after removal of food access, so they went to 36-hr food deprivation. They did not verify the lack of stomach contents after 36-hr food deprivation. As noted above, this does not assure the lack of stomach contents. Co-administration of beer, Coca-Cola®, tea, apple, broccoli, butter and margarine produced non-significant effects. Co-administration of both orange juice and Vita Wheat® with aluminium resulted in an increase of serum aluminium levels of 9.1-fold, an attenuation of the result seen with orange juice alone, but urine aluminium concentration was not attenuated by the addition of Vita Wheat® to the aluminium plus orange juice administration. No definitive conclusions can be made from this study. The results from co-administration of coffee and wine, which slightly increased serum and urine aluminium levels, and meat and the cereal product, which decreased serum and urine aluminium levels, suggest that co-administration of certain foods with drugs or foods that contain significant amounts of aluminium warrants further study.</p></div></div><div class="sec sec-last" id="S88"><p></p><h5 class="inline" id="S88title">The site and mechanisms of oral aluminium absorption </h5><p class="p p-first" id="P244">Aluminium, like most substances, is better absorbed from the upper intestine than from the stomach.

A 10 mm disk of the exposed skin contained ≤ 7 μg aluminium. Removal of the stratum corneum (the outer layer of the skin that is 25 to 35 μm thick) by stripping with adhesive tape resulted in no greater aluminium penetration into the dermis.

The total aluminium applied during this time (0.5 to 2 mg/kg) is comparable to a one day aluminium exposure of humans using topical antiperspirants. Twenty-four hr urine samples were obtained starting 1 day after completion of aluminium dosing. Blood and brain samples were also obtained. A statistically significant increase was reported in urinary and serum aluminium concentrations after both aluminium exposures, compared to those for non-exposed mice of the same age. This suggests that a small fraction of the typical human use of a topical antiperspirant might produce a measurable increase in urine and tissue aluminium levels. Increases in brain aluminium levels were 19 to 124% over controls. The aluminium concentration in the hippocampus was reported to be 2 to 3 times the rest of the brain in controls and aluminium-exposed mice. This could be an artifact of aluminium contamination, which would be more pronounced in a smaller sample (hippocampus) than in the rest of the brain. Dermal exposure of mice pups from 2 to 22 days of age to 0.025, 0.05 or 0.1 μg aluminium chloride/cm<sup>2</sup> increased their brain aluminium levels by 5 to 24%.

The aluminium solution was applied over a 4 cm<sup>2</sup> area on the back, which represents about 12% of the total body surface area of the mouse. It is quite possible that grooming produced oral aluminium exposure. A 20 g mouse receiving a total of 2 mg Al/kg would receive 0.04 mg of aluminium. Retention of 5 × 10<sup>-5</sup> of the administered aluminium by each gram of brain, as has been reported after i.v. aluminium injection (see <em>Toxicokinetics, Distribution (Including Compartmentalization), Animal Studies, Central Nervous System</em>), which corresponds to 100% bioavailability, would raise brain aluminium levels by 2 × 10<sup>-3</sup> mg Al/kg (2 ppm).

Anatomically, the olfactory system as a route of delivery to the brain is intriguing as well as problematic for interpretation. The olfactory receptor neurons are the first-order neurons located within the nasal cavity in the olfactory epithelium. Their cell bodies lie in the basal two thirds of the epithelium. Several cilia extend from each cell into the mucous layer of the epithelium. These cells are separated and partially ensheathed by supporting cells of the olfactory epithelium. The axons of these neurons project via the olfactory nerve (the first cranial nerve) to the olfactory bulb and synaptically terminate on the mitral and tufted cells. These cells then relay via neurotransmitter synapses to higher order olfactory structures and to other brain systems. Such neurotransmitter target sites include the olfactory peduncle, the piriform cortex, the olfactory tubercle, the entorhinal cortex, and some amygdaloid nuclei. Projections are made from these primary olfactory cortical structures to other brain regions. While this distinct anatomical pathway exists, to serve as a direct route of exposure to the brain would require the axonal transport of the material of concern as well as the trans-synaptic transport from one neuron to the next within the pathway.</p><p id="P259">An alternative route from the nasal passage has been proposed, that is exposure via the CSF. In this case, delivery would be from diffusion of the compound through the perineural fluid around the olfactory nerve through the cribriform plate.

It is suggested above (see <em>Toxicokinetics, Absorption, Animal Studies, Inhalation Exposure / Intranasal</em>) that absorption from the GI or olfactory tracts is unlikely to account for aluminium absorption after inhalation exposure.

These were balance studies, in which aluminium absorption was estimated from the difference between intake and faecal excretion. Aluminium retention was estimated from the difference between intake and faecal-plus-urinary excretion. However, it has become apparent that the percentage of aluminium that is orally absorbed is quite low (as noted in the animal studies above and more recent human studies, below). Therefore, studies using these methods are not considered reliable, as discussed above.</p><p id="P272">One of the few human studies of oral aluminium absorption that models drinking water is that reported by <a class="bibr popnode" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/#R1266" rid="R1266">Stauber et al.

The ATW provided 208 to 233 (in the absence of added sodium citrate) or 253 μg Al/day (when sodium citrate was added). The RSW provided &lt; 1 μg Al/day (when no sodium citrate was added) or 46 μg Al/day (when sodium citrate was added). Oral bioavailability was estimated from the 24 hr urinary aluminium output times 2.2. The value 2.2 was used to correct for the estimated fraction of total urinary aluminium excretion that occurs within the first 24 hr and the fraction of absorbed aluminium that is retained (e.g., does not appear in the urine). This is based on the fraction of aluminium excreted in the urine over 24 hr compared to that excreted over 7 days, which was estimated to be 0.62 by (<a class="bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/#R1046" id="__tag_185977570" rid="R1046">Priest, 1993</a>). It is also based on the fraction of aluminium administered intravenously that was found in the urine within 7 days by <a class="bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/#R1296" id="__tag_185976723" rid="R1296">Talbot et al. (1995)</a>, 0.72, suggesting the balance of the aluminium was retained. They concluded that the oral bioavailability of aluminium from water was 0.39% in the absence, and 0.36% in the presence, of citrate. This was based on the increase in 24 hr urinary aluminium excretion when the subjects consumed ATW and a controlled diet compared to RSW and the same diet, and the increased aluminium in ATW compared to RSW. The controlled diet was given to all subjects in the same amounts for three meals, three snacks, tea and a banana daily, delivering 1777 calories and 2.9 mg aluminium. It contained standard amounts of specific food components, including meat, cereal, milk, tea, and cookies, each of which was analyzed to determine its aluminium concentration. Aluminium in ATW represented 6 to 7% of total aluminium intake. Its consumption raised urinary aluminium output approximately 9%. Therefore, the response seen was &lt; 10% of background urinary aluminium excretion. A concern about this study is that one might expect the variability in the excretion of aluminium in the urine from food to mask any ability to see an increase in urinary aluminium output from the aluminium in water. The range of 24 hr urinary aluminium output in these subjects was 5-fold (1.8 to 9.3 μg). However, within-subject variability must have been considerably less for the results to produce a statistically significant difference in urinary aluminium output after consuming the ATW compared to RSW. This is indicated by the 95% confidence intervals (CI) that suggest considerably less variability than the 5-fold range of their subjects. The design of this study favoured the study objectives, to measure the amount of aluminium absorbed from water, above that contributed by food. Their study included within-subject comparisons and a defined diet containing a low amount of aluminium for the day before and the day of the study (3 mg vs. normal intake of 3 to 7 mg/day in Australia, according to the authors). <a class="bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/#R489" id="__tag_185977653" rid="R489">Glynn et al. (1995)</a> stated that the concentration of aluminium in drinking water has to be extremely high in relation to food to ensure that aluminium from the water is a significant part of the total oral aluminium intake. Similar concern expressed was: “<em>…biokinetic studies of injected or ingested aluminium in man and animals is complicated by the investigator’s inability to distinguish between aluminium from a test dose and that already present in the body. Most studies of stable aluminium are, thus, of poor sensitivity</em>.” (<a class="bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/#R1046" id="__tag_185977518" rid="R1046">Priest, 1993</a>).

The correction factors they used to estimate urinary aluminium output were based on two human studies conducted by other investigators in which <sup>26</sup>Al was used. These estimates may not accurately predict the fraction of aluminium excreted in urine in 1 day compared to that excreted to time infinity, and may not accurately predict the percentage retained, when that estimate is also based on 1 vs. 7 days of observations. Although these estimates may influence the absolute estimate of oral bioavailability, they are less likely to influence the relative estimates of aluminium bioavailability from water compared to that from food; this is discussed below.</p><p id="P273">A second study relevant to consumption of aluminium from drinking water involved 4 subjects who consumed a soft mineral water containing &lt; 1 μg Al/L, the same water with 300 μg Al/L as Al<sub>2</sub>(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub>, and deionized water containing 300 μg Al/L as Al<sub>2</sub>(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub> (<a class="bibr popnode" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/#R465" rid="R465">Gardner &amp; Gunn, 1995</a>).

However different aluminium species were consumed under these two conditions.</p><p id="P280">Aluminium bioavailability was estimated based on 24 hr urinary aluminium excretion in subjects consuming a controlled diet that included tea and RSW water (which provided essentially no aluminium) (<a class="bibr popnode" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/#R1266" rid="R1266">Stauber et al., 1999</a>). The ~ 3 mg Al/day provided by this diet is below typical dietary intake. Absorption of aluminium from food consumed prior to the study, which likely provided &gt; 3 mg Al/day, may have contributed to the urinary aluminium excretion during the study. This would produce an over-estimation of aluminium bioavailability from the controlled diet. The estimate of oral aluminium bioavailability from food-plus-tea in this study was ~ 0.53%, assuming that 10% of the aluminium in the tea was available for absorption. Based on the assumption that 100% of the aluminium in the tea was available for absorption, oral aluminium bioavailability from food-plus-tea was estimated to be 0.28%. Therefore, the authors concluded that oral aluminium bioavailability from water and food is comparable. They claimed “<em>… recent research suggesting that aluminium in food and aluminium in water have similar bioavailabilities</em>”, citing <a class="bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/#R1046" id="__tag_185977459" rid="R1046">Priest (1993)</a>.

The tea contained 2.3 to 2.8 mg aluminium and comprised about 31% of the total daily dietary aluminium intake. Blood was obtained 11 times, from immediately before to 0.5 to 24 hr after dosing.

Calculations suggested ~ 91% of plasma aluminium is associated with Tf, 7 to 8% with citrate, &lt; 1% with phosphate and hydroxide and essentially none with fluoride, glutamate or aspartate (<a class="bibr popnode" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/#R837" rid="R837">Martin, 1996</a>) and as determined by Dr. Wesley R.

This is relevant to all data reported in this review, with the exception of some <sup>27</sup>Al studies where plasma aluminium levels exceeded the aluminium binding capacity of Tf (about 1200 μg/L).

It does not appear that albumin binding of aluminium is physiologically important. Most recent studies concluded that Tf is the sole plasma protein which binds aluminium. Non-protein bound aluminium in plasma is believed to be associated with citrate and, to a lesser extent, phosphate. Therefore, aluminium distribution from blood to tissues probably involves aluminium Tf or aluminium citrate. Aluminium citrate readily distributes out of blood. After i.v. injection of aluminium as the citrate to one subject, &gt; 50% of the aluminium had distributed out of the blood within 15 minutes (<a class="bibr popnode" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/#R1047" rid="R1047">Priest, 1994</a>). The effects of citrate on brain and/or bone aluminium concentrations and uptake of aluminium into cells have been inconsistent.

One is for bone connected to the interstitial citrate compartment since the authors stated that studies in rats have shown that bones are supplied with aluminium by citrate. A second compartment represents muscles and organs including liver, kidneys and spleen connected to both central Tf compartments (plasma and interstitial fluid) as those organs receive aluminium from Tf. The third peripheral compartment is of unknown identity and was arbitrarily connected to the two central Tf compartments. Aluminium input was represented from a duodenal compartment into both the blood plasma Tf and citrate compartments.

Experimental studies to evaluate fibrogenic potential in rats i.e., the ability to induce pulmonary fibrosis of 4 different types of aluminium fibres including alpha (uncalcined form) and gamma alumina (calcined form) following single intratracheal injections, were performed by <a class="bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/#R262" id="__tag_185977941" rid="R262">Dalbey &amp; Pulkowski (2000)</a>. Six months after dosing, pulmonary function tests (functional residual capacity, deflation pressure-volume curves, maximal forced deflation, single breath carbon monoxide diffusion capacity, and pulmonary resistance) and histopathological evaluation were performed. Rales were noted during the first week of instillation in aluminium treated groups, but not in the groups given glass beads or quartz. Standard lung volume and maximal forced exhalation parameters were decreased at 6 months after instillation in aluminium treated groups as compared to animals injected with saline and glass beads (controls). Single-breath carbon monoxide diffusing capacity was significantly decreased in aluminium treated animals compared to both types of controls which indicated the presence of a physical barrier between the air in the alveoli and the blood. The weight of the postcaval lung lobe was significantly increased for all groups administered aluminas, and the most marked increase was seen in the quartz group. The histopathological changes were similar in all treated groups and consisted of areas of granulomatous inflammation with early collagenization (fibrosis). The presence of multinuclear giant cells and the infiltration of macrophages were suggestive of a foreign body type reaction. Interstitial fibrosis was also apparent and was characterized by a thickening of alveolar walls with collagen. Both groups treated with uncalcined aluminas tended to have a higher incidence and severity of granulomas with fibrosis. Although minor pulmonary changes were noted in the aluminium treated groups, these effects were significantly less pronounced than the changes induced by the instillation of the positive control (quartz).

In interpreting these results, it must be considered that large doses were instilled with the intent of overloading normal clearance mechanisms in the lung to exaggerate any reaction that might occur. The dose of 50 mg is equivalent to about 30 mg/g lung, well above the 1 mg/g generally associated with the onset of overloading during long-term studies (<a class="bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/#R970" id="__tag_185977396" rid="R970">Oberdorster et al., 1992</a>).

A dose-dependent minimal and generally transient increase in inflammatory responses was measured in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) including; activity of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) an index of cell membrane damage; beta-glucurnidase and N-acetylglucosaminidase, markers of macrophage/polymorphonuclear membrane damage; and levels of total protein, an index of potential fibrotic activity and/or vascular damage. Increase in total cells at this dose was primarily due to elevation in neutrophils and lymphocytes. At low dose, the only significant change was an increase of neutrophils on day 1 which returned to the control level by day 7. The changes observed at high doses returned slowly to normal values during the 2-month study period. Although intratracheal instillation is not the normal route of exposure, the minimal and generally transient changes induced by Al<sub>2</sub>0<sub>3</sub> are consistent with the lack of significant lung toxicity found in both humans and animals.

No signs of fibrosis were found in any of the animals. No significant changes in alveolar cell concentrations were noted for the group treated with primary aluminium; however the secondary aluminium group exhibited increased concentrations of macrophages and neutrophils one month and one year after exposure. This suggests that fluoride plays an important role in early changes to alveolar cell populations. One year after exposure both the aluminium treated groups exhibited significantly raised concentrations of fibronectin, which indicates that alumina, not fluoride, is essential for this observed effect. The biochemical properties of fibronectin support the formation of an extracellular matrix network, and therefore fibronectin may be an early marker of fibrosis. Due to the administration of aluminium by intratracheal instillation, which is not a physiological route, the results observed in this study need to be confirmed by further investigations in which inhalation is used as a route of exposure.

Malignant mesothelioma was diagnosed in 7 rats in the asbestos group (positive control) and in 3 rats in one of the aluminosilicate groups. However, it must be considered that intra-cavity injections result in a high deposition of the test material directly on the target tissue. This does not reflect inhalation exposures in which the fibres must first be deposited in the alveolar region of the lung and penetrate lung tissue before it reaches the pleural space. The increased mesothelioma proliferation and malignant mesotheliomas detected in the aluminosilicate B group as compared to the aluminosilicate A group is likely a reflection of the size of the fibres. Coarse fibres were found to be more irritating than fine fibres. The results of this study suggest that Saffil alumina fibres are inert and are not associated with mesothelioma induction.

Other data (discussed in <em>Toxicokinetics, Absorption, Animal Studies, Oral Administration, The Site and Mechanisms of Oral Aluminium Absorption</em>) have demonstrated that aluminium absorption occurs in the small intestine by a paracellular pathway process via the tight junctions (<a class="bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/#R461" id="__tag_185977330" rid="R461">Garbossa et al., 1998b</a>; <a class="bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/#R1053" id="__tag_185976437" rid="R1053">Provan &amp; Yokel 1988a</a>).

The aluminium hydroxide-containing vaccine induced a large necrotic area containing damaged muscle fibres and neutrophils, surrounded by abundant lymphocytes and macrophages (days 7-15), that progressed to a mature lesion (21 and 28 days). The focal infiltration of densely packed PAS-positive macrophages, without giant cell formation or muscle fibre damage, was similar to the macrophage infiltrate seen in MMF. Crystalline inclusions similar to those of MMF were detected by electron microscopy. It was proposed that aluminium hydroxide forms a deposit which damages the injected tissue, subsequently eliciting a signal from stressed cells. This signal attracts inflammatory and antigen presenting cells and the aluminium hydroxide deposit is then subject to phagocytosis (<a class="bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/#R75" id="__tag_323627329" rid="R75">Balouet et al., 1997</a>; <a class="bibr popnode" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/#R630" rid="R630">IPCS, 1997</a>; <a class="bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/#R1161" id="__tag_185977253" rid="R1161">Schijns, 2000</a>).

Two groups of 12 male monkeys received a single i.m. injection of either aluminium phosphate adjuvant diphtheria-tetanus vaccine or aluminium hydroxide adjuvant diphtheria-tetanus vaccine. Four monkeys from each of the two groups were sacrificed 85, 169, or 366 days after the single i.m. injection, and macroscopic examination of the injected site was performed to detect any sign of local intolerance. Macrophage aggregation was graded as moderate to marked and was accompanied by a lymphoid infiltration in all cases following the initial sacrifice. Analysis of the injection site revealed high aluminium content for both aluminium treated vaccine groups; however, the aluminium concentration of the reactive zones of animals treated with aluminium hydroxide was 4 times higher than in those treated with aluminium phosphate. The size of the inflammatory lesion was greater in the monkeys given the aluminium hydroxide adjuvant. Six months after the vaccine injection 3 out of 4 monkeys exhibited appreciable lesions composed primarily of macrophages. One of the lesions had an extensive cyst-like structure which contained degenerate macrophages. Two of 4 monkeys in the aluminium hydroxide group had persistent macrophages aggregations with associated minor lymphocytic infiltrations one year following the injection. The histological appearance and persistence of the lesion observed at the injection site is similar to the lesions observed in human cases of MMF.

The pigs were injected twice i.m. and slaughtered at about 165 kg weight. Granulomas located within muscular tissue were observed for all the aluminium containing vaccine groups; granulomas were not detected in any of the pigs who received only water. Granulomas were characterized by aggregates of macrophage-derived epithelioid cells, with some containing oval nucleus, a pale pink cytoplasm, and indistinct cell borders. These cells were surrounded by an infiltrate of mixed inflammatory cells, including large multinucleated giant cells, macrophages, lymphocytes, plasma cells and eosinophilic elements. In most samples, multiple granulomas were joined by a unique fibrous shell.

Pyro powder and flaked powder were composed of flake-like particles, and the atomized powder consisted of atomized spherical particles. Aluminium oxide dust was used as a negative control. Two chambers, containing 30 rats and 30 hamsters each, were held at dust concentrations of 100 mg/m<sup>3</sup> of the pyro powder and the atomized metal powder respectively, two additional chambers were held 50 mg/m<sup>3</sup> of the respective powders. Six chambers, each containing 30 rats and 15 guinea pigs, were maintained at dust concentrations of 15 and 30 mg/m<sup>3</sup> respectively, for each of the three types of metallic aluminium powders.

Intratracheal injection of the aluminium powders at different dose levels was also conducted. Pulmonary fibrosis was not apparent following inhalation of the aluminium powders in hamsters and guinea pigs; however scattered small scars resulted from foci of lipid pneumonitis in rats. All three species of animals developed alveolar proteinosis, the severity and extent of which were not consistently or clearly related either to the type of aluminium powder or to the severity of the dust exposure. The alveolar proteinosis resolved spontaneously and the accumulated dust deposits cleared rapidly from the lungs after cessation of exposure. Intratracheal injection of large doses of aluminium powders into rats produced focal pulmonary fibrosis; no fibrosis occurred in the lungs of hamsters following intratracheal injection.

The aluminium retention in the lungs in rats and hamsters exposed to fume was much greater than when exposed to powder. Following exposure to fresh air, aluminium oxide was cleared rapidly from the lungs of the both powder and fume groups. Weight of wet lung, ash and aluminium oxide content of lungs in exposed animals increased. The initial pulmonary tissue response was proliferation of macrophages within alveolar spaces as well as lipoid pneumonia.

Fibrogenic potential was not detected for any of the 5 aluminas used for primary aluminium production, while it was reported that the other 2 samples induced fibrotic lesions. A correlation between cytological and biochemical parameters studied in BALF and the fibrosis determined by histology was not noted for the alumina-treated animals. A persistent inflammatory alveolar reaction was seen in the animals instilled with the alumina samples, which was less severe than the reaction produced by the instillation of quartz.

Treated rats also exhibited a significant decrease in the haemoglobin level, haematocrit index, and serum Fe concentrations in the peripheral blood compared to control rats. The Ca balance in treated rats was significantly less than in the control group and was accompanied by a significant increase in Ca excreted in faeces, correlated with less intestinal absorption. Accumulation of aluminium on the surface of the trabecular bone and a reduction in the skeletal Ca mass (without any changes in the bone Ca resorption rate), were observed in all treated rats; however, there were no differences when expressed as per 100 g body weight. The reduction in bone turnover was accompanied by a lower recovery velocity from calcemia in the aluminium treated group. The fractional reabsorption of P and sodium was significantly lower in treated animals compared to controls.

In pregnant rats, the highest aluminium concentration was found in kidneys while, in non-pregnant animals, the brain had the highest level of aluminium.

Pregnant mice were assigned to receive a diet containing 25, 500, or 1000 μg aluminium lactate/g diet. The experimental diet commenced on day 0 of gestation and continued throughout pregnancy and lactation. Four pups from each litter were selected for further neurobehavioural assessment after weaning. These pups were fed a control diet containing 25 μg aluminium lactate/g. Neither maternal nor reproductive toxicity was detected. Neurobehavioural maturation of the pups was tested on days 8 through 18 with the Wahlsten test battery which included: forelimb and hindlimb grasps, fore- and hindpaw placement on sticks of two widths, vibrissae placing, visual placing, auditory and air puff startle, eye opening, screen grasp, screen cling, and screen climb. The only difference among the aluminium groups in terms of pup toxicity prior to weaning was poor performance in a climbing test in the 1000 μg Al/g diet group. Several significant differences in neurological signs were exhibited between weanlings whose dams were fed control or high aluminium diets; some of these manifestations persisted after a 2 week recovery period from the diet. Foot splay, forelimb and hindlimb grip strengths, and thermal sensitivity (tail removal latency) were associated with higher maternal dietary aluminium levels. These results suggested that maternal dietary exposure to excess aluminium during gestation and lactation resulted in neurobehavioural toxicity in weanling mice even in the absence of maternal toxicity.</p><p id="P501">In a similar experiment, <a class="bibr popnode" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/#R498" rid="R498">Golub et al.

Forelimb grasp strength was influenced by high aluminium exposure during gestation, negative geotaxis was influenced by exposure during lactation, and hindlimb grasp and temperature sensitivity were affected by exposure during both gestation and lactation. Although aluminium exposure during gestation or lactation did not influence brain and liver aluminium concentrations, exposure during lactation resulted in significantly lower manganese and iron concentrations in the liver, and significantly less manganese concentrations in the brain of the pups at weaning.

For studies in animals, the over-riding considerations are dose, mode of administration, speciation of the metal, and measures of outcome. <em>Human Exposure, Total Human Uptake from All Environmental Pathways (Combined Exposure)</em> summarizes the most common sources of human exposure to aluminium. For the majority of individuals, these various sources of exposure result serum concentrations of 1-2 μg of aluminium per Litre of plasma. It is notable that daily doses can be much higher in individuals who use aluminium-based antacids (<a class="bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/#R792" id="__tag_185977467" rid="R792">Lione, 1983</a>). Typically, toxicological studies in rodents utilize doses that are 10-20 times the anticipated human dose. This calculation is based on increased metabolic rates for rodents and is meant to account for differences in the metabolism of the toxin. Therefore, one potential approach to relate experimental studies in rodents, which are most commonly used, to humans is to assume that studies in rodents that achieve serum levels of &gt;10-20 μg/L would mimic normal environmental exposure levels of humans. Studies that achieve higher concentrations of aluminium in serum could be viewed as challenging the animal to determine the toxic potential of the metal.</p><p class="p p-last" id="P512">Investigators have used a variety of routes of exposure, including oral, i.v. injection, and i.p. injection. A variety of aluminium salts have been used in these studies. As discussed in <em>Toxicokinetics</em>, soluble aluminium salts that are introduced into the body are subject to re-speciation with most aluminium in serum being bound to Tf, a minority found as aluminium citrate, and smaller amounts bound to other molecules. Aluminium citrate is usually excreted by the kidney rather quickly, and thus one could expect that Tf would be the major carrier of aluminium into the brain. In CSF, which has higher concentrations of citrate, aluminium dissociates from Tf with the majority bound to citrate. In studies where soluble aluminium salts have been given orally or by injection (i.p. or i.v.), the most likely species of aluminium in brain would be bound to Tf and citrate. In studies where aluminium has been injected directly into the brain there would be also be re-speciation but there would be opportunity for exposure to novel aluminium salts. For the purposes of review, studies involving oral and i.p, or i.v., injection methods of exposure are probably most informative regarding potential effects in humans. Studies in which aluminium salts have been injected directly into the brain have a greater probability of producing non-physiologic effects.</p></div><div class="sec" id="S152"><h3 id="S152title">Alzheimer’s disease</h3><p class="p p-first" id="P513">Studies in both cell culture models and <em>in vivo</em> have clearly established the potential for aluminium to cause significant neurotoxicity. Likewise, well documented cases of encephalopathy associated with long-term dialysis establish a connection between aluminium and neurotoxicity in humans. One of the first proposed consequences of aluminium exposure in humans was an elevated risk of developing AD. AD is defined by both clinical and pathologic symptoms. Clinically, the symptoms include loss of cognitive ability, psychiatric symptoms, and emotional changes, progressing to profound motor dysfunction and death. Pathologically, AD is defined by the presence of senile plaques, composed of fibrillar extracellular deposits of amyloid β peptide, and NFTs, composed of fibrillar intracellular accumulations of hyperphosphorylated tau protein. Several disorders can produce clinical symptoms that overlap with, or duplicate, the clinical symptoms of AD, including frontotemporal dementia and vascular dementia.</p><p id="P514">The scientific literature contains numerous reviews that discuss the extant literature regarding AD and aluminium exposure. The initial lines of evidence linking AD to aluminium exposure were numerous reports of elevated levels of aluminium in the brains of AD patients and an association of aluminium with disease-specific lesions (amyloid senile plaques and NFTs). However, subsequent studies utilizing more sophisticated technology demonstrated that aluminium levels are not particularly elevated in the brains of AD patients, and aluminium is not disproportionately distributed to senile plaques or NFT (<a class="bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/#R807" id="__tag_185976603" rid="R807">Lovell et al. 1993</a>; <a class="bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/#R1456" id="__tag_185976535" rid="R1456">Xu et al., 1992c</a>) (see <a class="fig-table-link figpopup" co-legend-rid="" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2782734/table/T19/" rid-figpopup="T19" rid-ob="ob-T19" target="table"><span>Tables 19</span></a>-<a class="fig-table-link figpopup" co-legend-rid="" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2782734/table/T21/" rid-figpopup="T21" rid-ob="ob-T21" target="table"><span style="position: relative;text-decoration:none;">​<span class="figpopup-sensitive-area" style="left: -0.5em;">-21).</span></span><span>21</span></a>).

Together, these data suggest that aluminium may modulate the expression and, or, processing of APP. If a life-time of constant exposure results in sustained elevations in APP expression or production of amyloid peptide, then increases in amyloid peptide could accelerate the rate of senile plaque formation and hasten the onset of AD (<a class="bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/#R657" id="__tag_185977550" rid="R657">Jankowsky et al., 2004</a>).</p><p id="P516">In a study in which rats were given large doses of aluminium sulphate by oral gavage, <a class="bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/#R352" id="__tag_185977327" rid="R352">El-Rahman (2003)</a> reported histological changes that resemble those found in AD patients. Animals were given daily doses of aluminium ranging from 4.59 to 17 mg/100 g b.w./day for 35 days. The brains of animals receiving the highest doses were reported to have developed both classic amyloid deposits and NFTs in the cortex. The report, however, did not quantify the prevalence of either pathology and relied on histological stains, rather than antibody immunostaining, to define pathology. The highest dose in this study would equate to a daily exposure for humans of 170 mg/kg b.w./day. Unfortunately, serum levels of aluminium were not reported, making if more difficult to assess exposure to tissue. Although this dose is far and above normal exposure levels, humans who take aluminium-containing antacids may be exposed to between 15 and 50 mg/kg b.w./day (<a class="bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/#R792" id="__tag_185976230" rid="R792">Lione, 1983</a>). Therefore the dose used in this study was within the 10 to 20-fold excess that is routinely used in rodent toxicological studies.

Under both conditions, there were significant and robust changes in the ratio of cholesterol to total phospholipids. There were also robust diminutions in membrane fluidity, attributed to the loss of cholesterol.

Moreover, in patients over 60 years of age the degree of AD-related pathology (subclinical levels) in dialysis patients was similar to that in controls. Collectively, these studies in humans support the view that exposure to aluminium poses no direct risk for development of AD. However, caution in over-stating the importance of the data from DAE patients is warranted given the rather small number of highly definitive cases. The animal studies cited above suggest that a life-time of exposure to low doses of aluminium, or exposure to a single-high-dose, might pose a risk for developing AD or contribute to the aetiology of a subset of cases.</p></div><div class="sec" id="S153"><h3 id="S153title">Motor neuron disease</h3><p class="p p-first-last" id="P519">It has been known since 1965 that the rabbit is uniquely vulnerable to aluminium toxicity and produces both clinical and pathologic features of motor neuron disease (<a class="bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/#R713" id="__tag_185977384" rid="R713">Klatzo et al., 1965</a>). Intracisternal (directly into CSF) injection of aluminium salts (chloride, phosphate, maltolate) can be used to cause both acute and chronic neurotoxicity.

One of the major carriers of aluminium in the serum and interstitial fluids is Tf (see <em>Toxicokinetics, Distribution (Including Compartmentalization), Human Studies, Transport in Blood</em>). At physiological pH, aluminium in serum is bound to transferrrin, although less tightly than Fe would be bound. In CSF, higher concentrations of citrate result in significant re-speciation to aluminium citrate (<a class="bibr popnode" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/#R1481" rid="R1481">Yokel, 2001</a>). Uptake of Tf by neural cells involves receptor-mediated endocytosis via the Tf receptor. Indeed, in the CNS, Tf-mediated uptake has recently been used as a molecular means of introducing novel compounds or proteins into the brain. Importantly, receptor-mediated endocytosis would be expected to deliver material to the endosomal and then lysosomal compartments. Hence, in DAE patient, the subcellular distribution of aluminium in neural cells (neurons and cells of the choroid plexus) is consistent with a mode of exposure that involves Tf-mediated delivery to the nervous system. The extent to which aluminium citrate is taken up by neural cells is unclear.</p></div><div class="sec" id="S156"><p></p><h4 class="inline" id="S156title">Rodent models of aluminium toxicity by direct injection </h4><p class="p p-first" id="P521">To bypass limitations of absorption, some investigators have directly i.p. injected aluminium-salts. <a class="bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/#R370" id="__tag_185976407" rid="R370">Esparza et al.

Levels of aluminium in cortex, hippocampus, cerebellum and liver were measured, with only cerebellum and liver showing significant accumulations of aluminium. Levels of aluminium in serum were not reported. Significant reductions in the levels of manganese and copper were found in brain, with no change in Fe in any organ. In this model, the hippocampus showed the largest number of changes indicative of oxidative stress, including increased GSH, increased measures of lipid peroxidation (thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS)), increased levels of oxidized glutathione (GSSG), and increased SOD levels. In the liver, the levels of GSH were similarly increased, however, paradoxically, the levels of lipid peroxidation were lower than control.

Interpretation of the study is somewhat confounded by damage to the brain resulting from instillation of the cannula and from disruption of the BBB, however several findings were revealing. Aluminium was found to distribute readily along white matter tracts and resulted in activation of both astrocytes and microglia at sites distal to the injection site. Although not a mimic of chronic exposure from drinking water or food sources, these data suggest that acute exposure of neural tissues to aluminium salts elicits responses indicative of neurotoxicity.

The pathologic distribution of aluminium in DAE patients, and in some of the animal studies described above, are consistent with Tf-receptor-mediated endocytosis. Free-flow endocytosis of aluminium citrate could produce a similar pattern. Indeed, the pattern of aluminium accumulation in patients suffering from DAE, membrane delineated lysosomal-like structures, is consistent with an endocytic mechanism of uptake. It is unclear as to whether acute exposure to high levels of aluminium salts by direct injection into CNS reasonably simulates the exposures which result from long-term low level intakes via the oral route. In some of the acute exposure studies, aspects of human neurogenerative disease are produced. However, as described above, pathologic analyses of DAE patients do not reveal the pathologies found in AD and other neurodegenerative diseases, including neurofibrillary pathology, symptoms of motor neuron disease (as occurs in rabbits), or senile plaques.

Lowering Ca and Mg in diet induced a greater number of abnormalities in general health and appearance than Al laced diets (with or without manipulation of calcium/magnesium levels). Intracellular accumulations of aluminium were noted. Although it is possible that the levels of other minerals in the diet could influence the toxicity of aluminium, the most informative outcome of this study was that chronically high doses of aluminium did not result in obvious neurodegeneration, profound neuropathology, or clinical symptoms relevant to motor neuron disease. The average 25g mouse consumes about 5 g of food per day (formulated to contain 15.60 mg/g of aluminium).

The only measure by which the workers exposed to aluminium could be distinguished was a small reduction in reaction time (speed to respond to a question or perform a motor task). In all other cognitive measures including intelligence quotient (IQ), verbal intelligence, and the European Neurobehavioral Evaluation System, workers exposed to aluminium were no different from control populations (<a class="bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/#R157" id="__tag_185977317" rid="R157">Buchta et al., 2003</a>).

The whole femur bone aluminium content was higher in the 16 rats given aluminium chloride (176 ± 8.2 ppm/ash compared with the controls (15.4 ± 4.7 appm). A mineralization defect of bone was detected in the rats after 53 days of aluminium treatment, and this increased in severity as the injections were continued. This was marked by an excess of osteoid on the surface of normally mineralized cartilage at the usual site of endochondral ossification. The excess osteoid was typical of osteomalacia with abnormally wide seams and no calcification front. Endochondral ossification was restored to normal, but osteomalacia persisted for up to 49 days after the cessation of treatment.</p><p id="P547"><a class="bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/#R198" id="__tag_185977686" rid="R198">Chan et al.

Aluminium did not appear to have an effect on the levels of any vitamin D metabolites; however, serum concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D and 24,25-dihydroxyvitamin D were reduced as a direct result of uraemia. The nonuraemic aluminium treated animals did not exhibit any significant skeletal changes as compared to the controls. Marrow fibrosis and osteomalacia developed in some of the uraemic, non-aluminium treated animals. However, osteomalacia as defined by (1) an increase in osteoid area (29 ± 13% uraemia + aluminium vs. 3 ± 6% uraemia, no aluminium), (2) an increase in osteoid surface (42 ± 16% vs. 7 ± 11%), and (3) an abnormal pattern of tetracycline uptake at the calcification front, was more severe in uraemic animals treated with aluminium than in untreated uraemic animals.</p><p id="P548"><a class="bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/#R1104" id="__tag_185976526" rid="R1104">Robertson et al.

Male Wistar rats were divided into 5 groups. The first group (n=5) received a low dose of aluminium (i.p. injection 0.1 mg aluminium as aluminium chloride 5days/week), the second group (n=5) received a high dose of aluminium (i.p. injection of 1.0 mg aluminium as aluminium chloride 5 days/week); the control group (n=4) was administered an i.p injection of an equal volume of diluent over the same injection schedule. One group (n=6) of rats underwent partial nephrectomy and received an i.p injection of diluent, and another group (n=5) underwent partial nephrectomy and received an i.p. injection of 1.0 mg aluminium as aluminium chloride 5 days/week. The treatment lasted for 120 days for the control and low dose aluminium group, but for a shorter period (between 90-100 days) for the other three groups due to the need for early sacrifice as a result of high attrition in these groups. The trabecular bone of the ischium and the iliac wing was obtained from each animal and examined histologically; the bone mineralization process was evaluated by double tetracycline labelling. There were no differences in bone parameters between the low dose aluminium group and the controls. In the other three groups, the relative osteoid volume (<em>p</em> &lt; 0.02) and the osteoid seam width (<em>p</em> &lt; 0.001) were significantly increased as compared to the controls. These parameters are indicators of osteomalacia. The number of osteoclasts/mm<sup>2</sup> increased in nephrectomized rats not exposed to aluminium (<em>p</em> &lt; 0.02) and decreased (<em>p</em> &lt; 0.05) in rats with normal renal function exposed to high doses of aluminium. The number of osteoclasts/mm<sup>2</sup> was not significantly different from that of the control level for the aluminium treated nephrectomized rats. Animals with normal renal function given the high dose were the only group to exhibit a decrease in PTH level, which may explain the reduced osteoclast numbers in this group. However, the increase in osteoclasts/mm<sup>2</sup>, as compared to controls (8.13 ± 2.92 vs. 3.93 ± 100 osteoclasts/mm<sup>2</sup>), in the non-exposed renal failure group, compared to the reduction of osteoclasts in the exposed renal failure group (2.34 ± 1.38 osteoclasts/mm<sup>2</sup> vs. 3.93 ± 100 osteoclasts/mm<sup>2</sup>), indicates that aluminium may have a direct toxic effect on osteoclastic activity.</p><p id="P549">Cortical bone growth was measured in rats given aluminium to study the early effects of aluminium on bone (<a class="bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/#R516" id="__tag_185976666" rid="R516">Goodman, 1984</a>). Thirty weanling male rats were assigned to one of three groups: control (n=10), experimental (n=10), or basal (n=10). Rats in the experimental group were given i.p. injections of aluminium chloride (2 mg aluminium, 5 days per week); animals in the control group received an injection of saline vehicle at the same frequency, and the basal animals did not receive any treatment. The treatment period lasted for 44 days. Bone growth was assessed over two consecutive periods of 28 and 16 days in the control and experimental rats, using tetracycline labelling of bone. Rats in the basal group were sacrificed on the first day of the experimental period. Histological measurements in sections of bone obtained from the basal group were interpreted to represent the status of the bone at the beginning of the bone-labelling period in rats from the control and experimental groups. Bone (0.017 ± 0.004 mm<sup>3</sup>/day) and matrix formation (0.017 ± 0.004mm<sup>3</sup>/day) in the experimental group remained at control levels (bone formation: 0.020 ± 0.004, matrix formation 0.02 ± 0.004 mm<sup>3</sup>/day) during the first period of assessment (28 days after treatment initiation); however, both these measurements were significantly lower (<em>p</em> &lt;0.01) than control values at the end of the entire 44 day study (bone formation: 0.014 ± 0.003 mm<sup>3</sup>/day vs. 0.022 ± 0.003mm<sup>3</sup>/day, matrix formation:0.014 ± 0.003mm<sup>3</sup>/day vs. 0.022 ± 0.003mm<sup>3</sup>/day).

Aluminium treatment did not induce a state of osteomalacia as no significant effect on the osteoid width or the mineralization front width was apparent. The results of this study indicate that aluminium reduces bone and matrix formation early in the course of aluminium exposure, prior to the development of histologically apparent osteomalacia. Aluminium may affect matrix synthesis by reducing the total number of active osteoblasts or diminishing the cellular activity of individual osteoblasts.</p><p id="P550"><a class="bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/#R517" id="__tag_185977378" rid="R517">Goodman et al.

Thirty rats underwent partial nephrectomy and were assigned to one of three groups: control, aluminium-treated, or basal control. Thirty additional rats with intact renal function were divided into the same treatment assignments. Aluminium treated rats received i.p. injections of aluminium chloride (AlCl<sub>3</sub>) in saline 5 days/wk for 4 weeks; the aluminium dose was 2 mg/day. Control rats received injections of saline only, according to the same treatment schedule. Bone growth, bone formation, mineralization, and resorption were measured using double tetracycline labelling of bone. Total bone and matrix formation and periosteal bone and matrix formation were reduced in both nephrectomized and normal renal function rats treated with aluminium as compared to the respective controls. Periosteal bone and matrix formation were similarly reduced in both groups. There was no difference in bone parameters between the control rats of the nephrectomized group as compared to the normal renal function control rats; however, total bone, total matrix, periosteal bone, and periosteal matrix formations were all less in the nephrectomized aluminium treated rats as compared to the non-nephrectomized aluminium treated rats. Resorption surface was greater in both aluminium- (1.70 ± 0.41mm vs. 1.33 ± 0.34 mm) and nephrectomized-aluminium-treated (1.87 ± 0.6 mm vs. 165 ± 0.43 mm) rats compared to the respective controls, and resorptive activity at the endosteum was greater (<em>p</em> &lt; 0.05) in the nephrectomized aluminium treated group (12.2 ± 6.3 μm/d) than in the controls (7.9 ± 4.9 μm/d). Serum calcium and phosphorus concentrations were similar in aluminium-treated and control animals, suggesting that PTH secretion was not substantially affected by aluminium administration. Osteomalacia was not detected, but it should be considered that the duration of this study may not have been of sufficient length for this condition to develop. The results of this study suggest that aluminium exerts is toxic effects on bone by acting directly to reduce new bone and matrix synthesis. In addition, it appears that aluminium may act to increase bone resorption. The enhanced effect of aluminium in nephrectomized rats may be a result of increased aluminium accumulation due to an impaired ability to excrete the metal; however, aluminium in bone was not quantified in this study.</p><p id="P551">In order to investigate the effects of aluminium on the vitamin D-dependent mineralization process, aluminium chloride (1 mg/kg) was administered i.v. 3 times per week for 3 weeks to normal (n=5) and vitamin D-deficient (n=5) beagle puppies (<a class="bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/#R1059" id="__tag_185977996" rid="R1059">Quarles et al., 1985</a>). Vitamin deficiency was induced in the 5 dogs by providing a diet deficient in vitamin D and calcium for a period of 15 weeks before treatment initiation. Bone biopsies and plasma were obtained before and after the 3 week treatment period in each group. In the next phase of this study, aluminium chloride administration was continued at a lower dose (1 mg/kg twice a week) and both groups received the diet fortified with calcium and vitamin D. This phase of the study lasted for 11 weeks. The vitamin D deficient dogs displayed biochemical and bone biopsy evidence of osteomalacia before administration of aluminium. Plasma phosphorus, PTH, and 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations did not appear to be affected by the 3 weeks of aluminium administration in either group. However, bone aluminium content increased to a greater extent in the vitamin D-deficient dogs (390 ± 24.3 μg/g) than in the normal dogs (73.6 ± 10.6 μg/g). After 3 weeks of aluminium treatment, the bone histology in both groups revealed changes consistent only with aging. Provision of a calcium/vitamin D replete diet to the deficient dogs, and reduction of aluminium dosage for 11 weeks resulted normalization of their plasma biochemistry and healing of the osteomalacia. The bone aluminium content of the non-vitamin D deficient dogs increased during the additional 11 weeks of aluminium exposure to 151.0 ± 11.3 μg/g as compared to a bone aluminium content of 73.6 ± 10.6 μg/g after 3weeks of exposure. In contrast, the bone aluminium content in the vitamin D deficient dogs decreased from 390 ± 24.3 μg/g to 173.5 ± 5.6 μg/g at the end of the additional 11 weeks of exposure. Histochemical staining for bone aluminium revealed no apparent aluminium in the normal group and, in the vitamin-D deficient group, there was identifiable aluminium at the mineralization fronts after the 3 weeks of treatment. At the end of the 11 weeks of additional exposure staining for aluminium was detectable only in the cement lines, indicating that mineralization occurred over the previous sites of aluminium deposition. The results of this investigation indicate that aluminium accumulates preferentially in pre-existent osteomalacic bone and localizes at the calcification front (osteoid-bone interface). The presence of aluminium at the calcification front did not impair vitamin D-dependent mineralization as remineralization occurred in the bones of the osteomalacic pups following vitamin-D repletion. Osteomalacia did not occur in the normal pups; however, this does not eliminate the possibility that aluminium administration at higher doses or for prolonged periods might cause bone toxicity in these animals. Therefore, although aluminium may have the potential to cause osteomalacia, its presence at mineralization fronts does not appear to be the mechanism through which this occurs.</p><p id="P552"><a class="bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/#R36" id="__tag_185976873" rid="R36">Alfrey et al.

All animals received 1.5 mg/kg aluminium (as AlCl<sub>3</sub>) by i.p. injection 5 days/wk for 79 days. There was a significantly greater (<em>p</em> &lt; 0.001) trabecular bone osteoid area (percent total bone area) in the PTX uraemic group than in the uraemic group (45 ± 9.7% compared to 13.4 ± 10.6%). Plasma calcium levels were significantly higher in the uraemic PTX group (10.7 ± 0.9 mg/dL) and lower in the control PTX group (9.0 ± 0.5 mg/L) than in their respective controls (9.9 ± 0.6 g/L: uraemic group; 9.8 ± 0.3 mg/L: control group), and phosphorus levels were significantly higher in both the PTX uraemic group (9.3 ± 1.5 mg/L) and PTX control group (8.1 ± 0.6mg/L) as compared to the controls (5.9 ± 0.3mg/L). The second study group was comprised of 35 uraemic rats; 8 of these rats had previously undergone selective PTX and were given 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub>. The uraemic PTX animals and 8 of the uaremic animals received 1.5 mg AlCl<sub>3</sub>/kg by i.p. injection 5 days/week for 35 days, and were killed at the end of this treatment period. Aluminium injections were discontinued in the remaining animals, and nine underwent selective PTX at this time. These animals were followed for an additional 30 days. Bone aluminium levels in the animals killed after 35 days were lower (<em>p</em> &lt; 0.05) in the PTX uraemic group than in the uraemic control group (37 ± 7.6 and 47 ± 7.6 mg/kg, respectively). The bone aluminium levels in the uraemic group that underwent PTX after aluminium loading (53 ± 8 mg/kg) and in the uraemic group (48 ± 5.7 mg/kg) 30 days after aluminium discontinuation were not significantly different. The results of this study suggest that PTX affects the compartmentalization of aluminium in bone, especially in animals in a uraemic state. It also appears that PTX may intensify aluminium-induced osteomalacia as the PTX group had significantly greater bone osteoid area than the uraemic group of rats.</p><p id="P553"><a class="bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/#R457" id="__tag_185976630" rid="R457">Galceran et al.

One group of dogs (n=7) was treated i.v. with 0.75 mg aluminium, 5 days a week for 3 months; 7 additional dogs served as controls. At the end of the treatment period, the dogs were killed, and the tibiae were obtained and perfused <em>in vitro</em>. PTH and methylxanthine (an inhibitor of phosphodiesterase) were added to the perfusate. The serum aluminium level was 20.4 ± 2.3 μg/L before treatment, and rose significantly to 206.2 ± 28.3 (<em>p</em> &lt; 0.01) after aluminium administration. No significant difference in PTH levels was detected before and after aluminium treatment. Because PTH acts to stimulate cAMP release from bone, cAMP levels were measured in both groups before and after PTH administration to examine the effect of aluminium on this process. Although the basal cAMP secretion was the same in both groups of dogs, cAMP increased to a peak of 188.2 ± 30.6 pmol/min in the normal dogs vs. 113 ± 8.15 pmol/min in the aluminium treated dogs after PTH was added to the perfusate (<em>p</em> &lt; 0.05). Examination of bone biopsies taken before and after aluminium administration revealed that the number of osteoblasts had decreased 8-fold (<em>p</em> &lt; 0.01) following aluminium treatment. Aluminium treatment led to an increase in the percent total osteoid surface (44.3 ± 4.7% vs. 22.1 ± 4.1%), decreased mineral apposition rate (0.5 ± 0.4 μm/day vs. 1.3 ± 0.2 μm/day), and aluminium deposition at the mineralization front. Despite the decrease in osteoblast number, the histological features of the post aluminium treatment biopsies indicated that aluminium stimulated osteoblastic activity at some point during its administration. This was apparent from the presentation of new woven bone formation in two dogs, and a layer of newly deposited lamellar bone covering all trabecular surfaces in another. Aluminium also appeared to stimulate the activity of fibroblasts as indicated by the presence of extensive marrow fibrosis in five of the treated dogs. These data support the possibility that aluminium is capable of both stimulating and suppressing matrix synthesis at different times throughout the exposure period. Although the levels of PTH were similar in the aluminium exposed and control animals, the decreased generation of cAMP following the addition of PTH to the perfused bones of the aluminium treated group suggests that aluminium may cause bones to be resistant to the effects of PTH.</p><p id="P554"><a class="bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/#R1179" id="__tag_185977742" rid="R1179">Sedman et al.

The rate of mineralized bone formation was also lower in the aluminium-treated group compared to that in the controls at all three sites. However, it was found that, at sites of continued osteoblastic activity, total osteoid production did not differ between the two groups.

Half the rats in each group received daily i.p. injections 10mg Al/kg as aluminium chloride. The other half of the group was given normal saline solution. Weanling rats were sacrificed after 3, 6, or 9 weeks of treatment. The remaining group of weanling rats received injections for 9 weeks, and was allowed to recover for 3 weeks. The adult group received aluminium treatment for 9 weeks. The effects of aluminium on blood serum levels of various compounds, and on aluminium bone content, and rate of bone formation were assessed after intervals of 3, 6, and 9 weeks. The calcium, phosphate, creatinine, and PTH levels were similar in aluminium-treated rats and controls. Aluminium was detectable by histochemical stain after 6 weeks in the aluminium treated animals; however, other bone parameters did not differ significantly at this time between the treated animals and the controls. A decrease in bone formation (measured by tetracycline labelling) on trabecular and endosteal surfaces was apparent by 9 weeks in the aluminium exposed groups.

The treatment period lasted for 16 weeks. Transcortical bone biopsies were taken from each group after 8 weeks and 16 weeks. In both the low and high dose aluminium groups, serum aluminium levels were significantly elevated compared with those of controls, but calcium, or PTH levels were not altered by treatment. Bone biopsies taken at 8 weeks in the low dose group displayed characteristics of a low turnover state, as marked by a reduction of bone resorption (2.6 ± 0.63% vs. 4.5 ± 0.39%) and osteoblast–covered bone surfaces (2.02 ± 0.51% vs. 7.64 ± 1.86%) as compared to the controls. The mineralized bone formation rate was also found to be significantly decreased. Biopsies taken at week 16 of aluminium administration in the low dose group displayed evidence of <em>de novo</em> bone formation, as well as an increase of bone volume (38.9% ± 1.35 vs. 25.2% ± 2.56) and trabecular number (3.56/mm ± 0.23 vs. 2.88 ± 0.11) compared to the controls.

The bone biopsies obtained from the high dose aluminium group at 8 weeks displayed changes similar to those exhibited after 16 weeks of the low dose treatment. <em>De novo</em> bone formation was evidenced by an increase in trabecular number as compared to the controls (3.41 ± 0.18/mm vs. 2.88 ± 0.11/mm) and increased bone volume (36.5 ± 2.38% vs. 25.2 ± 2.56%). Poorly mineralized woven bone accounted for a large proportion of the newly synthesized tissue, comprising 11.5 ± 4.6% of the bone volume.

At the end of the experiment, both tibias from each animal were extracted for the determination of aluminium content, <em>in vitro</em> bone densitometry, and histological analysis. Bone mineral density, measured at the proximal end of the tibia, was found to be significantly higher (&lt;0.05) in the aluminium-treated group (0.292 ± 0.01 g/cm<sup>2</sup>) as compared to the controls (0.267 ± 0.02 g/cm<sup>2</sup>).

No significant differences in serum calcium, phosphorus, creatinine, hydroxyproline, or PTH were apparent between the aluminium-treated and control animals.

(1999)</a> examined the influence of aluminium citrate administration on tibia formation and calcification in the developing chick embryo. Tibia formation and mineralization were assessed by radiology, total bone calcium content, calcium incorporation rate, collagen synthesis rate, bone alkaline phosphatase activity, and serum levels of osteocalcin, procollagen carboxy-terminal propeptide, and PTH. The chick embryos derived from White Leghorn strain eggs were divided into three treatment groups (aluminium citrate, sodium citrate, sodium chloride), and were treated acutely or chronically. Acutely treated embryos received 100 μL of 60 mM aluminium citrate, 60 mM sodium citrate or 0.7% sodium chloride via injections into the air sac of the egg on day 8 of incubation. Chronically treated embryos received a daily 25 μL dose of the solutions beginning on day 8. The embryos were incubated for an additional 2 to 8 days following treatment. Radiographic analysis of the tibias and femurs of the embryos revealed that the mineralization of the aluminium treated animals was less dense and restricted to a shorter length of the mid-diaphysis as compared to the other two groups. The bone calcium content of embryos acutely or chronically administered aluminium and incubated for 10 to 12 days was significantly lower (<em>p</em> &lt; 0.05) compared to that of the other treatment groups. The calcium content of tibias from embryos chronically treated with aluminium remained lower than the controls for 12 day and 16 day embryos while, by day 14, there were no significant differences in the total calcium content from acutely treated embryos compared to the controls. Significantly higher (<em>p</em> &lt; 0.05) levels of alkaline phosphatase activity were found in the tibias collected from embryos chronically treated with aluminium incubated from 12 (2.16 units/tibia/hr vs. 1.32 units/tibia/hr) to 16 days (10.38 units/tibia/hr vs. 6.78 units/tibia/hr) as compared to the sodium chloride control group. Aluminium did not have a significant effect on the rate of tibia collagen, non-collagenous protein synthesis or serum levels of procollagen carboxy terminal propeptide, osteoclacin or PTH. The lack of change in these parameters suggests that embryonic osteoblast number and activity is not markedly diminished by aluminium exposure at these doses. The authors suggested that the observed under-mineralization of the tibias in the aluminium treated embryos may be a manifestation of the production of defective osteoid, an inhibited terminal maturation of osteoblasts, or physiochemical inhibition of mineralization nucleation sites.</p><p id="P561"><a class="bibr popnode" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/#R1513" rid="R1513">Zafar et al. (2004)</a> investigated the effect of chronic exposure to dietary aluminium on calcium absorption and calbindin concentrations in male weanling rats fed various levels of calcium and aluminium for 3 and 6 week periods. One group of rats (n=40) was fed a calcium adequate diet, three other groups of 40 animals each were fed a calcium-deficient diet with 0, 0.05 or 0.1% aluminium, as aluminium chloride. After 3 weeks, 20 rats per group were fasted overnight and 10 rats per group were given an oral dose of 25 mg calcium labelled with 6 μCi <sup>45</sup>Ca by gavage. The other 10 rats in each group were given 6 μCi <sup>45</sup>Ca as an interperitoneal injection. Rats were anaesthetized the following day, blood was collected and the femurs were obtained. The remaining animals (20 per group) were switched to a calcium adequate diet containing the same level of aluminium they had been fed previously, and were maintained on these new diets for another 3 weeks. No difference in <sup>45</sup>Ca absorption was observed among the 4 groups at either 3 or 6 weeks. Aluminium supplementation at 0.05 and 0.1% of the diet reduced calbindin concentrations (compared to the group receiving a calcium deficient diet without aluminium). Total bone calcium decreased with aluminium supplementation. The bone calcium content was significantly different (<em>p</em> &lt; 0.05) in the calcium deficient-no aluminium group, and in the calcium deficient groups supplemented with 0.05 and 0.1% aluminium, as compared to the calcium adequate group at both 3 and 6 weeks of treatment. In addition, the bone calcium content was significantly lower (<em>p</em> &lt; 0.05) in the calcium deficient, 0.1% aluminium group as compared to all the other groups. Aluminium treatment reduced the breaking strength parameters of the bones from rats on the calcium-deficient diets. When the animals were switched to a calcium adequate diet for 3 weeks, there were no differences in the resistance to breaking due to aluminium intake. The results of this study suggest that dietary aluminium has detrimental effects on bone quality when calcium is deficient.</p><p class="p p-last" id="P562"><a class="bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/#R227" id="__tag_185978000" rid="R227">Cointry et al. (2005)</a> analyzed the effects of aluminium accumulation on whole-bone behaviour in rats. Rats (n=14) received i.p. doses of 27mgAl/day, as aluminium hydroxide (Al(OH)<sub>3</sub>), for a period of 26 weeks. Fourteen control rats received a 20% glycerol/water solution at the same dosing schedule. At the end of the experimental period, the left tibiae was obtained from each animal for bone ash determination. Both femurs from each animal were also dissected and examined for the volumetric mineral density of the cortical bone region and for cross-sectional properties of the cortical bone region. Mechanical testing of the femurs was also conducted. The Young’s modulus of elasticity (a measure of stiffness) was calculated, as well as the stress of the cortical tissue at the yield point, which is an indicator of the tissue’s ability to support loads before any crack initiation. Aluminium concentration was significantly higher (<em>p</em> &lt; 0.001) in the tibias of treated animals (103 ±18 μg/g) as compared to those of control animals (6 ±1 μg/g). The volumetric bone mineral density was significantly reduced in the treated animals with respect to the controls. Up to the yield point, the structural stiffness and strength of the bones did not differ between groups; however, an aluminium-induced impairment of the ability to resist loads beyond the yield point was observed. Treatment had a negative impact on the bending stiffness (Young’s elastic modulus) and the yield stress of cortical bone. These parameters were decreased by 18 and 13% respectively in treated animals as compared to those of controls (<em>p</em>&lt; 0.05). The cortical second moment of inertia, which is a measure of the architectural efficiency of the cortical bone, was significantly improved in aluminium-treated rats (+10% change, <em>p</em> &lt;0.01) as compared to that of the control group. This suggests that an adaptive response to aluminium treatment may have caused an improvement of the spatial distribution of the available cortical tissue resulting in an enhanced ability of the bone to resist anterior-posterior bending. The results of this study suggest that the apparent adaptive response of the bone to aluminium may have maintained normal stiffness and strength, but aluminium may have reduced the ability of the bone to resist loads beyond the yield point, or the ultimate strength of the bone.</p></div><div class="sec" id="S160"><h3 id="S160title">Mineral Metabolism</h3><p class="p p-first" id="P563">The effects of aluminium on metabolic parameters in humans are not well understood.

The authors did not report the levels of aluminium in serum or bone, so it is difficult to assess the relative exposures of the animals. The amounts of aluminium in the water were roughly 10,000 times the average exposure level of humans and the addition of citrate would likely have increased absorption. Under these conditions, for each trace element, there were statistically significant effects of aluminium for multiple tissues; however, there were not always dose-dependent responses and the response of young vs. older animals sometimes differed. Among the most striking changes were the 25 to 50% reductions in calcium levels in kidney and brain of the mid and old age groups given the highest dose of aluminium. In young animals given the highest dose, however, the levels of calcium in these organs were ~2-fold higher than in those of controls.

As described below, Tf and iron are crucial regulators of erythropoiesis; thus an immediate suggestion of a mechanism behind anaemia in patients afflicted with renal failure is evident that implicates aluminium.</p><p class="p p-last" id="P584">However, in the majority of these patients, treatment with erythropoietin, a hormonal stimulator of haematopoiesis, is effective in restoring haematocrits (percentage of cells in whole blood that are red blood cells), at least partially (<a class="bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/#R367" id="__tag_185976585" rid="R367">Eschbach et al., 2002</a>; <a class="bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/#R1143" id="__tag_185976800" rid="R1143">Sakiewicz &amp; Paganini, 1998</a>). In most patients, one physiological basis of anaemia stems from compromised production of erythropoietin by diseased kidneys, leading to chronic anaemia. The condition is often exacerbated by iron deficiency, which can arise from decreased red blood cell <em>t<sub>½</sub></em>, chronic loss of blood, decreased uptake, and other nutritional deficiencies (<a class="bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/#R328" id="__tag_185976353" rid="R328">Drüeke, 2001</a>; <a class="bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/#R1143" id="__tag_185976748" rid="R1143">Sakiewicz &amp; Paganini, 1998</a>; <a class="bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/#R1443" id="__tag_323627404" rid="R1443">Winearls, 1998</a>). In the majority of haemodialysis patients, treatments with erythropoietin and iron supplements are sufficient to raise haematocrits to levels &gt;30% of normal, a level that alleviates most symptoms of anaemia. Although some patients are hyporesponsive to erythropoietin, the levels of iron-saturated Tf and aluminium do not provide a correlative explanation (<a class="bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/#R367" id="__tag_185977522" rid="R367">Eschbach et al., 2002</a>); unresponsive patients do not have higher serum levels of aluminium or lower levels of iron saturated Tf. Thus, in patients who are exposed to high levels of aluminium, the physiological basis for anaemia is complex and involves, at least in part, a loss of hormonal stimulation. However, as outlined below, there are both cell culture and animal model data to indicate that aluminium has the capacity of perturb haematopoiesis and thus effects on this system should be considered in assessing aluminium toxicity.</p></div><div class="sec" id="S164"><h3 id="S164title"><em>In vivo</em> animal studies</h3><p class="p p-first" id="P585">The effects of aluminium on haematopoiesis have been investigated in various animal models.

(1999)</a>, direct evidence that aluminium inhibits erythroid differentiation was reported. Erythroid progenitor cells were concentrated from human blood and exposed to 100 μmol aluminium citrate (8 mg/L elemental aluminium) for 10 days and induced to differentiate with erythropoietin. The authors reported 30% reductions in CFU-E activity. However, in a similar study, <a class="bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/#R893" id="__tag_185976337" rid="R893">Mladenovic (1988)</a> reported that aluminium at levels of 1,035 ng/mL (1.035 mg/L) in medium did not significantly diminish CFU-E. However, if Tf was added to the medium along with aluminium, then CFU-E was diminished by 90%. If Tf was first saturated with iron, aluminium had no effect. The negative effects of Tf-aluminium were not overcome by adding excess levels of erythropoietin. One conclusion that could be drawn from this study was that a primary effect of aluminium on erythroid differentiation was mediated by competition for the Tf receptor. If excess Tf saturated with aluminium is present, then erythroid differentiation is inhibited by the binding of aluminium-metallated-Tf (aluminoxamine) to its receptor. However, the affinity of Tf for iron is 5 orders of magnitude greater than its affinity for aluminium. Hence excess aluminium alone cannot displace the iron from Tf-iron complexes that pre-exist in culture medium. Adding demetallated Tf to the medium allows aluminium to bind and thus creates the opportunity for Tf-aluminium-complexes to compete for binding to the Tf receptor. The extent to which a similar scenario may occur <em>in vivo</em> depends upon the levels of free Tf in serum at the time of aluminium exposure and on the level of iron in the serum. If sufficient iron is present, then aluminium binding to Tf would be less favoured. Individuals with iron deficiency could therefore be at greater risk for developing haematopoietic abnormalities upon exposure to aluminium.</p><p class="p p-last" id="P592">Direct effects of aluminium salts on the morphology of red blood cells have been reported (<a class="bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/#R1286" id="__tag_185976556" rid="R1286">Suwalsky et al., 2004</a>; <a class="bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/#R1399" id="__tag_185977415" rid="R1399">Vittori et al., 2002</a>; <a class="bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/#R1517" id="__tag_185977411" rid="R1517">Zatta et al., 1997</a>). However, as outlined above in <em>Effects on Laboratory Mammals and In Vitro Test Systems, Neurotoxicity</em>, most studies of aluminium metabolism indicate that most of the aluminium, absorbed from drinking water or food, present in plasma would be bound to Tf.

Asthma-like symptoms, known as “<em>potroom asthma</em>” have been reported in several studies. The exact cause of potroom asthma has not been conclusively established, but hydrogen fluoride and particulate fluoride have been implicated (<a class="bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/#R81" id="__tag_185976519" rid="R81">Barnard et al., 2004</a>; <a class="bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/#R1244" id="__tag_185976468" rid="R1244">Soyseth &amp; Kongerud, 1992</a>). <a class="bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/#R1070" id="__tag_185976959" rid="R1070">Radon et al.

A detailed review of studies (in chronological order) follows.</p><p id="P656">A cross-sectional respiratory survey of white males conducted from October 1979 to May 1980 at an aluminium smelter in British Columbia (<a class="bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/#R199" id="__tag_185976649" rid="R199">Chan-Yeung et al., 1983</a>) compared the results in 797 potroom workers, 495 with high exposure (who spent more than 50% of their working time in the potroom) and 302 with medium exposure (who spent less than 50% of their working time in the potroom), with 713 men with no significant exposure to air contaminants (who worked in the office and casting departments). There were two components to the study, a health study and an industrial hygiene survey. For the health study, trained interviewers administered a questionnaire using a standardized technique; data on smoking habits and detailed occupational history were collected. A limited physical examination was conducted, including respiratory symptoms, and tests for common skin allergens. Chest roentgenograms were obtained (from 60% of workers), and pulmonary function tests were conducted. To determine if work place exposure to contaminants had acute effects on the airways, pre-shift and post-shift spirometry was conducted on a subset of the medium and high exposure groups. In addition, pre-shift, post-shift and end of the work week urine samples were collected to measure urinary fluoride levels. The industrial hygiene survey involved personal sampling on representative workers of different job categories for levels of air contaminants, including total airborne particulates, gaseous and particulate fluoride, carbon monoxide, sulphur dioxide and benzo-alpha-pyrene. Highly exposed potroom workers were significantly younger, were employed for significantly shorter periods of time, and were more likely to smoke than the control group. Potroom workers had a greater prevalence of cough, sputum, and wheeze compared with the control group; these results were statistically significant for the high exposure group but not for the medium exposure group. Less than 10% of the workers who had a chest radiograph exhibited abnormal findings; most of these changes were determined to have resulted from previous pulmonary tuberculosis. Chest radiographs revealed the presence of diffuse reticulonodular shadows in 28 workers with no association with any particular group. When pulmonary function was adjusted for age, height, duration of employment and smoking, potroom workers in the high exposure category were found to have significantly lower mean FEV<sub>1</sub> and lower maximal mid-expiratory flow rate. The same result was observed in the medium exposure group, but was not statistically significant. Pulmonary function was lower when measured post-shift as compared to the pre-shift measurement in both potroom and control workers. Urinary fluoride levels increased in potroom workers after one shift, while the control group exhibited a slight decrease in urinary fluoride levels after one shift. Results from personal samplers revealed that potroom workers were exposed to higher levels of air contaminants (total particulate, fluoride, carbon monoxide, sulphur dioxide, and benzo-alpha-pyrene) than the controls. These results suggest that the increased frequency of adverse pulmonary effects seen in the potroom workers, compared with the controls, may be a result of the irritant properties of the air contaminants on the potline. Although no cases of asthma were detected in the potroom workers, five workers in the control group indicated that they left the potroom as a result of asthma. In interpreting the results of this study, it must be considered that only 60% of the sample received chest radiographs. In addition, the article states that many of the workers had previously been miners which could have had an impact on the workers= current pulmonary status.</p><p id="P657">The possible role of atopy in the occurrence of acute bronchoconstrictive impairment was investigated in a cross-sectional study of 227 workers using the Alu-Swiss process for the electrolytic extraction of aluminium (<a class="bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/#R1152" id="__tag_185977414" rid="R1152">Saric et al., 1986</a>). Subjects underwent an examination which consisted of an interview regarding respiratory symptoms and history of atopy, measurement of FEV<sub>1</sub>, and intradermal skin testing with common allergens. Bronchial hyperreactivity was assessed using non-specific bronchoprovocative tests with histamine or methacholine. The fraction of workers diagnosed with atopy was within the expected range. Seven workers exhibited signs of paroxysmal wheezing and dyspnoea. Three of these workers had a positive skin test, but only one worker had increased IgE levels. Bronchoprovocative tests with histamine or methacholine indicated the presence of bronchial hyperreactivity in five of these workers. These results suggest that bronchial hyperreactivity is an important mechanism in the occurrence of acute respiratory impairment. Atopy did not appear to be associated with the asthma-like symptoms.</p><p id="P658"><a class="bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/#R967" id="__tag_185976998" rid="R967">O’Donnell et al. (1989)</a> reported on 57 cases of potroom asthma at an aluminium smelter from early 1971 to the end of 1986. Beginning in 1982, subjects’ symptoms were diagnosed at biennial medical examinations. When asthma was suspected, the subject underwent skin tests to assess background atopy, blood eosinophil count, serum IgE concentration, a progressive incremental exercise test, and the measurement of nonspecific bronchial reactivity to methacholine. All employees had regular chest X-rays. Thirty-one subjects had been diagnosed with asthma prior to the study commencement in 1982, when these employees were assessed in detail for the first time. All subjects were transferred from potrooms to other areas of the smelter after diagnosis. From 1982, subjects underwent annual physical examination, spirometry and assessment of non-specific bronchial reactivity. Subjects were followed until the end of 1986. Seventeen of the 57 subjects tested positive for atopy, and 34 subjects exhibited nonspecific bronchial hyperreactivity to methacholine. The majority of workers showed improvement of symptoms during the first 2 years after diagnosis and transfer from the potrooms. However, deterioration of symptoms, as assessed by return to abnormal nonspecific bronchial reactivity, was noted in several subjects. Forty-three subjects were available for review in 1986. Twelve reported frequent or persistent symptoms of asthma, and a further 11 were taking some regular medication for intermittent symptoms of asthma. Persistence of symptoms may be a reflection of the severity of the asthma. It is possible that workers affected more severely also experienced persistent epithelial damage or continuing inflammatory changes due to irritant particulate in the airways. It should be noted that 16 of the 31 subjects diagnosed with asthma had been transferred from potroom work prior to the detailed functional assessment in 1982. These patients had time to recover from the potroom exposure, and the baseline symptom measurements may not reflect their symptoms at the time of diagnosis. This was essentially a monitoring of the respiratory health of potroom workers with a view to moving those who were adversely affected to different jobs, rather than an epidemiological study.</p><p id="P659"><a class="bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/#R814" id="__tag_185976956" rid="R814">Mackay et al.

Data were collected from 33 asthmatic (23 prevalent cases, 10 incident cases) and 127 non-asthmatic potroom workers stratified by age and length of service. Subjects were tested for atopy (positive wheal and flare response to environmental antigens), serum Ig levels, autoantibodies, and antinuclear antibodies. The genetic markers assessed included typing for ABO blood groups, and standard microcytotoxicity for A and B locus human leucocyte antigens for histocompatibility testing. Sixty-four percent of the asthmatic workers had a background of atopy while the remaining 36% of the group did not. Of the asthmatics who were atopic, 48% had elevated IgE levels; however, the difference in frequency of IgE levels greater than 100 IU/mL was not significant between the asthmatic and the nonasthmatic group. No other major differences in Ig levels, genetic markers, frequency of antinuclear or other autoantibodies were noted between the case and control groups. The results of this study suggest that the immune parameters and genetic markers assessed did not have a significant impact on the risk of developing aluminium smelter-related asthma.</p><p id="P660">Respiratory symptoms and lung function were examined in 1,679 male and 126 female potroom workers from seven Norwegian aluminium reduction plants (<a class="bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/#R729" id="__tag_185977782" rid="R729">Kongerud et al., 1990</a>; <a class="bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/#R730" id="__tag_323627489" rid="R730">1994</a>; <a class="bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/#R728" id="__tag_185976577" rid="R728">Kongerud &amp; Samuelsen, 1991</a>).

Self-administered questionnaires were employed to record workers= symptoms of dyspnoea, wheezing and cough during the previous year. Information about allergy, smoking habits, former work exposure, length of employment in the potrooms, duration of symptoms and use of airway protection was also recorded. FEV<sub>1</sub> and FVC was measured by spirometry. Personal samplers were used to obtain measurements of total airborne dust and total fluorides.

This analysis, which covered 1,760 members of the active work force during this period, demonstrated a significant association between length of potroom employment and the presence of work-related asthma. Work-related asthmatic symptoms occurred in 15% of the workers with an exposure period of 10 years or more, and in 8% of the workers who had been employed for less than 5 years. The odds ratio (OR) for asthmatic symptoms was 3.44 (95% CI: 2.06-5.76) for workers employed for 10 years or more compared to workers exposed for less than five years after controlling for sex, age, familial disposition for asthma, allergy, smoking, and use of airway protection. Airflow limitation was also significantly higher for workers employed for over 10 years as compared to those employed for less than 5 years (OR= 2.6, 95% CI: 1.68-3.85).</p><p id="P662">A prospective study of the respiratory health in Norwegian aluminium potroom workers was also conducted of newly enrolled workers who were examined on at least 2 occasions from January 1, 1986 to December 31, 1989 (<a class="bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/#R728" id="__tag_185977739" rid="R728">Kongerud &amp; Samuelsen, 1991</a>). Dyspnoea and wheezing were reported by 105 of the 1301 workers during the follow-up. Symptomatic and asymptomatic workers did not differ in FEV<sub>1</sub> or FVC measurements. The probability of developing symptoms was 7% for people who had never smoked, and 23% for those who currently smoked, during the first 2 years of employment. Smoking and total fluoride exposure were determined to be the most important predictors of development of dyspnoea and wheezing, based on proportional hazards regression analysis. The incidence of respiratory symptoms was highest in the first year of work and appeared to decrease after two years of exposure. The estimated probability for the development of symptoms was approximately 20% after 4 years of exposure. Proportional hazard ratios by smoking status compared to those who never smoked were: ex-smokers 4.39 (95% CI: 1.30-14.82), low 2.19 (1.23-3.91), and high 3.29 (1.72-6.29). Compared to the lowest level of fluoride exposure of 0-0.4 mg/m<sup>3</sup>, the hazard ratio for 0.41-0.8 mg/m<sup>3</sup> was 3.35 (1.51-7.41), and for &gt;0.8 mg/m<sup>3</sup> was 5.20 (2.02-13.34).

Selection criteria included having had initial occupational exposure to asbestos at least 15 years previously, and a duration of exposure of 5 years. The controls were volunteers who may not have been representative of their occupation, but their age, height, weight and smoking status were well matched with the aluminium refinery workers. Both groups were exposed to asbestos. The referent group was also exposed to ferrous metal welding and copper brazing, but not aluminium. Six hundred and seventy aluminium workers and 659 controls were included in this analysis. Subjects completed health questionnaires, received a physical chest examination, and chest radiograph. Spirometry was performed and alveolar carbon monoxide was measured. The prevalence of reported asthma was 13.5% in the aluminium exposed group as compared to 8.7% in the comparison group (<em>p</em> &lt; 0.05). Wheezing heard at the physical examination was also significantly higher in the aluminium workers (32%) as compared to the pipefitters (11.8%). The prevalence of chronic bronchitis was equal between the two groups. The occurrence of irregular opacities in the lung was higher in the aluminium workers, and the pattern of these irregularities differed from that of the regional controls. The prevalence of asthma in non-smoking workers was 7.6% for the aluminium group and 4.0% for the controls; wheezing was detected in 21.4% of non-smoking aluminium workers compared to 2.4% of non-smoking controls. Asthma prevalence was 16.4% for aluminium workers who were current smokers vs. 9.4% in the referent group, and wheezing was heard in 43.7% of aluminium workers who were current smokers compared with 21.1% in the controls. These results suggest that aluminium workers had significantly more asthma, wheezing, airway obstruction and pulmonary parenchymal abnormalities than did a control group of a similar socio-economic status and type of employment not involving exposure to aluminium. Due to the lack of industrial hygiene measurements of exposure to gases, fumes, and other particulates, it is difficult to speculate on whether a specific agent was responsible for the higher occurrence of asthma in the aluminium workers. The differences in mean pulmonary function values were not attributed to asbestos because both groups had similar rates of exposure and prevalence of asbestosis. It is possible that systematic differences in terms of lifestyle and other previous exposures between the two groups of workers might have been responsible for the differences in respiratory symptoms.</p><p id="P664"><a class="bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/#R1242" id="__tag_185976466" rid="R1242">Sorgdrager et al. (1995)</a> conducted a nested case control study in two Dutch aluminium production plants in order to identify workers with an increased risk of developing potroom asthma. The cases and controls from this study were drawn from two aluminium smelter plants. The first group contained workers employed in plant A between 1978 and 1988; the second consisted of workers from plant B employed between 1971 and 1991. Cases were defined as potroom workers who were unable to work because of respiratory symptoms, and who met clinical criteria for potroom asthma. These cases were identified through worker consultation with the occupational health officer for respiratory complaints, or through periodic medical examinations. Cases were matched to controls (co-workers who did not have potroom asthma) based on age and year of employment commencement. In Plant A, 57 out of 300 workers were diagnosed with potroom asthma, while 174 of 1,208 employees were diagnosed with potroom asthma in plant B. After the matching process, 182 case-control pairs were identified from the two plants combined and included in the analysis. Subjects underwent pre-employment examinations which included spirometry, bronchial responsiveness, and blood eosinophil count. Leucocyte count was also obtained from workers in plant B. Lung function did not differ between the cases and controls in plant A. In plant B only, FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC was significantly lower in cases than in controls at pre-employment examination. Pre-employment eosinophil counts were significantly higher in cases than in controls in the workers of both plants (OR = 1.28, <em>p</em> = 0.0002 controlling for childhood respiratory problems, positive family history, smoking and lung function). These results suggest that the development of potroom asthma is not related to lung function or bronchial responsiveness before employment. Elevated blood eosinophil count may be a risk factor for potroom asthma for workers without clinical signs of respiratory disease prior to employment. The authors suggested that the combined effects of fluoride exposure with elevated eosinophil counts might induce an immunological or cytotoxic process.</p><p id="P665">Three hundred and seventy aluminium potroom workers in a Norwegian plant participated in a cross-sectional survey to assess bronchial responsiveness, lung function, and respiratory symptoms in relation to occupational exposure to air contaminants in the potroom (<a class="bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/#R1244" id="__tag_185978085" rid="R1244">Soyseth &amp; Kongerud, 1992</a>). Three hundred and thirty-seven subjects completed a questionnaire regarding respiratory symptoms within the previous year, familial asthma, smoking habits, and years of employment in the potrooms. Work related asthmatic symptoms were defined as dyspnoea and wheezing which improved during absence from work. Lung function tests and methacholine challenge for bronchial responsiveness were conducted. An estimate of exposure to dust and fluorides was made for each worker based on job specific exposure measurements and personal sampling equipment. Adjusted ORs were statistically significantly elevated for subjects exposed to total fluorides above 0.5 mg/m<sup>3</sup> compared to workers exposed to total fluorides at concentrations less than 0.5 mg/m<sup>3</sup>, for dyspnoea only, dyspnoea and wheezing, cough and work-related asthmatic symptoms. The equivalent ORs for dust exposure were not elevated. These findings suggest that exposure to fluorides may be an important determinant of work related asthmatic symptoms in potroom workers. However, it should be considered that bronchial responsiveness and spirometry, which are more objective measures of respiratory function, were not associated with exposure to fluorides or dust. Therefore, it is possible that the positive association between exposure to fluoride and respiratory symptoms is a spurious result because of over-reporting of symptoms in the high exposure group, misclassification of exposure, or selection bias.</p><p id="P666"><a class="bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/#R1245" id="__tag_323627391" rid="R1245">Søyseth et al.

Subjects were tested for bronchial responsiveness and blood samples were obtained and analysed for fluoride levels every third month for two years. A positive association was found between bronchial responsiveness and plasma fluoride levels. This result contrasts with the finding of a negative association between fluoride exposure and bronchial responsiveness from the previous cross-sectional survey in the same plant (<a class="bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/#R1244" id="__tag_185976616" rid="R1244">Soyseth &amp; Kongerud, 1992</a>). The differences between these two studies may be a reflection of their study designs. Selection bias is a concern in cross-sectional studies; in a longitudinal design subjects serve as their own controls which allows selection bias to be minimized. However, the small size of the longitudinal study may limit its value; for example, such a small subset of aluminium potroom workers may not be representative of potroom workers in general. It is also possible that fluoride levels serve as a marker for another non-fluoride containing agent that is present in the potroom and correlated with fluoride levels.</p><p id="P667">The bronchial responsiveness of the 26 members of the index group was also compared to that of 12 aluminium potroom workers who were relocated due to their work-related asthmatic symptoms (<a class="bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/#R1246" id="__tag_185977115" rid="R1246">Soyseth et al., 1995</a>). A decrease in bronchial responsiveness during the follow-up visits occurred in both groups; however, the decline appeared to be greater for the relocated workers. Subjects who were most reactive at inclusion experienced the largest improvement in bronchial responsiveness during the follow-up. The results of this study indicate that removal of potroom workers from the exposure causes a decrease in bronchial responsiveness. However, the subjects who were relocated were more likely to have more severe symptoms than the non-relocated workers. Thus the observed decrease in bronchial responsiveness may be, in part, due to regression to the mean. This phenomenon refers to the tendency of severe symptoms to naturally decline towards normal levels. Again, the small number of participants in this study may mean that the results cannot be generalised to other potroom workers.</p><p id="P668"><a class="bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/#R1247" id="__tag_323627389" rid="R1247">Søyseth et al.

Of the 379 potroom workers who completed a respiratory questionnaire in the cross-sectional survey, 26 men met the inclusion criteria for the study which was age under 60 years and normal lung function during symptom free periods. A reference group was comprised of new male employees who reported no respiratory symptoms on the questionnaire. The subjects were examined at regular intervals over a period of two years. At each interval, subjects were asked to record the frequency and severity of dyspnoea, wheezing and coughing. FEV<sub>1</sub> and bronchial responsiveness was also measured. Eight subjects in the index group shifted between bronchial hyperresponsiveness and normal bronchial responsiveness, while the degree of bronchial response did not vary for any of the subjects in the reference group. In addition, it was found that the variability of bronchial responsiveness was positively associated with mean symptom scores. One possible limitation of this study is the difference between the index group and the reference group in age (mean of 38.1 in the index group vs. 25.3 in the reference group), duration of employment, and smoking habits. However, the authors stated that neither age nor duration of employment were determinants of bronchial responsiveness in a previous experiment. The observations from this small longitudinal study indicate that severity of symptoms in aluminium potroom workers with work related asthma reflects the variability in bronchial responsiveness.</p><p id="P669">The effect of exposure to potroom pollutants on the development of lung function in potroom workers was investigated in an additional longitudinal study by <a class="bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/#R1248" id="__tag_185976321" rid="R1248">Søyseth et al.

Exposure to particulates increased the decline in FEV<sub>1</sub>. It was found that the decline in FEV<sub>1</sub> accelerated with age and smoking.

The data used for this analysis originated from employment history, clinical history and some exposure measurements for 179 potroom workers (contributing 2,845 person years) who developed work-related respiratory disease between 1970 and 1990. This period was divided into three segments. No exposure data were available during period 1, (1970-1975). For period 2, (1976-1981), exposure data based on determination of fluoride in urine samples were available. In the third period (1982-1990) the HPT was incorporated in the pre-employment medical examination. After the introduction of the HPT as a selection tool in pre-employment screening, the incidence density of potroom asthma decreased from 11.6 (period 2) to 2.5 (period 3). However, potroom asthma was also shown to occur in employees with normal bronchial responsiveness. In addition, there was no difference in time lag for the cases occurring before and after introduction of the HPT. This suggests that potroom exposure acts as an inducer of hyper-responsiveness. The decrease in fluoride levels in the aluminium plant between period 2 and period 3 may have contributed to the decrease of potroom asthma observed.</p><p id="P671"><a class="bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/#R442" id="__tag_185978020" rid="R442">Fritschi et al.

Spirometry was performed on all subjects; FEV<sub>1</sub> and FVC were recorded. Skin prick tests to common allergens were also performed to determine atopic status. Employees were divided into groups according to the type and area of work at the time of the survey. Employees in administrative type jobs were considered to be unexposed. Mean time-weighted averages were available for some job titles from the two different plants. Multiple logistic regression analysis was performed with each of the four work-related symptoms (wheeze, chest tightness, shortness of breath, and rhinitis) as outcomes. The participants from the two smelters completed an interview. Workers in the ingot process group in Smelter A had about 5 times greater odds (after adjusting for smoking and age) of reporting each of the work-related symptoms compared to the administration group. The odds of reporting work-related wheeze and chest tightness was approximately three times greater in the anode and potroom groups than in the administration group. The ingot workers in Smelter B had approximately 3 times greater odds of work-related wheeze, and potroom employees had 3.5 times the odds of work-related rhinitis, compared to the unexposed group. Rhinitis was the only symptom reported more commonly by the potroom employees than by the administration employees in smelter B. The likelihood of reporting work-related symptoms increased with duration of work in the potrooms, while ingot mill workers and anode process workers were more likely to report symptoms within the first year of work. The differences in results between the potrooms in the two different smelters may be a reflection of the age of the smelter, the type of respiratory equipment used, or the selection process for employees at the two different plants. Another major difference between the two smelters was that Smelter A produced alloy while Smelter B did not. The results of cross-sectional studies must be interpreted cautiously as selection and survival bias is often inherent in this type of design. Subjects who left the company as a result of their symptoms would not have participated in this study.</p><p id="P672"><a class="bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/#R1070" id="__tag_185977744" rid="R1070">Radon et al. (1999)</a> conducted a cross-sectional survey in a German aluminium smelter to investigate the combined influence on respiratory health of smoking and exposure in an aluminium potroom. Seventy-eight smelter employees participated in this survey (23 never smokers, 38 current smokers, and 17 ex-smokers). Fifty-seven laboratory, workshop and gate workers (18 non-smokers, 22 current smokers, and 17 ex-smokers) from within the plant served as controls. Information regarding respiratory symptoms during the preceding year, smoking habits, medical and occupational history was collected in standardized interviews. Spirometry tests were preformed for all subjects. Potroom workers who were current smokers at the time had the lowest prevalence of respiratory symptoms, while, respiratory symptoms in controls tended to be highest in those who were smokers. No effects of potroom work on the prevalence of respiratory symptoms could be detected. The highest spirometric values in the potroom workers were found in ex-smokers. In contrast, the spirometric results were lower in ex-smokers than in never smokers and lowest in smokers of the control group. Therefore, it appears that the effect of workplace exposure was greatest in subjects who did not smoke, and the consequence of smoking was only found in non-exposed subjects. This indicates the lack of a combined effect of smoking and occupational exposure. Due to the cross-sectional design of this study, workers who left the job due to airway symptoms or disease and other factors related to respiratory function could not be captured. Therefore, it is important to recognize the impact of selection processes in cross-sectional studies of occupational exposures; ignoring these effects can lead to underestimation of the health effects of the hazard. For example, in this study, comparison of only the workers who were current smokers in both the exposed and control group revealed an inverse effect of potroom work on respiratory symptoms. The results likely reflect the increased probability for least susceptible subjects to continue to smoke and work in an atmosphere with respiratory irritants.</p><p id="P673">An Australian nested case-control study assessed employee risk factors for occupational asthma in primary aluminium smelting (<a class="bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/#R81" id="__tag_185976601" rid="R81">Barnard et al., 2004</a>). The study included 545 workers employed in areas with moderate to high levels of smelting dust and fume. Workers were included in the study if they had had their first employment medical examination between 1982 and 1995; the cohort was followed until December 31, 2000. Cases of potroom asthma were diagnosed by a set of standard criteria during regular medical surveillance of the cohort; some cases were self-referred. Subjects with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease due to welding or metal fume were excluded. Forty-five subjects were diagnosed with occupational asthma of aluminium smelting, or potroom asthma. Four controls per case were matched for the same year of employment-commencement and age within 5 years. The pre-employment medical questionnaires were examined and information regarding demographics, details of allergic symptoms, respiratory symptoms, and spirometric data were extracted. Follow-up data were collected to obtain information regarding hay fever and family history of asthma, full work history while at the smelter, and tobacco smoking history at termination, diagnosis or at cessation of the study. The investigators were blinded to the status (case or control) of the subject. Occupational hygiene monitoring was used to obtain the mean concentrations of respirable dust, fluorides, and sulphur dioxide in all areas. This allowed for the creation of five different exposure categories ranging from grade 4 (potrooms and potroom services) to grade 0 (areas of low air contamination). A cumulative exposure index for each individual was calculated based on the years worked in a specific area. The mean exposure index for cases was 21.21 and, for controls, was 17.84. Forty three of the 45 cases were working in potroom areas at the time of diagnosis. Subjects who were diagnosed with hay fever at the initial medical examination or during the follow-up period had an increased risk of developing potroom asthma (adjusted OR = 3.58, 95% CI: 1.57-8.21). Higher forced expiratory ratio at employment reduced the risk of developing potroom asthma (adjusted OR = 0.93, 95% CI: 0.88-0.99). These results suggest that individuals with hay fever may be more susceptible to developing asthma upon exposure to airborne irritants found in aluminium smelting potrooms. The authors proposed that this may have been a result of reduced nasal filtration and increased bronchial hyper-responsiveness in these individuals.</p><p id="P674">Welders working with aluminium (n=64), stainless steel (n=46) and railroad track workers (n=149) were studied by <a class="bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/#R1214" id="__tag_323627334" rid="R1214">Sjögren &amp; Ulfvarson (1985)</a> in relation to an age matched referent group of nonwelding industrial workers and railroad workers.

All three groups of welders reported higher frequencies of chronic bronchitis and other respiratory symptoms than their respective referents. Ozone appeared to be more highly correlated with the observed respiratory symptoms than aluminium particles among the aluminium welders.

(1993)</a> studied 25 welders exposed to aluminium. The exposed workers were matched for age and smoking habits to 25 males employed in a warehouse for wines. Subjects were interviewed by a physician to obtain information regarding symptoms of conjunctivitis, rhinitis, pharyngitis, and asthma. The subjects were asked if these symptoms were related to work (worsened during the work week). History of chronic bronchitis and bronchial hyperreactivity was also obtained. A physical examination was performed, including pulmonary auscultation. Allergic status was inferred from information obtained about the subjects= histories of atopic symptoms, and the administration of a skin prick test to common allergens. Air sampling analysis was conducted in the breathing zones of 19 welders and a urine sample was collected from each welder on Friday after the workshift and on the following Monday morning before work. Lung function tests were conducted to measure vital capacity, FEV<sub>1</sub>, and the maximum expiratory flow. The air sampling analysis indicated that the exposure to welding fumes was lower than PELs. However, the welders showed an increase in urinary aluminium, indicating a significant uptake. A higher prevalence of work-related eye and airways symptoms was noted in the welders than in the controls. There did not appear to be an association between allergic status and the development of symptoms. Welders who had been employed for less than 2.5 years experienced more symptoms than did long-term welders. This may reflect a selection for long term workers who are not susceptible to the work-related effects. Long-term welders exhibited a steeper slope of the alveolar plateau and a slight increase in volume of trapped gas as compared to the controls, following a methacholine inhalation test. These observations indicate that welding fumes may cause increased reactivity of the small airways. The welders in this study were exposed to both aluminium and stainless steel, so it is not known to which welding fume the effects were attributable, or if the effects were a result of a combination of these fumes, or other air contaminants in the plant. However, the authors stated that aluminium welding was far more frequent than stainless steel welding in this group of workers.</p></div><div class="sec sec-last" id="S185"><p></p><h5 class="inline" id="S185title">Occupational exposure to aluminium dust </h5><p class="p p-first" id="P676">Pulmonary function of workers exposed to different types of aluminium dust has not been extensively studied epidemiologically.

The patients received a standardized evaluation which included the completion of a health questionnaire, a neurological examination, and neuropsychological evaluation. An exposure index based on level and duration of exposure in the potroom was calculated for each worker. The most common symptoms reported by the patients were frequent loss of balance (88%) and memory loss (84%). Signs of incoordination in 84% were revealed by neurological examination, and neuropsychological tests showed a substantial impairment of memory function for 70-75% of the subjects. The degree of exposure in the potroom was graded for different job categories, level 1 represented the lowest exposure to dust and fumes from the potline, and level 4 represented the highest degree of exposure. The exposure index was significantly associated with signs and symptoms of incoordination. Workers were exposed to several contaminants in the potroom including; alumina, aluminium fibres, fluorides, calcium and cryolite. The neurotoxic properties of aluminium suggest that this particular potroom exposure may be responsible for the neurological symptoms described in these workers. It should be noted that this was not an epidemiological study, but rather a case report of a fairly large number of cases. There was no referent group which could have demonstrated the differences between the cases and controls.

The first control group was comprised of patients with dementias other than AD (n=164); the second control group consisted of individuals with no dementia (n= 176). Informants of both cases and controls were interviewed using a structured questionnaire. The subjects= occupational histories and other personal variables were obtained. Twenty-two of the 198 cases with AD had been exposed to aluminium at some point in their occupational history, compared to 39 of the 340 controls.

These results suggest that there is no association between previous occupational aluminium exposure and the risk of AD.

There have been numerous reports of diffuse pulmonary fibrosis and interstitial emphysema, but without nodule formation. Some cases were fatal, attributed to inhalation of metallic aluminium dust in workers in aluminium processing or manufacturing. Most of the exposures that resulted in the more severe outcomes occurred in Germany during World War II, in industrial environments that were heavily contaminated with airborne aluminium flake powder (used in explosives), and where there was unsatisfactory ventilation due to blackout. It is estimated that the highest air levels of aluminium occurred during production of pyro powders in the 1940s when concentrations reached 50 to 100 mg/m<sup>3</sup>.

These symptoms and a decreased FEV<sub>1</sub> were seen to a challenge with 10 mg aluminium powder and 10 mg/mL of aluminium chloride solution. The worker’s neutrophil chemotactic activity increased during the challenge. Skin tests to aluminium chloride produced no immediate reaction. The authors suggested that aluminium powder might have produced bronchoconstriction mediated by a non-immunological mechanism that could have involved neutrophils. A welder who had intermittently welded aluminium for 4 years developed symptoms of asthma 1 to 4 hr after ceasing welding (<a class="bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/#R1381" id="__tag_323627321" rid="R1381">Vandenplas et al., 1998</a>). Although skin tests with aluminium sulphate and nitrate did not show an immediate reactivity, the worker exhibited a large decrease in FEV<sub>1</sub> following aluminium welding. As positive skin tests to aluminium usually appear after 24 to 48 hr (see <em>Effects on Humans, Effects from Occupational Exposure, Irritation, Dermal Exposure</em>) the absence of immediate reactivity may not rule out hypersensitivity to aluminium. Asthmatic symptoms in this subject appeared after aluminium welding in the absence of detectable fluorides.

A comparison was made between the number of live births in the group of male workers (n=692) exposed to heat and magnetic fields from 11 aluminium producing factories with that in workers in the same factories who were not exposed to these factors (n=588); the workers were mainly employed as maintenance operators and had never worked in potrooms. In the passageways where potroom workers mainly stay, the maximum level of the magnetic fields to which exposures occurred was 20 mT<sup><a class="fn" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/#FN6" rid="FN6">2</a></sup>. The index taken for estimating the fertility of these workers was the number of live births since marriage, after the start of occupational exposure. They observed a significantly greater birthrate in the “<em>exposed</em>” group (3.11 ± 1.74) than in the “<em>control</em>” group (2.63 ± 1.34) 30 years after marriage, for instance. However, in this study, factors which could have influenced the results had not been taken into account, that is the contraceptive practices of couples and non-occupational factors influencing the fertility of the man and/or woman (e.g., smoking, which can alter male fertility, was more frequent in the “<em>exposed</em>” than in the “<em>non-exposed</em>” group; this could have been a bias). Comparison with a national reference (the average number of live births in the French population is 2.28) also reveals that the fertility of (“<em>exposed</em>” and “<em>control</em>”) subjects from these aluminium industries is greater than that of the population as a whole. However other factors can explain the disparities in fertility rates, especially the fertility of the socio-professional category of the subjects studied here (blue collar workers) which is higher than that of other socio-professional categories included in the national reference.

Metallic aluminium is produced commercially from its ores by the breakage of the aluminium-oxygen bonds (see <em>Sources of Human Exposure, Anthropogenic Sources, Production Levels and Processes</em>). This requires energy and if it recombines with oxygen in water or air this energy will in turn be released. Within the industrial environment, explosions continue to be reported as a result of the combination of molten aluminium and water when water turns to steam as it is trapped between the molten metal and a solid. Such a rapid expansion and rise in temperature has lead to a number of different types of steam-related explosions, producing a significant amount of damage. In the mid-1980’s the Aluminium Association initiated a reporting program for incidents of three different types of explosions. Defined as level of Force 1, 2, or 3 they cover steam explosions (less than 10 pounds of metal dispersed less than 15 feet), violent steam explosions (metal dispersed 15 to 50 feet); and catastrophic explosions resulting from reactions with air or water and the metal is dispersed more than 50 feet with little remains of the metal, respectively. A recent review outlines these types of industrial accidents and provides incident data by type of operation over the last 20 years (<a class="bibr popnode" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/#R365" rid="R365">Epstein, 2005</a>). As expected, the majority of the incidents are within the Force 1 level however, there has been relatively consistent number of Force 2 incidents over the years. While Force 1 incidents are associated with burn related injuries, Force 2 incidents represent the majority of fatalities and serious injuries.</p><p id="P733">When assessed, the explosibility of metallic dusts dispersed in air showed that minimum explosive concentrations of aluminium dusts ranged from 70 to 90 g/m<sup>3</sup> when ignited by a 1000 J system up to a maximum of 350 g/m<sup>3</sup> at 5000 J. The maximum adiabatic flame temperature is 3550 °K and the limit flame temperature is 2150 °K.

(1989)</a> conducted an ecological study of the incidence of AD in men and women aged 40-69 in 88 county districts from the records of 7 CT scanning units to which patients had been referred for diagnosis, in relation to levels of aluminium in drinking water over the previous 10 years. CT scans covered a 3-year period, either 1983-85 or 1984-86. There was a wide range of water aluminium concentrations. Rates were adjusted to compensate for different rates of referral according to the distance from the nearest CT scanning unit. Dementia was classified as probable AD (242 men, 203 women), possible AD (112 men, 109 women), cerebrovascular dementia (162 men, 111 women) and other dementia (154 men, 92 women). To examine differences in referral practices in different areas, a group of 2,936 epilepsy patients was also included. The risk of probable AD was 1.5 times higher in districts where the mean aluminium concentration exceeded 0.11 mg/L than in districts with concentrations of &lt;0.01 mg/L. There was no evidence of a dose-response relationship where there were intermediate levels of aluminium in water. There was no evidence of a relationship between other types of dementia or epilepsy and aluminium concentrations in water. It should be noted that this study included an unusually young population in relation to risk of AD (rates increase dramatically from ages 65-69 - the oldest people in this study – to those aged 85 and over). The authors justified exclusion of older age groups in which AD is more common on the basis that younger people presenting with clinical symptoms of dementia would more likely be more aggressively assessed and more likely to have a CT scan. The study was not population-based, i.e. not all people developing AD had an equal probability of being included in the analysis, only those under age 70 receiving a CT scan. It is not known how this sample differed from all AD cases in the area studied, but it was not representative.</p><p id="P738"><a class="bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/#R418" id="__tag_357487526" rid="R418">Flaten (1990)</a> examined geographical associations in Norway between aluminium in drinking water and death rates (underlying or contributing cause) from dementia including AD, as well as Parkinson=s disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Water samples were collected seasonally from October 1982 to August 1983 from 384 Norwegian waterworks supplying 70.9% of the Norwegian population, covering 193 municipalities. Death rates were standardized to the 1979 Norwegian population, for 3 5-year periods (1969-73, 1974-78, 1979-1983) and for the 10-year period, 1974-83. Municipalities were grouped into low, medium and high levels of aluminium (&lt;0.05 mg/L, 0.05-0.2 mg/L and &gt;0.2mg/L respectively), and correlation and regression analyses were conducted. Age-adjusted rates per 100,000 population (1974-1983) grouped by aluminium concentration in water showed relative risks (RR) for dementia in males of 1.00, 1.15 and 1.32 for low, medium and high levels of aluminium, respectively; for women, the corresponding values were 1.00, 1.19 and 1.42. This relationship did not hold true for mortality from Parkinson=s disease or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Flaten appropriately cautioned that these associations were ecological, serving to generate hypotheses for further study. The study has the strength of being population-based. The association could be stronger than reported if there was under-reporting of dementia on death certificates; however, since both underlying and contributing causes were used, this problem would be reduced. Typically, report of dementia on death certificates is specific but not as highly sensitive; that is, where dementia is recorded, it is highly likely that the decedent had dementia, but where it is not recorded, it will have been missed in some proportion of the death records.</p><p id="P739"><a class="bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/#R439" id="__tag_323627383" rid="R439">Frecker (1991)</a> examined the 1985-86 dementia mortality in Newfoundland to determine if there were unusual geographic distributions of disease.

Drinking water data included the level of aluminium in treated municipal water. They found an OR of 1.46 for aluminium concentrations of ≥ 0.200 mg/L compared to &lt;0.01 mg/L. While the analysis was conducted as a case-control study, the study was really ecological in that it did not have any data on potential confounders or effect modifiers.</p><p id="P741">In the Ontario Longitudinal Study of Aging (<a class="bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/#R431" id="__tag_185976548" rid="R431">Forbes et al., 1991</a>), 2,000 men were followed for about 30 years and, of the 782 who remained in the study in 1991, 400 demonstrated mental impairment at age 76. Aluminium and fluoride levels in drinking water were obtained from provincial sources and allocated by place of residence of the study participants. In their first publication, <a class="bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/#R431" id="__tag_185976801" rid="R431">Forbes et al.

They found that men living in areas with high fluoride were more likely to be cognitively normal; men in areas with high aluminium were less likely to be cognitively normal. The combination of high aluminium and low fluoride gave the lowest likelihood of being cognitively normal (OR=0.37); conversely, the OR for low aluminium and high fluoride was 1.5. No CIs or levels of statistical significance were given. Two further papers in 1992 and 1994 expanded on the first report (<a class="bibr popnode" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/#R428" rid="R428">Forbes &amp; Agwani, 1994a</a>; <a class="bibr popnode" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/#R432" rid="R432">Forbes et al., 1992</a>). The median concentration of aluminium in drinking water was 0.0847 mg/L, and, for fluoride, 0.88 mg/L in treated drinking water. Drinking water levels were classified as “<em>high</em>” if the concentration aluminium or fluoride was greater than, or equal to, the median value, and “<em>low</em>” if it was less than the median value. The OR was 2.72 (<em>p</em> &lt; 0.01) for subjects in areas with high concentrations of aluminium and low levels of fluoride in the drinking water, compared to those exposed to low aluminium and high fluoride concentrations. An analysis of the risk of impaired mental functioning according to pH, in addition to aluminium and fluoride, levels resulted in small numbers, which makes interpretation difficult (<a class="bibr popnode" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/#R433" rid="R433">Forbes et al., 1994</a>). There was a lower risk of impaired mental functioning with a neutral pH, between 7.85 and 8.05. Additional caveats include that the sample was not representative of the general population (a sample of males aged 45 in 1959), the possibility that those with mental impairment were more likely to drop out of the study, and the difficulty of accurately identifying impaired mental functioning based on a brief screening test and subjective impressions of the responses to the overall interview.</p><p id="P742"><a class="bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/#R1427" id="__tag_185976667" rid="R1427">Wettstein et al.

They measured memory skills using the Mini Mental Status test. Mnestic and naming skills did not differ between the high and low exposure groups. Urinary aluminium and serum aluminium levels were measured in 10 clinically diagnosed Alzheimer=s patients and 10 controls in both areas; no significant difference was found, adding strength to the negative findings. However, the highest concentration of aluminium in drinking water was below 100 μg/L.

A control group consisted of 15 siblings (all who were available) who had not lived in the Camelford area since before the water contamination incident. An additional control group of 42 similarly aged adults underwent the same psychological tests. Subjects completed the national adult reading test as a method of assessing IQ, and the Bexley Maudsley automated psychological screening to measure cognitive impairment. All affected participants complained of short term memory loss and impaired concentration. The mean pre-morbid IQ as assessed by the national adult reading test was above average. The IQ measure of the affected subjects was similar to their unaffected siblings. Affected subjects performed poorly on the symbol digit coding test as compared to the 42 unrelated controls. The symbol digit coding test is thought to be a measure of organic brain disease. The 15 unexposed siblings had significantly better symbol digit coding test results and flash-pattern differences than did their affected siblings. Many methodological issues must be considered in interpreting the results of this study. The cases were self selected and were pursuing litigation for cerebral damage claimed to be a result of the Camelford incident. It is possible that these cases may have already had unexplained symptoms and cognitive problems, and the incident served to highlight a potential cause (<a class="bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/#R268" id="__tag_185976421" rid="R268">David, 2000</a>).

(1994)</a> investigated the relationship between aluminium, fluorine, calcium, and pH in drinking water and the risk of cognitive impairment. This investigation used data collected from the population-based Paquid study. The study sample included 3,777 individuals 65 years of age and older. To assess their cognitive status, subjects completed the MMSE. Seventy-eight areas of distribution of drinking water were defined and aluminium, calcium, fluorine, and pH were measured in two separate surveys. A weighted mean of exposure was calculated for each water supply. Of the 3,697 subjects who competed the MMSE, 24.5% were defined as cognitively impaired. A mixed effects logistical regression was performed to estimate the association between the exposure variables and cognitive impairment while adjusting for age, sex, educational level, and occupation of the participants. Higher calcium levels in drinking water appeared to have a protective effect for cognitive impairment; the OR was 0.8 (<em>p</em> = 0.015, CI not provided) for a calcium concentration of 75 mg/L or greater compared to less than 75mg/L. The association between aluminium levels and cognitive impairment was not significant when pH was ignored. A weak interaction was detected between aluminium and pH levels. The association between aluminium and cognitive impairment was reported to be positive up to a pH of 7.0, and negative above that pH level. For example an OR of 1.35 was calculated for a concentration of aluminium of 100 ug/L compared to 5 ug/L at a pH of 7.0, while an OR of 0.5 was obtained at the same concentration level with a pH of 8.5. The CIs for these measures of association were not reported; thus the stability and significance of these results is not known.</p><p id="P745">In a subsequent analysis, the effect of silica in water on cognitive impairment was assessed in 3,450 participants in 71 parishes (<a class="bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/#R651" id="__tag_185976289" rid="R651">Jacqmin-Gadda et al., 1996</a>). A weighted mean of the measures obtained from two different surveys of each component of drinking water (pH, and concentrations of aluminium, calcium, and fluorine) was computed for each of the 71 areas. Three categories of silica levels were used (low, medium and high), defined by the first and last quartiles of the distribution. The prevalence of cognitive impairment for each of the categories was 24.0 (n=775), 21.8 (n=1,828), and 28.3% (n=847), respectively. In the regression model, in which first quartiles of exposure for the different water components were used as cut points, a significant relationship between silica, aluminium, and cognitive impairment was detected. In this model, when the level of silica and the pH were both low, subjects exposed to an aluminium concentration of 3.5 ug/L or more were more likely to have cognitive impairment compared to subjects in the lowest quartile of aluminium exposure (OR=3.94, 95% CI: 1.39-11.2). This CI is wide, indicating that the results were based on small numbers. ORs were calculated for eight different categories defined by the distributions of aluminium, pH, and silica. Low aluminium, high silica, and high pH was chosen as the reference category. An OR for cognitive impairment of 1.30 (95% CI: 0.75-2.24) was obtained for water districts with high aluminium, but low silica levels, and low pH. A lower OR (0.74, 95% CI: 0.53-1.02) was obtained for subjects living in areas with high aluminium levels, low pH, and high silica.

Informants of both cases and controls answered questionnaires designed to obtain information on general health, demographic factors, possible risk factors for AD, and family history of dementia. Historical data on aluminium levels in the drinking water were related to the place of residence at which the individual had lived the longest in the 10 years before the onset of symptoms of dementia. A total of 109 case-control pairs, for which there were available data on aluminium concentrations, were included in the analysis. The levels of aluminium in drinking water examined were &lt;50 ug/L, 50-99 ug/L, 100-149 ug/L and 150 ug/L and over.

Subjects were identified from the computerized tomographic records of eight neuroradiology centres in England and Wales. Male patients with a possible diagnosis of dementia or primary brain cancer were selected from the files. For each possible case of dementia the next male patient in the file who was born during the same 5-year period and had a diagnosis other than dementia (brain tumour, epilepsy, or chronic disabling disease) was also selected. One hundred and six men with AD were identified for inclusion in the study. Ninety-nine men with other dementing illnesses, 226 men with brain cancer, and 441 men with other diseases of the nervous system were included in the analysis as controls. Subjects or informants completed a questionnaire which was designed to obtain information regarding residential history. The response rate was 58% due to failure to obtain permission from the general practitioner to approach the patient or next of kin (303 subjects), difficulty in tracing the patient or next of kin (112 subjects), and refusal of the patient or next of kin (209 subjects). The average aluminium and silica concentration for each address and period of residence was calculated by obtaining data from the water plants supplying each area. Aluminium levels in the water supplies ranged from 0.004 to 0.481 mg/L, with a median level of 0.043 mg/L. Cases were compared to each of the control groups to examine the relationship between aluminium and silica levels and AD. The risk of AD did not appear to increase with increasing aluminium concentration. The average levels of silicon in the water ranged from 1.2 to 23.0 mg/L and were inversely related to the average aluminium concentrations. No significant association for AD risk was found for subjects living in areas where the concentration of silica was above 6 mg/L as compared to men exposed to silica concentrations below this threshold. In summary, this study did not find an association between the risk of AD and aluminium in drinking water (at an average concentration of up to about 0.2 mg/L), and the concentration of silica in drinking water did not appear to exert a protective effect.

Subjects diagnosed with AD were selected from one of two clinics. Selection of cases was limited to those who were married at the time of diagnosis since the spouse served as an informant. Friends of the case and/or informant were selected as controls; when this was not possible, a non-blood relative of the case was identified. The controls were within 10 years of age of the cases and did not suffer from memory loss. Case and control informants were interviewed about the subjects’ antiperspirant/deodorant use and antacid use. Subjects were defined as an antiperspirant/deodorant user if they were reported to have used these products at least once a month for one year prior to the reference year. Frequency, duration, and the name of the most common brands used were also obtained. A subject was considered to have been exposed to antacids if he or she had used antacids daily or almost daily for at least one year prior to the reference year. One hundred and thirty case-control pairs were included in this analysis. The age-adjusted OR for use of aluminium-containing antiperspirants vs. no use of antiperspirant was 1.7 (95% CI: 1.1-2.4). This component of the analysis included only 63 matched pairs as a result of missing information. There was a statistically significant dose-response relationship between the lifetime use of aluminium-containing antiperspirants and the risk of AD, adjusted for age (<em>p</em> = 0.01). The age-adjusted OR for antacid use vs. no use was 3.1 (95% CI: 1.3-7.5). A dose-response gradient was found for any antacid use (<em>p</em> = 0.009), and the adjusted OR for the highest level of exposure was 11.66 (95% CI: 1.28-106.4). However, no association was found when only aluminium-containing antacids were considered (OR=0.8, 95% CI: 0.3-2.1). There are some methodological issues which should be considered in interpreting the results of this study. The necessary use of surrogate informants may have resulted in misclassification of exposure data and a high frequency of missing information.

The discussion is organized by route of exposure for two reasons. First, information on dose-response and exposure is also organized by route of exposure. Second, the route of exposure can strongly influence a substance’s toxicity. This influence stems from differences in terms of the organs exposed and from differences in the degree of absorption (see <em>Toxicokinetics</em>). Where relevant, we also note the influence of chemical speciation on toxicity. However, the chemical species of aluminium <em>in vivo</em> is often unknown. Methods to separate <em>in vivo</em> aluminium species for identification and quantification are not generally employed, because there is great potential for changes in speciation during separation of metal complexes from each other due to perturbation of chemical equilibria during the process. An alternative approach is to use computational models that include the stability constants of metal-ligand complexes to calculate <em>in vivo</em> metal species concentrations. As there is not good agreement for the aluminium binding constants for many important ligands of aluminium, there is often not good agreement among the results of speciation modelling (<a class="bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/#R186" id="__tag_185976432" rid="R186">Caruso et al., 2005</a>).</p><p id="P846">Within each exposure route, we consider the following health endpoints: 1) acute toxicity, 2) irritation, 3) corrosivity, 4) sensitization, 5) repeated dose toxicity, 6) mutagenicity, 7) carcinogenicity, 8) reproductive toxicity, and 9) other forms of toxicity, as described by the <a class="bibr popnode" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/#R373" rid="R373">European Commission (2003)</a>. For each outcome and route of exposure, the weight of evidence for its potential to occur in humans, as evaluated based on a systematic narrative review (<a class="bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/#R1422" id="__tag_185976297" rid="R1422">Weed, 2005</a>) and consensus among the papers’ authors, is judged to be strong, modest, limited, or having no clear evidence. <em>Evaluation of Human Health Risks, Health Effects, Exposure Characterization</em> seeks to quantitatively evaluate the dose-response relationship information for outcomes having either strong or modest supporting evidence. For evidence of an effect to be strong, the preponderance of epidemiological data must be positive, with at least some coming from multiple studies with modest or large sample size and reasonably sound design. A study is judged to have a sound design if 1) its sample size is large enough to detect an effect of moderate magnitude; 2) it controls potential confounding effects sufficiently to ensure that their introduction of a spurious association is at most modest; and 3) it quantifies exposure to aluminium among subjects or groups of study subjects. Epidemiological evidence that is mixed or from studies of limited size or poor design can result in, at most, a modest finding of support for the existence of an effect. If there are only a small number of positive studies of decent design and size, evidence can be rated as limited. If there is minimal or no evidence of an effect, we rate support for it as having no clear evidence. Animal evidence on its own is insufficient to result in classification of an association as “strong.” Animal evidence can, however, serve to support epidemiological evidence. Strong animal evidence for an effect can also serve as the basis for classifying the weight of evidence for an effect as modest.</p><p id="P847">It is important to keep in mind that with the exception of the injection pathway, this section confines discussion to members of the population that are not believed to be especially susceptible to the effects of aluminium exposure. The section on individuals with impaired renal function (<em>Evaluation of Human Health Risks, Health Effects, Hazard Identification, Sensitive Subpopulations</em>) considers these individuals. Nor does this section in general place substantial weight on associations observed at extremely high levels of exposure (e.g., following chronic exposure to dialysis fluids containing aluminium), as such extreme exposures are not informative for the purpose of characterizing risks at exposure levels more typical of other pathways, which may be orders of magnitude smaller.</p><p class="p" id="P848">Finally, we note risks associated with aluminium’s physico-chemical properties.</p><div class="sec" id="S233"><p></p><h5 class="inline" id="S233title">Inhalation exposure </h5><p class="p p-first" id="P849">Studies investigating the impact of inhalation exposure to aluminium have considered the following endpoints listed in the introduction to <em>Evaluation of Human Health Risks, Health Effects, Hazard Identification</em>: (2) irritation; (6) mutagenicity; (7) carcinogenicity; (8) reproductive/developmental effects; and (9) other effects, including neurological toxicity.</p><div class="sec" id="S234"><p></p><h5 class="inline" id="S234title">Endpoint (2) – irritation </h5><p class="p p-first" id="P850">The association between respiratory symptoms and occupational exposure to aluminium among aluminium smelter workers has been investigated in a number of studies (see <em>Effects on Humans, Effects from Occupational Exposure, Respiratory Tract Effects</em>).

Neurological health effects are also possible, although for typical injections (e.g., for vaccination), only following daily injections over a period of many months.

population, the evidence suggests that exposure levels to airborne aluminium are well below plausible levels of concern.

Although these limits are not established for the general population, the 0.007 mg/m<sup>3</sup> concentration is also nearly four orders of magnitude below the concern level identified for aluminium powder in this assessment (see <a class="fig-table-link figpopup" co-legend-rid="" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2782734/table/T27/" rid-figpopup="T27" rid-ob="ob-T27" target="table"><span>Table 27</span></a>).

For reproductive toxicity, there is a margin of exposure of nearly 3000. On the other hand, for neurological effects (in particular, an increased risk for the development of AD), exposure to aluminium in drinking water (0.1 mg/L) may be similar to the level of concern we identified. This level of 0.1 mg/L is less than the recommended limits established by the WHO, the European Union, and Australia (see <a class="fig-table-link figpopup" co-legend-rid="" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2782734/table/T28/" rid-figpopup="T28" rid-ob="ob-T28" target="table"><span>Table 28</span></a>). Secondary drinking water regulations in the U.S. establish a limit of 0.05 to 0.2 mg/L for aluminium (<a class="fig-table-link figpopup" co-legend-rid="" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2782734/table/T28/" rid-figpopup="T28" rid-ob="ob-T28" target="table"><span>Table 28</span></a>).</p><p id="P914">The implication of the comparisons outlined here is that health effects associated with oral exposure to aluminium in general, and the neurological (AD) health endpoint in particular, deserve the greatest scrutiny. Limitations to the epidemiological evidence (confounding, uncertain exposure levels, and so forth) complicate its use for establishing toxicity benchmarks (such as a reference dose).</p><p id="P915">As pointed out by <a class="bibr popnode" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/#R948" rid="R948">Nieboer et al. (1995)</a>, the epidemiological evidence for a possible association between aluminium in drinking water and AD must be viewed in the context that this disease has a complex genetic trait. It is considered multifactorial, involving multiple genes that interact with multiple environmental (including life-style) factors. Early onset AD is strongly linked to mutations in 3 genes, with autosomal-dominant inheritance patterns (<a class="bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/#R119" id="__tag_185977133" rid="R119">Bertram &amp; Tanzi, 2004</a>; <a class="bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/#R120" id="__tag_185976429" rid="R120">2005</a>). By contrast, the more frequent late onset (at or older than age 65) AD, only one genetic risk factor has been consistently established and involves polymorphism of the ApoE gene; its epsilon-4 allele constitutes a risk factor (<a class="bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/#R119" id="__tag_185976993" rid="R119">Bertram &amp; Tanzi, 2004</a>; <a class="bibr popnode tag_hotlink tag_tooltip" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/#R120" id="__tag_185976307" rid="R120">2005</a>).

This evidence for a genetic contribution to the aetiology of AD does not preclude the possibility of an environmental contribution. However, positive findings in epidemiological studies completed to date need to be interpreted carefully in light of possible confounding and inherent study weaknesses.</p><p class="p p-last" id="P916">A chronic exposure animal bioassay might help to provide information on the neurological impact of oral exposure to aluminium. If such a study is conducted, it should expose animals via the relevant exposure route (oral exposure), rather than by other routes (e.g., injection). Before committing the time and resources to such a study, however, the limitations inherent to such a study need to be considered. First, while a laboratory animal study can identify alterations in the nervous system and neurobehavioural function, clinical relevance to neurological effects in humans, especially those related to a cognitive disease, are not clear. Second, such a study would likely necessitate use of high doses, making downward extrapolation to environmentally relevant doses and maintained neurobehavioural dysfunction necessary. While standard algorithms can be used to develop a point of departure (e.g., a benchmark dose) and identify appropriate adjustment factors (for calculation of a reference dose, for example), the implications of the resulting exposure value for human risk may not be clear. It should be noted that the exposure level of concern estimated here for aluminium in drinking water (100 μg/L) suggests that absorption of 6.9 × 10<sup>-6</sup> mg/kg-day aluminium is of concern. If that is the case, then exposures associated with food intake (uptake of 1 × 10<sup>-4</sup> mg/kg-day) or inhalation (1.7 × 10<sup>-5</sup> mg/kg-day) would also be of concern (see <a class="fig-table-link figpopup" co-legend-rid="" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2782734/table/T26/" rid-figpopup="T26" rid-ob="ob-T26" target="table"><span>Table 26</span></a>).

The experimental approach will probably include computational modelling. This work would also address whether the aluminium species significantly affects aluminium pharmacokinetics, such as oral bioavailability, and aluminium-induced effects, such as the association between aluminium consumption and cognitive loss.

For rodent studies, the general rule is that the metabolic rate of rodents is about 10 times that of humans. Therefore, in testing the efficacy or toxicity of a given compound, doses that are at least 10 times the normal human dose are usually used. However, in gauging the relative exposure of the rodent to aluminium, it would be preferable to document the steady-state level of aluminium in serum as a marker of exposure. This measure would provide information on absorption, which would be one variable to consider in assessing differences in metabolism between species. Internal biomarkers of exposure and target tissue body burdens are important for assessing neurotoxicity data on any chemical. Unfortunately, relatively few studies in the existing literature provide this important piece of information. As described in <em>Toxicokinetics</em>, the steady-state level of aluminium in serum of the average adult human is 1-2 μg/L. Most of this aluminium is bound to transferrin. Therefore, a study of rodents in which levels of aluminium in serum were maintained at 10-20 μg/L would be viewed as a reasonable approximation of normal human exposure. Studies that achieved higher steady-state levels (5 and 10 times normal serum levels or 50-100 μg/L to 100-200 μg/L) could be viewed as more rigorous tests of toxicity and would provide very useful information regarding the potential long-term effects of Al on various organ systems. From the data reviewed here, there is evidence that high levels of aluminium are toxic to the nervous system, can affect bone, and may affect hematopoiesis.

The regular ingestion of aluminium-containing antacids represents a major source of exposure to aluminium. However, very few studies have related their use to the development of AD.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency agreed to co-sponsor the risk assessment. An international scientific advisory committee was formed to provide independent oversight the risk assessment. The scientific advisory committee was comprised of: Jose L Domingo, Rovira i Virgili University, Spain, Anders Glynn, Swedish National Food Administration, Vesa Riihimaki, Finnish Institute of Occupational Health, and Thomas Wisniewski, New York University School of Medicine.</p><p id="__p103">The authors wish to acknowledge Ian Arnold, Eirik Nordheim, Chris Bayliss and Ed O’Hanian for providing helpful scientific background information on aluminium and Mari Golub and Wesley Harris for providing comments on the manuscript. The assistance of Nicole Boom and Nataliya Karyakina who served as research assistants, contributing to the development of background material on toxicological and epidemiological aspects is also gratefully acknowledged. Finally, Fan Mo helped to create a database of reference material, Nagarajkumar Yenugadhati provided editorial assistance, and Robert Clarke helped with organizational aspects of the work.</p><p id="__p104">D.
