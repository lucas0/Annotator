He was making a documentary, which he talked about a lot, about Dr. Sebi who is on our list. He also talked about our holistic doctor death series publicly. Months ago, I signed a contract with Entertainment One in Los Angeles to do a documentary series as well, on the doctors and it would feature Dr. Sebi. I vow that no matter what, this documentary will be made. </strong></p><p><strong>Our goal in providing this list is not to instill fear, but rather encourage people to speak up and be brave, in light of losing our heroes, who were all extraordinary people.</strong></p><p><strong>Our hearts go out to their family and friends.</strong></p><p></p><div class="fluid-width-video-wrapper" style="padding-top: 75%;"><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" id="fitvid0" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GOitEgpos4o?feature=oembed&amp;amp;wmode=opaque"></iframe></div><blockquote><p><a href="https://healthnutnews.com/join">Get our updates by clicking here</a></p></blockquote><p><strong>June 19, 2015, Father’s Day</strong></p><p>On Father’s Day, one year ago, the beloved Jeffrey Bradstreet was found dead in a river with a gunshot wound to his chest.</p><p>I was honored to do the first interview with the Boston eet family, and commend them for their bravery as they search for answers. They’ve hired private investigators and “want to get to the bottom of this”. <strong>Their investigators have concluded that Jeffrey Bradstreet didn’t commit suicide. He was murdered—without a doubt. </strong></p><p>Other families are coming forward and have hired their own investigators, <strong>including Dr. Marshall’s wife, who’s an MD. Her investigator believes that her husband was murdered in a “set up” staged by someone in law enforcement or with military training (story linked in the timeline below).</strong></p><p>More families are hiring investigators because they’re not buying the “official” accounts given by local law enforcement. A most prominent doctor has told me that their local law enforcement is considering the death and is <strong>talking with the FBI. </strong>That’s a start.</p><p>Since so many of these doctors (and the few researchers I included in this unintended series) were fathers, I wanted to honor them today, on Father’s Day. I finally agreed to be a producer on a film being made on the subject, but we still have a long way to go. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/HealthNutNews/videos/1273294962685688/">You can watch the trailer here. </a></p><p>The more we share this tragedy with others, the better chance we have of making progress. The fact that any law enforcement is even <em>talking</em> to the FBI is encouraging. I appreciate the few media organizations who’ve had the guts to share these stories: the New York Times, (who wrote me requesting info), The Independent UK, and network affiliates (ABC, CBS, NBC, FOX) around the US. Most mainstream sites barely cover one doctor’s death, let alone the dozens we’ve had die this year, if we include mysterious accidents, murders, alleged suicides or unexplained sudden deaths.</p><p><strong>As you’ll see in the timeline below, there are allegedly three dates within one month when two doctors died on the same day. That’s six doctors dying in pairs on three different days.</strong></p><p>Some skeptics who rolled their eyes at the first few deaths are now wondering if a connection exists. There have been theories, from GcMAF to CBD oil, but I don’t think all doctors used both treatments. I’m not convinced either is the smoking gun, but one or both might hold part of the answer.</p><p>Several unsolved murders and some alleged suicides are still under investigation. I sincerely hope answers are found. We knew several of these amazing doctors personally. We need to know the truth.</p><p>Besides the fact that the majority were holistic, they shared another common theme—they all cared deeply and were passionate about health. I have a trove of emails from their friends, patients, neighbors, loved ones and family. They were adored by many. I hope they’re never forgotten, and that others will carry on their work without living in fear.</p><p>These healers—some of whom were best-selling authors,  regulars in the media and put celebrities into remission from cancer and illnesses—were kind, caring people who’ve left this world a better place. I’m honored to have known them and am still studying their work today.</p><p><strong><a href="https://healthnutnews.com/join" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Sign up for the newsletter</a></strong> for more information and stay safe and strong.

The church at Dr. Gonzalez’ funeral in New York was packed with the patients he’d put in remission (some with stage IV pancreatic cancer) and who are still in remission decades later.
