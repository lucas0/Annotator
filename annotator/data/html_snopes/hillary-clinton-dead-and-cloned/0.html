Josh Billings remarked profoundly that "the trouble with people is not 
that they don't know but that they know so much as ain't so." There are 
those who know John Chrysostom said that "the image of God is not found 
in Woman." (Actually, he said that "the image of God is not found in Man 
or Woman.") There are those who know that Thomas Aquinas said that a 
woman is a defective male. (Actually, he explicitly denies this no fewer 
than five times.) There are those who know that Aristotle said that a 
woman is a deficient male-a description based on an appalling 
mistranslation.<p>

And there are those who know that an early council of bishops, held at 
Macon in Burgundy, France in a.d. 585 decreed that women do not have a 
soul. The bishops of course decreed no such thing, for if women do not 
have a soul how could they be baptized, how receive the Eucharist, how 
be venerated as martyrs in heaven? Yet it may be worthwhile to look at 
the story of this alleged decree, for one can see a myth in the 
making.</p><p>

The story begins, innocently enough, in the late sixteenth century. A 
young scholar, Valentius Acidalius, was working as a teacher in Silesia, 
and, like many young scholars, he was short of money. He thought to turn 
an honest penny by publishing a "diverting" pamphlet. In Latin the word 
<em>homo</em>, like the word <em>man</em> in English, primarily means "a 
human being, male or female, young or old," but has the secondary 
meaning of "adult male." Valentius thought it would be fun to use this 
ambiguity to "show" that in the Bible only adult males have souls. If he 
thought the pamphlet would amuse, he was grievously wrong. Simon 
Geddicus, a Lutheran scholar, launched a mighty counter-pamphlet 
entitled <em>A Defense of the Female Sex</em>, in which he proposed 
"manfully" (he actually uses the word <em>viriliter</em>) to "destroy 
each and every one of the arguments put forward by Valentius," who, the 
reader will learn with regret or satisfaction as the case may be, took a 
seizure and died.</p><p>

The pamphlet, however, often bound with the refutation by Simon 
Geddicus, survived, and it appears that it was published at Lyons in 
France in 1647. It was now in Italian, and was entitled <em>Women do not 
have a soul and do not belong to the human race, as is shown by many 
passages of Holy Scripture.</em> One gathers from a commentator that 
"the ladies of Italy took this system very differently. Some were vexed 
to have no souls. Others were pretty indifferent about the matter, and 
looking on themselves as mere machines, hoped to set their springs so 
well agoing as to make the men stark mad." Not all the ladies were 
silent, and the splendidly named Archangela Tarabotti wrote <em>A 
Defense of Women</em>. One way or another, the offending book caught the 
attention of Pope Innocent X, who put it on the Index of Prohibited 
Books (Decree of June 18, 1651). So much for the allegation that the 
Church holds that women do not have souls.</p><p>

But the suggestion that women do not have souls  was obviously in the 
air. It apparently came to the ears of Johannes Leyser, a Lutheran 
pastor from the region of Frankfurt in Germany, for he took up the idea 
and then sought confirmation for it in the doings of the Council of 
Macon, a small council of some forty-three bishops held in Burgundy in 
the year 585. Leyser had become a chaplain in the Danish army. The 
excitements, and no doubt opportunities, of military life seem to have 
sharpened his zest for feminine variety, for in 1676 he published a 
volume called <em>The Triumph of Polygamy</em>, in which he proclaimed 
the merits of a plurality of wives. Seeking support for his view that 
women are inferior, he decided to misquote the decrees of the Council of 
Macon. Leyser wrote: "Among the holy fathers [at the Council] there was 
one who insisted that women cannot, and should not, be called 'human 
beings' (<em>homines</em>). The matter was thought so important that it 
was discussed publicly and in the fear of God. Finally, after many 
arguments on this question, [the bishops] concluded that women are human 
after all."</p><p>

Now this is wholly untrue. The acts of the Council of Macon contain no 
such discussion. They contain neither the word "woman" nor the word 
"soul." What Leyser did was to misinterpret a story told in <em>The 
History of the Franks</em> by St. Gregory of Tours. Gregory was bishop 
of that city in the sixth century and wrote a splendid history of the 
region. At one point he tells of a council that may, or may not, have 
been the Council of Macon. Gregory writes:</p><p>

There came forward at this Council a certain bishop who maintained that 
woman could not be included under the term "man." However, he accepted 
the reasoning of the other bishops and did not press his case for the 
holy book of the Old Testament tells us that in the beginning, when God 
created man, "Male and female he created them and called their name 
Adam," which means earthly man; even so, he called the woman Eve, yet of 
both he used the word "man."</p><p>

So what the bishops discussed was the meaning of a word, not the 
substantial issue of whether women have souls.</p><p>

Leyser was inventing stories. His untruths were taken up by Pierre 
Bayle, a Dutch Calvinist with a marked distaste for the Catholicism to 
which he had once adhered. Bayle brought the matter further by writing 
in his <em>Dictionnaire</em>: "What I think yet more strange is to find 
that in a Council it has been gravely proposed as a question whether 
women were human creatures, and that it was determined affirmatively 
[only] after a long debate." Early in the nineteenth century a certain 
M. Aime-Martin wrote a touching book on <em>The Education of 
Mothers</em> in which he recorded sorrowfully that "people had gone so 
far as to doubt the existence of their souls." Politicians, as is their 
way, saw an opportunity, and the French National Assembly, no less, 
deplored the Church's insult to women. Later still the myth appeared in 
English in a journal titled <em>John Bull</em>, published by Horatio 
Bottomley, a fraudster Member of the British Parliament who would soon 
end in jail.</p><p>

The myth was by now securely established, and will no doubt be retailed 
as confidently in the future as it has been in the past. If the first 
casualty of war is the unwelcome truth, the first weapon of the 
discontented is the welcome lie.</p><p>
