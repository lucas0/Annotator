<p class="bodytext"><span class="bodytext"><span class="bodytext">Well, it's been a good ten years and 4.5 million or more happy customers* and it's finally time to give the current version of this site an upgrade. It's been a long time coming (partially done for quite a few years in fact) and now we have no other choice but to get on with it as the web server is at its very definite and final end of life.</span></span> We can't even ask for an extension!</p>
<p class="bodytext"><span class="bodytext"><span class="bodytext">Verily, it's a migration of the existing content to a shiny new web site. It will be phone and iPad friendly, it will be super fast, and ... did we mention shiny?</span></span></p>
<p class="bodytext"><span class="bodytext"><span class="bodytext">It's going to take a few weeks so there's going to be a bit of a gap. We'll be back.</span></span> The old site can <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170628144040/http://www.culthelp.info/" target="new">still be accessed at the Internet Archive</a>.</p>
