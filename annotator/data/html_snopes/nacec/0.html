<td><font face="arial" size="-1"></font><center><b>Regarding The DOD ACERT Alert SAR 03-0004 NACEC.org Website</b></center><p>
	    To help those that are here to do research on our organization's validity, 
	    credibility and sincerity, I am posting the following information.  I hope that 
	    this information will help to shine some light on both the memo's accuracy and 
	    our organization's credibility and legitimacy.</p><p>
<b>What is Flash Mail and why restart it?:</b><br/>
	    Flash Mail is a service for deployed military that allows them to send an electronic 
	    non-emergency letter back to family members that DO NOT HAVE access to e-mail service.  To use the service they 
	    simply fill in the Flash Mail letter form then press send.  Their letter is sent back to our 
	    system here in the U.S. where a volunteer prints the letter, puts it in an envelope, adds 
	    postage and puts it in the U.S. Postal Service for delivery.</p><p>
	    
	    This service makes it possible for their letter to reach the family member in just 
	    days instead of weeks.</p><p>
	    
	    The Flash Mail service was previously used in 1997, 1998, 1999.  Due to the expansion of 
	    the Internet and e-mail availability, it was discontinued in 1999.  At that time U.S. 
	    Force deployment were more or less at normal levels.</p><p>
	    
	    With the drastic increase in the number of U.S. Forces being deployed, we felt the Flash 
	    Mail service could again be of value to assist with routine military family communications.</p><p>
<b>The memo implies that the website registrant may not be a U.S. National, implying that I am not.</b><br/>
	    The website was registered by me NACEC's founder &amp; Executive Director.  I was born in Iowa and 
	    I am an Honorably Discharged Vietnam Era Veteran of the U.S. Army Signal Corp. (1970-72)!</p><p>

	    1990-91 NACEC grew out of the "<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20051025083227/http://www.nacec.org/dvp1.html">Desert Voices Project</a>" which provided a 2-way voice communications link from those serving in "Operation Desert Shield/Storm" to their families back home.  The Desert Voices Project communications center was designed, developed and managed by 
	    Edward &amp; Rebecca Addy NACEC's founders.  It was <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20051025083227/http://www.nacec.org/dvp/construction.html">built</a> on a old Nike Missile Base south of Minneapolis Minnesota leased from the U.S. Government and was one of the most powerful long-range HF 
	    2-way radio communications centers in North America.  It was operated as part of the DOD's 
	    Army MARS (Military Affiliate Radio System) and provided communications directly with 
	    front line military units in the desert using their units HF tactical radio equipment.  The project was so successful 
	    that it quickly gained national attentions and was even featured on the news program "Inside Edition".   Nearly 50 companies provided materials and equipment and over 200 volunteers came forward to serve 
	    as <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20051025083227/http://www.nacec.org/dvp/DVPVolunteers.html">radio operators</a> and the other staff needed to make it a success.  The Desert Voices Project handled over 5,000 radio/telephone calls and messages between U.S. Forces and their families back home.  
	    It was known and <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20051025083227/http://www.nacec.org/dvp/KSACards.html">appreciated</a> by U.S. Forces all over the deserts of the Middle East.
	    </p><p>
	    Desert Voices received recognition from many after the War and the project were over.<br/>

<b>Are you a bit confused after looking at just some of our history and information?</b><br/>  
	    Me too!  I feel like I have been stabbed in the back by the DOD when a simple phone call letting me know of their concerns would have sufficed.  When their actions 
	    in this tense environment cause fear and hate e-mail and comments from the military families that we 
	    have been serving faithfully for the past 12 years.</p><p>
</p><p>
<b>Here is some item by item information that is correct, unlike the misleading information 
in the memo;</b></p><p>

Item 1.<br/>  
The information collected is used only to provide the Flash Mail service, and for no 
other purpose.</p><p>

Item 2.<br/> 
Flash Mail is not for emergency message traffic and we do not promote it as such.  
That is the task of the Red Cross.  Until Feb 27th, we did use SSN's as a username 
as each user already knows their SSN so they did not need to remember another number 
or username.  As we are providing a letter mailing service we must acquire the FROM 
address, TO address and the TEXT of the letter that they want to send.  This information 
is used for no other purpose then to process and mail the letter.  It is not distributed 
in any way to or accessed by any other organization or entity.</p><p>

Item 3.<br/>
This item is actually a part of an e-mail that our volunteers were sending out to inform 
webmasters of Military Family web sites of the fact that Flash Mail was back on-line and 
operational.</p><p>

Item 4.<br/>  
NACEC is not a federal entity, it is a non-profit organization whose primary mission is 
to support large scale disaster relief operations and military family communications.  
NACEC was incorporated in 1993 and Federal Non-profit status was granted by the IRS in 
1994 as was its Minnesota charitable status.  All required disclosures to both federal 
and state governments are current.</p><p>

I am the Founder and Executive Director of the organization.  I was born in Iowa, and 
am an Honorably Discharged Vietnam Era Veteran of the U.S. Army Signal Corp (1970-72).</p><p>

Item 5.<br/>
After serving thousands of military families over the past 12 years, this memo is an 
insult to my integrity and that of our organizations and its hard working dedicated 
volunteers.</p><p>

Item 6. <br/> 
This is the memo originators opinion, without doing any real research into NACEC or 
its history.</p><p>
<b>What have we done to try to resolve this memo problem?</b><br/>



On February 26th I first heard about the memo in the morning from a TV reporter in Nevada.</p><p>
I called Chief Army MARS, who had not yet heard of the memo.  He asked me what we were 
doing and I told him.  It was quickly discovered that perhaps the problem was that we were 
using the SSN as the senders ID number.  I was told that the use of the SSN is not allowed because 
of risk of identity theft. </p><p>

As I could not find a number for ACERT I contacted RCERT a Regional CERT.  They knew 
nothing of the memo and could not find a copy of it in their system.  I walked them through 
the Flash Mail service and they felt that two things should be changed.  Stop using SSN's 
and make the communications with the system more secure.</p><p> 

That day the software was rewritten to use a unique computer generated PIN instead of the SSN and 
the revised software loaded into the system before midnight.  All files that had used 
SSN's were removed from the system at that time and the switch to PIN was complete.</p><p>

By noon on the 27th, the next day, we had secured Flash Mail by running all communications containing 
personal information between users computer and our main computer system through a secure 
server so it would be encrypted.</p><p>

We contacted Congressman James Oberstar's office who agreed to look into the memo and ACERT's actions.</p><p>

I received the first mostly complete copy of the memo with the contact information included.</p><p>

On February 28th I called the FBI in Duluth, but they did not want to talk to me as no case was open.</p><p>

We spent the next several days waiting to hear a reply from the Congressman's inquiry and 
answering hundreds of e-mails and comments from concerned and angry individuals that had 
seen the ACERT Alert memo.</p><p>

We then also met with the staff at U.S. Senator Mark Dayton's office and they also started 
looking into the memo.</p><p> 

We were contacted by and spoken with the FBI whose agent was satisfied 
that we are legitimate and not doing anything wrong.</p><p> 

On Monday March 10th I was contacted by the agent from the DOD's DCIS the Defense Criminal Investigators 
Service whose main concern seemed to be on security issues like what if someone hacked into our 
system and got the Flash Mail files.</p><p>

I then revised the software again making it possible for us to remove all 
addresses and the text of any letters, daily, yet still allow the system to provide feedback 
on the processing status of their letters to those that are using the Flash Mail service.  
This revision was installed by the next day.</p><p>

We then hired legal council as this thing was looking and feeling way to strange.  We 
were receiving death threats because of the ACERT memo so we call on local 
law enforcement who are now providing additional security.</p><p>

Our council talked to the DOD's DCIS the Defense Criminal Investigators Service and they 
had finished their investigation and had determined that we are indeed a legitimate 
organization and not doing anything wrong.</p><p>  

On March 12th I spoke directly with ACERT who stated they were already working with their 
legal department on a corrective Alert memo that they expected to transmit by March 14th.<br/>  
It seems that the original memo went out because they had just over reacted a bit!</p><p>

On March 14th, our legal council called ACERT to confirm that the corrective Alert memo 
stating that we are a legitimate organization would indeed be transmitted today.  He was 
told that it would indeed be sent out today.  This would start to get this damaging mess 
straightened out.</p><p>

Please send us a copy of this retraction and let us know what you have done to try to get 
this fresh information out to help let military families know the truth about our 
organization, as the original damning memo is still out there being circulated and needs 
to be stopped.</p><p>

Call your Senators and Congressmen letting them know what is going 
on here and that the DOD ACERT needs to be issued a specific set of operating guidelines 
to prevent them from making this type of incorrect misinformation attack on another legitimate 
organization in the future.
