<h2 align="center">Many Flee Homes to Escape `Gas Raid From Mars'--Phone
Calls Swamp Police at Broadcast of Wells Fantasy</h2>

<p>
A wave of mass hysteria seized thousands of radio listeners between 8:15
and 9:30 o'clock last night when a broadcast of a dramatization of H. G.
Wells's fantasy, "The War of the Worlds," led thousands to believe that
an interplanetary conflict had started with invading Martians spreading
wide death and destruction in New Jersey and New York.
</p><p>
The broadcast, which disrupted households, interrupted religious
services, created traffic jams and clogged communications systems, was
made by Orson Welles, who as the radio character, "The Shadow," used to
give "the creeps" to countless child listeners.  This time at least a
score of adults required medical treatment for shock and hysteria.
</p><p>
In Newark, in a single block at Heddon Terrace and Hawthorne Avenue,
more than twenty families rushed out of their houses with wet
handkerchiefs and towels over their faces to flee from what they
believed was to be a gas raid.  Some began moving household furniture.
</p><p>
Throughout New York families left their homes, some to flee to near-by
parks.  Thousands of persons called the police, newspapers and radio
stations here and in other cities of the United States and Canada
seeking advice on protective measures against the raids.
</p><p>
The program was produced by Mr. Welles and the Mercury Theatre on the
Air over station WABC and the Columbia Broadcasting System's
coast-to-coast network, from 8 to 9 o'clock.
</p><p>
The radio play, as presented, was to simulate a regular radio program
with a "break-in" for the material of the play.  The radio listeners,
apparently, missed or did not listen to the introduction, which was:
"The Columbia Broadcasting System and its affiliated stations present
Orson Welles and the Mercury Theatre on the Air in `The War of the
Worlds' by H. G. Wells."
</p><p>
They also failed to associate the program with the newspaper listening
of the program, announced as "Today:  8:00-9:00--Play:  H. G. Wells's
`War of the Worlds'--WABC."  They ignored three additional announcements
made during the broadcast emphasizing its fictional nature.
</p><p>
Mr. Welles opened the program with a description of the series of which
it is a part.  The simulated program began.  A weather report was given,
prosaically.  an announcer remoarked that the program would be continued
from a hotel, with dance music.  for a few moments a dance program was
given in the usual manner.  Then there was a "break-in" with a "flash"
about a professor at an observatory noting a series of gas explosions on
the planet Mars.
</p><p>
News bulletins and scene broadcasts followed, reporting, with the
technique in which the radio had reported actual events, the landing of
a "meteor" near Princeton N. J., "killing" 1,500 persons, the discovery
that the "meteor" was a "metal cylinder" containing strange creatures
from Mars armed with "death rays" to open hostilities against the
inhabitants of the earth.
</p><p>
Despite the fantastic nature of the reported "occurrences," the program,
coming after the recent war scare in Europe and a period in which the
radio frequently had interrupted regularly scheduled programs to report
developments in the Czechosolvak situation, caused fright and panic
throughout the area of the broadcast.
</p><p>
Telephone lines were tied up with calls from listeners or persons who
had heard of the broadcasts.  Many sought first to verify the reports.
But large numbers, obviously in a state of terror, asked how they could
follow the broadcast's advice and flee from the city, whether they would
be safer in the "gas raid" in the cellar or on the roof, how they could
safeguard their children, and many of the questions which had been
worrying residents of London and Paris during the tense days before the
Munich agreement.
</p><p>
So many calls came to newspapers and so many newspapers found it
advisable to check on the reports despite their fantastic content that
The Associated Press sent out the following at 8:48 P. M.:
</p><p>
"Note to Editors:  Queries to newspapers from radio listeners throughout
the United States tonight, regarding a reported meteor fall which killed
a number of New Jerseyites, are the result of a studio dramatization.
The A. P."
</p><p>
Similarly police teletype systems carried notices to all stationhouses,
and police short-wave radio stations notified police radio cars that the
event was imaginary.
</p><h5 align="center">
Message From the Police
</h5><p>
The New York police sent out the following:
</p><p>
"To all receivers:  Station WABC informs us that the broadcast just
concluded over that station was a dramatization of a play.  No cause for
alarm."
</p><p>
The New Jersey State Police teletyped the following:
</p><p>
"Note to all receivers--WABC broadcast as drama re this section being
attacked by residents of Mars.  Imaginary affair."
</p><p>
From one New York theatre a manager reported that a throng of playgoers
had rushed from his theatre as a result of the broadcast.  He said that
the wives of two men in the audience, having heard the broadcast, called
the theatre and insisted that their husbands be paged.  This spread the
"news" to others in the audience.
</p><p>
The switchboard of <em>The New York Times</em> was overwhelmed by the
calls.  A total of 875 were received.  One man who called from Dayton,
Ohio, asked, "What time will it be the end of the world?"  A caller from
the suburbs said he had had a houseful of guests and all had rushed out
to the yard for safety.
</p><p>
Warren Dean, a member of the American Legion living in Manhattan, who
telephoned to verify the "reports," expressed indignation which was
typical of that of many callers.
</p><p>
"I've heard a lot of radio programs, but I've never heard anything as
rotten as that," Mr. Dean said.  "It was too realistic for comfort.
They broke into a dance program with a news flash.  Everybody in my
house was agitated by the news.  It went on just like press radio news."
</p><p>
At 9 o'clock a woman walked into the West Forty-seventh Street police
station dragging two children, all carrying extra clothing.  She said
she was ready to leave the city.  Police persuaded her to stay.
</p><p>
A garbled version of the reports reached the Dixie Bus terminal, causing
officials there to prepare to change their schedule on confirmation of
"news" of an accident at Princeton on their New Jersey route.  Miss
Dorothy Brown at the terminal sought verification, however, when the
caller refused to talk with the dispatcher, explaining to here that "the
world is coming to an end and I have a lot to do."
</p><h5 align="center">
Harlem Shaken By the "News"
</h5><p>
Harlem was shaken by the "news."  Thirty men and women rushed into the
West 123d Street police station and twelve into the West 135th Street
station saying they had their household goods packed and were all ready
to leave Harlem if the police would tell them where to go to be
"evacuated."  One man insisted he had heard "the President's voice" over
the radio advising all citizens to leave the cities.
</p><p>
The parlor churches in the Negro district, congregations of the smaller
sects meeting on the ground floors of brownstone houses, took the "news"
in stride as less faithful parishioners rushed in with it, seeking
spiritual consolation.  Evening services became "end of the world"
prayer meetings in some.
</p><p>
One man ran into the Wadsworth Avenue Police Station in Washington
Heights, white with terror, crossing the Hudson River and asking what he
should do.  A man came in to the West 152d Street Station, seeking
traffic directions.  The broadcast became a rumor that spread through
the district and many persons stood on street corners hoping for a sight
of the "battle" in the skies.
</p><p>
In Queens the principal question asked of the switchboard operators at
Police Headquarters was whether "the wave of poison gas will reach as
far as Queens."  Many said they were all packed up and ready to leave
Queens when told to do so.
</p><p>
Samuel Tishman of 100 Riverside Drive was one of the multitude that fled
into the street after hearing part of the program.  He declared that
hundreds of persons evacuated their homes fearing that the "city was
being bombed."
</p><p>
"I came home at 9:15 P.M. just in time to receive a telephone call from
my nephew who was frantic with fear.  He told me the city was about to
be bombed from the air and advised me to get out of the building at
once.  I turned on the radio and heard the bradcast which coroborated
what my nephew had said, grabbed my hat and coat and a few personal
belongings and ran to the elevator.  When I got to the street there were
hundreds of people milling around in panic.  Most of us ran toward
Broadway and it was not until we stopped taxi drivers who had heard the
entire broadcast on their radios that we knew what it was all about.  It
was the most asinine stunt I ever heard of."
</p><p>
"I heard that broadcast and almost had a heart attack," said Louis
Winkler of 1,322 Clay Avenue, the Bronx.  "I didn't tune it in until the
program was half over, but when I heard the names and titles of Federal,
State and municipal officials and when the `Secretary of the Interior'
was introduced, I was convinced it was the McCoy.  I ran out into the
street with scores of others, and found people running in all
directions.  The whole thing came over as a news broadcast and in my
mind it was a pretty crummy thing to do."
</p><p>
The Telegraph Bureau switchboard at police headquarters in Manhattan,
operated by thirteen men, was so swamped with calls from apprehensive
citizens inquiring about the broadcast that police business was
seriously interfered with.
</p><p>
Headquarters, unable to reach the radio station by telephone, sent a
radio patrol car there to ascertain the reason for the reaction to the
program.  When the explanation was given, a police message was sent to
all precincts in the five boroughs advising the commands of the cause.
</p><h5 align="center">
"They're Bombing New Jersey!"
</h5><p>
Patrolman John Morrison was on duty at the switchboard in the Bronx
Police Headquarters when, as he afterward expressed it, all the lines
became busy at once.  Among the first who answered was a man who
informed him:
</p><p>
"They're bombing New Jersey!"
</p><p>
"How do you know?" Patrolman Morrison inquired.
</p><p>
"I heard it on the radio," the voice at the other end of the wire
replied.  "Then I went to the roof and I could see the smoke from the
bombs, drifting over toward New York.  What shall I do?"
</p><p>
The patrolman calmed the caller as well as he could, then asnwered other
inquiries from persons who wanted to know whether the reports of a
bombardment were true, and if so where they should take refuge.
</p><p>
At Brooklyn police headquarters, eight men assigned to the monitor
switchboard estimated that they had answered more than 800 inquiries
from persons who had been alarmed by the broadcast.  A number of these,
the police said, came from motorists who had heard the program over
their car radios and were alarmed both for themselves and for persons at
their homes.  Also, the Brooklyn police reported, a preponderance of the
calls seemed to come from women.
</p><p>
The National Broadcasting Company reported that men stationed at the WJZ
transmitting station at Bound Brook, N. J., had received dozens of calls
from residents of that area.  The transmitting station communicated with
New York an passed the information that there was no cuase for alarm to
the persons who inquired later.
</p><p>
Meanwhile the New York telephone operators of the company found their
switchboards swamped with incoming demands for information, although the
NBC system had no part in the program.
</p><h5 align="center">
Record Westchester Calls
</h5><p>
The State, county, parkway and local police in Westchester Counter were
swamped also with calls from terrified residents.  Of the local police
departments, Mount Vernon, White Plains, Mount Kisco, Yonkers and
Tarrytown received most of the inquiries.  At first the authorities
thought they were being made the victims of a practical joke, but hwen
the calls persisted an dincreased in volume they began to make
inquiries.  The New York Telephone Company reported that it had never
handled so many calls in one hour in years in Westchester.
</p><p>
One man called the Mount Vernon Police Headquarters to find out "where
the forty policement were killed"; another said he brother was ill in
bed listening to the broadcast and when he heard the reports he got into
an automobile and "disappeared."  "I'm nearly crazy!" the caller
exclaimed.
</p><p>
Because some of the inmates took the catastrophic reports seriously as
they came over the radio, some of the hospitals and the county
penitentiary ordered that the radios be turned off.
</p><p>
Thousands of calls came in to Newark Police Headquarters.  These were
not only from the terrorstricken.  Hundreds of physicians and nurses,
believing the reports to be true, called to volunteer their services to
aid the "injured."  City ofifcials also claled in to make "emergency"
arrangements for the population.  Radio cars were stopped by the
panicky throughout that city.
</p><p>
Jersey City police headquarters received similiar clals.  One woman
asked detective Timothy Grooty, on duty there, "Shall I close my
windows?"  A man asked, "Have the police any extra gas masks?"  Many of
the callers, on being assured the reports were fiction, queried again
and again, uncertain in whom to believe.
</p><p>
Scores of persons in lower Newark Avenue, Jersey City, left their homes
and stood fearfully in the street, looking with apprehension toward the
sky.  A radio car was dispatched there to reassure them.
</p><p>
The incident at Hedden Terrace and Hawthorne Avenue, in Newark, one of
the most dramatic in the area, caused a tie-up in traffic for blocks
around.  the more than twenty families there apparently believed the
"gas attack" had started, and so reported to the police.  An ambulance,
three radio cars and a police emergency squad of eight men were sent to
the scene with full inhalator apparatus.
</p><p>
They found the families with wet cloths on faces contorted with
hysteria.  The police calmed them, halted the those who were attempting
to move thier furniture on their cars and after a time were able to
clear the traffic snarl.
</p><p>
At St. Michael's Hospital, High Street and Central Avenue, in the heart
of the Newark industrial district, fifteen men and women were treated
for shock and hysteria.  In some cases it was necessary to give
sedatives, and nurses and physicians sat down and talked with the more
seriously affected.
</p><p>
While this was going on, three persons with children under treatment in
the institution telephoned that they were taking them out and leaving
the city, but their fears were calmed when hospital authorities
explained what had happened.
</p><p>
A flickering of electric lights in Bergen County from about 6:15 to 6:30
last evening provided a build-up for the terror that was to ensue when
the radio broadcast started.
</p><p>
Without going out entirely, the lights dimmed and brightened alternately
and radio reception was also affected.  The Public Service Gas and
Electric Company was mystified by the behavior of the lights, declaring
there was nothing wrong at their power plants or in their distributing
system.  A spokesman for the service department said a call was made to
Newark and the same situation was reported.  He believed, he said, that
the condition was general throughout the State.
</p><p>
The New Jersey Bell Telephone Company reported that every central office
in the State was flooded with calls for more than an hour and the
company did not have time to summon emergency operators to relieve the
congestion.  Hardest hit was the Trenton toll office, which handled
calls from all over the East.
</p><p>
One of the radio reports, the statement about the mobilization of 7,000
national guardsmen in New Jersey, caused the armories of the Sussex and
Essex troops to be swamped with calls from officers and men seeking
information about the mobilization place.
</p><h5 align="center">
Prayers for Deliverance
</h5><p>
In Caldwell, N. J., an excited parishoner ran into the First Baptist
Church during evening services and shouted that a meteor had fallen,
showering death and destruction, and that North Jersey was threatened.
The Rev. Thomas Thomas, the pastor quieted the congregation and all
prayed for deliverance from the "catastrophe."
</p><p>
East Orange police headquarters received more than 200 calls from
persons who wanted to know what to do to escape the "gas."  Unaware of
the broadcast, the switchboard operator tried to telephone Newark, but
was unable to get the call through because the switchboard at Newark
headquarters was tied up.  The mystery was not cleared up until a
teletype explanation had been received from Trenton.
</p><p>
More than 100 calls were received at Maplewood police headquarters and
during the excitement two families of motorists, residents of New York
City, arrived at the station to inquire how they were to get back to
their homes now that the Pulaski Skyway had been blown up.
</p><p>
The women and children were crying and it took some time for the police
to convince them that the catastrophe was fictitious.  Many persons who
called Maplewood said their neighbors were packing their possessions and
preparing to leave for the country.
</p><p>
In Orange, N. J., an unidentified man rushed into the lobby of the Lido
Theatre, a neighborhood motion picture house, with the intention of
"warning" the audience that a meteor had fallen on Raymond Boulevard,
Newark, and was spreading poisonous gases.  Skeptical, Al Hochberg,
manager of the theatre, prevented the man from entering the auditorium
of the theatre and then called the police.  He was informed that the
radio broadcast was responsible for the man's alarm.
</p><p>
Emanuel Priola, bartender of a tavern at 442 Valley Road, West Orange,
closed the place, sending away six customers, in the middle of the
broadcast to "rescue" his wife and two children.
</p><p>
"At first I thought it was a lot of Buck Rogers stuff, but when a friend
telephoned me that general orders had been issued to evacuate every one
from the metropolitan area I put the customers out, closed the place and
started to drive home," he said.
</p><p>
William H. Decker of 20 Aubrey Road, Montclair, N. J., denounced the
broadcast as "a disgrance" and "an outrage," which he said had
frightened hundreds of residents in his community, including children.
He said he knew of one woman who ran into the street with her two
children and asked for the help of neighbors in saving them.
</p><p>
"We were sitting in the living room casually listening to the radio," he
said, "when we heard reports of a meteor falling near New Brunswick and
reports that gas was spreading.  Then there was an announcement of the
Secretary of Interior from Washington who spoke of the happening as a
major disaster.  It was the worst thing I ever heard over the air."
</p><h5 align="center">
Columbia Explains Broadcast
</h5><p>
The Columbia Broadcasting System issued a statement saying that the
adaption of Mr. Wells's novel which was broadcast "followed the original
closely, but ot make the imaginary details more interesting to American
listeners the adapter, Orson Welles, substituted an American locale for
the English scenes of the story."
</p><p>
Pointing out that the fictional character of the broadcast had been
announced four times and had been previously publicized, it continued:
</p><p>
"Nevertheless, the program apparently was produced with such vividness
that some listeners who may have heard only fragments thought the
broadcast was fact, not fiction.  Hundreds of telephone calls reaching
CBS stations, city authorities, newspaper offices and police
headquarters in various cities testified to the mistaken belief.
</p><p>
"Naturally, it was neither Columbia's nor the Mercury Theatre's
intention to mislead any one, and when it became evident that a part of
the audience had been disturbed by th performance five announcements
were read over the network later in the evening to reassure those
listeners."
</p><p>
Expressing profound regret that his dramatic efforts should cause such
consternation, Mr. Welles said:  "I don't think we will choose anything
like this again."  He hesitated about presenting it, he disclosed,
because "it was our thought that perhaps people might be bored or
annoyed at hearing a tale so improbable."

<h4 align="center">SCARE IS NATIONWIDE</h4>
<h5 align="center">Broadcast Spreads Fear In New England, the South and
West</h5>
<hr width="22%"/>
<p>
Last night's radio "war scare" shocked thousands of men, women and
children in the big cities throughout the country.  Newspaper offices,
police stations and radio stations were besieged with calls from anxious
relatives of New Jersey residents, and in some places anxious groups
discussed the impending menace of a disastrous war.
</p><p>
Most of the listeners who sought more information were widely confused
over the reports they had heard, and many were indignant when they
learned that fiction was the cause of their alarm.
</p><p>
In San Francisco the general impression of listeners seemed to be that
an overwhelming force had invaded the United States from the air, was in
the process of destroying New York and threatening to move westward.
"My God," roared one inquirer into a telephone, "where can I volunteer
my services?  We've got to stop this awful thing."
</p><p>
Newspaper offices and radio stations in Chicago were swamped with
telephone calls about the "meteor" that had fallen in New Jersey.  Some
said they had relatives in the "stricken area" and asked if the casualty
list was available.
</p><p>
In parts of St. Louis men and women clustered in the streets in
residential areas to discuss what they should do in the face of the
sudden war.  One suburban resident drove fifteen miles to a newspaper
office to verify the radio "report."
</p><p>
In New Orleans a general impression prevailed that New Jersey had been
devastated by the "invaders," but fewer inquiries were received than in
other cities.
</p><p>
In Baltimore a woman engaged passage on an airliner for New York, where
her daughter is in school.
</p><p>
The Associated Press gathered the following reports of reaction to the
broadcast:
</p><p>
At Fayetteville, N. C., people with relatives in the section of New
Jersey where the mythical visitation had its locale went to a newspaper
office in tears, seeking information.
</p><p>
A message from Providence, R. I., said:  "Weeping and hysterical women
swamped the switchboard of The Providence Journal for details of the
massacre and destruction at New York, and officials of the electric
company received scores of calls urging them to turn off all lights so
that the city would be safe from the enemy."
</p><p>
Mass hysteria mounted so high in some cases that people told the police
and newspapers they "saw" the invasion.
</p><p>
The Boston Globe told of one woman who claimed she could "see the fire,"
and said she and many others in her neighborhood were "getting out of
here."
</p><p>
Minneapolis and St. Paul police switchboards were deluged with calls
from frightened people.
</p><p>
The Times-Dispatch in Richmond, Va., reported some of their telephone
calls from people people who said they were "praying."
</p><p>
The Kansas City bureau of The Associated Press received inquiries on the
"meteors" from Los Angeles, Salt Lake City, Beaumont, Texas, and St.
Joseph, Mo., in addition to having its local switchboards flooded with
calls.  One telephone informant said he had loaded all his children into
his car, had filled it with gasoline, and was going somewhere.  "Where
is it safe?" he wanted to know.
</p><p>
Atlanta reported that listeners throughout the Southeast "had it that a
planet struck in New Jersey, with monsters and almost everything and
anywhere from 40 to 7,000 people reported killed."  Editors said
responsible persons, known to them, were among the anxious information
seekers.
</p><p>
In Birmingham, Ala., people gathered in groups and prayed, and Memphis
had its full quota of weeping women calling in to learn the facts.
</p><p>
In Indianapolis a woman ran into a church screaming:  "New York
destroyed; it's the end of the world.  You might as well go home to die.
I just heard it on the radio."  Services were dismissed immediately.
</p><p>
Five students at Brevard College, N. C., fainted and panic gripped the
campus for a half hour with many students fighting for telephones to ask
their parents to come and get them.
</p><p>
A man in Pittsburgh said he returned home in the midst of the broadcast
and found his wife in the bathroom, a bottle of poison in her hand, and
screaming:  "I'd rather die this way than like that."
</p><p>
He calmed her, listened to the broadcast and then rushed to a telephone
to get an explanation.
</p><p>
Officials of station CFRB, Toronto, said they never had had so many
inquiries regarding a single broadcast, the Canadian Press reported.

WASHINGTON, Oct. 30.--Informed of the furore created tonight by the
broadcasting of Wells drama, "War of the Worlds," officials of the
Federal Communications Commission indicated that the commission might
review the broadcast.
</p><p>
The usual practice of the commission is not to investigate broadcasts

</p><p>
Dr. Arthur F. Buddington, chairman of the Department of Geology, and Dr.
Harry Hess, Professor of Geology, received the first alarming reports in
a form indicating that a meteor had fallen near Dutch Neck, some five
miles away.  They armed themselves with the necessary equipment and set
out to find a specimen.  All they found was a group of sightseers,
searching like themselves for the meteor.
</p><p>
At least a dozen students received telephone calls from their parents,
alarmed by the broadcast.  The Daily Princetonian, campus newspaper,
received numerous calls from students and alumni.
