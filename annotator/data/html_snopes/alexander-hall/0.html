  Alexander Hall holds an undeserved place of scorn in the mythology of
Princeton undergraduates.  Legend has it that Alexander Hall was designed by a
student as his architectural thesis -- and that he received a failing grade for
his effort.</p><p>
Later, the story goes, this same alumnus got his revenge by agreeing to donate
a large sum to the University, but only if the gift were used to construct his
failed senior thesis project.  A great story, but completely apocryphal.</p><p>
</p><p>
	The only grades associated with Alexander Hall were those of the thousands of
students whose marks were posted in Alexander at the end of each term --
perhaps the root of undergraduate enmity for the building.  Far from being
designed by an undergraduate, Alexander Hall represents the culmination of
architect William A. Potter's work at Princeton.  </p><p>
</p><p>
	Almost the house architect for Princeton during the McCosh years, Potter
designed such Princeton landmarks as Chancellor Green Library, the John C.
Green School of Science, and, with his partner, Robert H. Robertson,  Witherspoon Hall,
and the University Hotel.  When the Trustees determined, in 1890, that Princeton needed
a "convocation" hall that could seat the entire student body, Potter was the logical
choice to design it.</p><p>
</p><p>
	A donor was found in Harriet Crocker Alexander, the wife of Charles B.
Alexander, class of 1870.  The Alexanders and Princeton had deep ties:
Archibald Alexander was the first professor of theology at the Princeton
Theological Seminary; James Alexander taught at both the College and the
Seminary; and Henry Alexander, class of 1840, was a Trustee of the College. </p><p>
</p><p>
	Potter's design for Alexander Hall drew on several sources.  The
horseshoe-shaped floorplan, with its arcaded ambulatory, <a href="http://etcweb.princeton.edu/Campus/text_Alexander.html/campusimages/33-51.jpeg">

  was modeled
after the Palais de Trocadero, designed for the Paris Exhibition of 1878.  The
style of the building, however, was quite plainly Richardsonian Romanesque,
especially in the contrasting rough-faced red granite walls and brown sandstone
trim.  Other classical Richardsonian features in Alexander include its steep
gabled roof, with tall dormers and the zig-zag detail under the eaves. <a href="http://etcweb.princeton.edu/Campus/text_Alexander.html/campusimages/54-1.jpeg">

     Alexander was well-conceived to serve its purpose as a large meeting hall.
The two towers on the north side of the structure served as stairway towers to
the balcony seats.  (These towers, as well as the taller southern towers,
echoed the towers in the nearby Bonner-Marquand Gymnasium and Witherspoon
Hall.) The ambulatory, which, in 1928, was glassed in, featured seven entrances
into the hall itself and ensured good circulation. </p><p>
</p><p>
	The interior <a href="http://etcweb.princeton.edu/Campus/text_Alexander.html/campusimages/53-4.jpeg">

 was dominated by rostrum measuring 53 feet by 35 feet,
with a large throne-like marble chair -- "the President's seat" -- placed in
the exact center.  Seats for the faculty rose in a semi-circle behind this
chair, while panels painted with scenes from Homer rose two stories behind
these seats. <a href="http://etcweb.princeton.edu/Campus/text_Alexander.html/campusimages/33-50.jpeg">

  A large rose window, by Tiffany, completed the design.</p><p>
</p><p>
	Alexander Hall's most striking exterior facade, however, is its ornately
carved southern side, facing Witherspoon Hall. <a href="http://etcweb.princeton.edu/Campus/text_Alexander.html/campusimages/53-3.jpeg">

  Centered underneath the
rose window is a bas-relief sculpture of 36 figures.  Designed by J.A. Bolger
and executed by J. Massey Rhind, these figures revolve around the seated figure
that represents Learning.  The figures to his left represent  
the fields of Oratory, Theology, Law, History, Philosophy, and Ethics; to his
right, Architecture, Sculpture, Painting, Poetry, Music, and Belles-Lettres.
The figure in the large panel to the left, above Learning, represents Law, that
to the upper right, Religion.  <a href="http://etcweb.princeton.edu/Campus/text_Alexander.html/campusimages/53-6.jpeg">
<img align="LEFT" alt="[53-6]" src="http://etcweb.princeton.edu/campusgiffiles/53-6.gif"/></a>
<br clear="LEFT"/>
  The carving of these sculptures
continued long after the building was dedicated on June 9, 1894.</p><p>
</p><p>
	In the context of the modern Princeton campus, the location of Alexander Hall
-- to the west of Nassau Hall and behind the Presbyterian Church -- seems a bit
odd.  But at the time, Potter urged the Trustees to demolish the old Greek
Revival church, which would have created a large open area running along the
entire northern side of the campus.</p><p>
</p><p>
	In that event, Nassau Hall would have been framed by two Potter buildings:
Chancellor Green to the east, and Alexander Hall to the west - featuring tall
dormers and strong geometric patterns. <br clear="RIGHT"/>

 This plan would have 
fulfilled McCosh's vision for a Princeton campus set in a park-like environment 
and separated from Nassau Street by a long, wide green.</p><p>
</p><p>
	Alexander Hall was the last High Victorian Gothic building constructed at
Princeton.  In recent years, Alexander Hall has made something of a comeback in
terms of use and popularity.  It was extensively renovated in 1985 (it is now
known as David B. Richardson '33 Auditorium in Alexander Hall), and its fine
qualities as a lecture and recital space are increasingly appreciated - even by
undergraduates.
