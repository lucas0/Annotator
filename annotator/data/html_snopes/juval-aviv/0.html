<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><img height="40" src="http://americanradioworks.publicradio.org/features/lockerbie/resources/../story/nav_images/title_aviv.gif" width="289"/><br/>
</b></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Juval Aviv is a 
dual US-Israeli citizen. He says he was an agent for Mossad, the Israeli intelligence 
service, from 1968 to 1978, before opening his private New York firm, Interfor. 
Aviv has worked as a consultant on terrorism and other security issues for large 
corporations and several US government agencies, including the IRS, the FDIC and 
the FBI. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"I was a consultant 
to the FBI for over ten years on anti-terrorism matters," Aviv says. "Once 
I...pointed the finger at the government, I became persona non grata, my arrangements 
with the FBI were canceled. I just became a government enemy."</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Aviv's controversial role 
in the Lockerbie case began in 1989. Relatives of those killed on Pan Am 103 sued 
the airline for negligence in allowing the bomb onto the plane. Pan Am and its 
insurance company hired Aviv to investigate who bombed Flight 103 and how the 
bombers got their lethal baggage past security. Aviv says he tapped sources in 
the intelligence services of several countries and in terrorist groups themselves. 
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"I really got the information 
from the horse's mouth, from people who were involved directly and indirectly 
in the information," Aviv claims.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">His 27-page report for Pan 
Am makes remarkable claims. In 1987, Aviv writes, US agents discovered and began 
monitoring a heroin-smuggling route from the Middle East to the United States, 
via Frankfurt, run by a Syrian drug- and arms-dealer named Monzer al-Kassar. Al-Kassar 
had ties to Hizbollah terrorists who held Western hostages in Beirut. US agents 
agreed to let al-Kassar's heroin operation run â through Frankfurt and London's 
Heathrow airports â in return for al-Kassar's promise to help free hostages. 
<br/>
<br/>
Aviv claims Khalid Jaafar, a young Lebanese-American killed on Pan Am 103, was 
a regular courier for al-Kassar's operation. Ahmed Jibril of the Syria-based PFLP-GC 
knew of al-Kassar's successful drug route when he began plotting with his sponsors 
in Iran to avenge the Vincennes shoot-down, the report asserts. It says Jibril, 
after considering other US carriers, ultimately decided to blow up Pan Am 103 
by, in effect, horning in on al-Kassar's government-controlled smuggling operation. 
The PFLP-GC used Turkish members of extremist groups who worked as baggage handlers 
at the Frankfurt airport to replace Jaafar's heroin bag with a bomb-laden suitcase, 
according to Aviv's scenario. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In response to Aviv's report, 
and investigative news stories based on them, government officials launched an 
attack on Aviv that went well beyond simple denials. In letters to newspaper editors 
and on network TV, diplomatic and intelligence officials called Aviv a "fabricator" 
who had lied about his entire background. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Asked recently to back up 
that characterization, Hurley, formerly of the DEA, faxed us a letter dated May, 
1990. The letter, signed by Yigal Carmon, "Israeli Prime Minister's Advisor 
for Countering Terrorism," says Juval Aviv never worked for Israeli intelligence 
and was fired from a low-level job with El-Al airlines for "dishonesty." 
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The letter is on plain white 
paper, not Israeli government letterhead. We faxed it to the Israeli Embassy in 
Washington DC. A spokeswoman said the letter did not have the look of a letter 
sent from the Office of the Prime Minister. When reached at an office in Tel Aviv, 
Yigal Carmon said he "did not know of anyone called Juval Aviv" and 
refused to discuss the contents of any letter with us.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">A spokesperson for El-Al 
Airlines in Tel Aviv said he was unaware of any such incident of "dishonesty" 
by Juval Aviv, or of any firing of Aviv. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Aviv, for his part, produces 
several documents that he's entered into court refuting the accusation that he 
lied about his background. The documents include an FBI memo about Aviv from 1982, 
obtained through the Freedom of Information Act, and a contract between Aviv and 
the US Justice Department, dated 1984. Both refer to Aviv's past association with 
Israeli intelligence. As late as 1993, an FBI agent wrote to Aviv asking for assistance 
in a tax-recovery investigation, even as other government officials were publicly 
calling Aviv a fabricator. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In public attacks against 
Aviv in the mid-1990's, government officials also pointed out that he'd been arrested 
for alleged mail and wire fraud. The fraud charge was filed in 1994 after an investigation 
by the FBI. The charge: that Aviv had defrauded a corporate client, General Electric 
Capital, in a small contract a few years earlier â that he'd claimed to interview 
people on a fact-finding trip in the Caribbean whom he'd never really interviewed. 
</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But at the trial in 1995 
in the Southern District of New York, Aviv produced records showing that he had 
in fact conducted all the interviews for which he'd billed GE. The jury deliberated 
for just 90 minutes before acquitting Aviv.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">After the verdict, the presiding 
district judge, Louis Stanton, wondered aloud in the courtroom why the FBI had 
gone out of its way to prosecute Aviv given that the alleged victim, GE Capital, 
had filed no complaint. In fact, GE representatives testified that they'd been 
entirely satisfied with Aviv's work. Stanton also pointed out that the fraud charges 
resulted from an investigation by two agents who were working on aspects of the 
Lockerbie case. The judge said those circumstances led him to infer that the fraud 
charge against Aviv "was generated from some other source, and the only source 
in the record so far for which any such purpose could be ascribed is the report 
in the other case, in the Lockerbie case."</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Clearly, none of the government's 
behavior toward Aviv proves that Aviv's claims about the Lockerbie bombing are 
true. Aviv insists that from the start he's been willing to listen to proof that 
his report is all wrong. But Scottish police investigating Lockerbie have never 
interviewed him or asked him for his sources. </font></p>
<p>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">"I was never told directly 
that [my report] was wrong," Aviv says. "I was always attacked as the 
messenger, as somebody who was a fabricator, a lunatic, whatever." </font><br/>
