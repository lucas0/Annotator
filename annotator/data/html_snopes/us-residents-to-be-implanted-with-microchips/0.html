<p>Revelation 13:16-18 is perhaps the section of Scripture that has inspired the most
    conjecture for centuries. Although John's description certainly does leave a great deal of
    interpretive leeway, the proper context in which to approach these verses is from the one
    John wrote from -- a Hebraic Kabbalistic one.</p>
<p>Our review of this material will be broken up as follows: </p><ul>
<li>the "mark" of the beast </li>
<li>"wisdom" and "understanding" </li>
<li>the number "666" </li>
</ul>
</font><p><font size="3"></font><font color="#800000" size="4"><strong>THE "MARK" OF THE BEAST</strong></font><font size="3"></font></p><font size="3">
<p>Although the "mark of the beast" carries a negative connotation, there are a
    several references in Scripture to a "mark" being placed by God on people (or
    property), in order to protect them. </p>
<p>The earliest reference is that placed on Cain:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Genesis 4:15 -</strong> <em>And the Lord said to him, Therefore whoever slays
      Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold. And the Lord set a mark upon Cain, lest
      any finding him should kill him.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another type of protective "mark" was that placed on the doors of the Hebrews
    in Goshen. Note that when "unmitigated judgment" is released (i.e., descending
    from the "left side" directly to Malkut, without being "softened"
    through Tiferet), then even God's people may face physical harm unless they take the
    proper steps.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Exodus 12:7 -</strong> <em>And they shall take of the blood, and strike it on
      the two side posts and on the upper door post of the houses, in which they shall eat it.</em><br/>
<em><br/>
</em><strong>Exodus 12:13 -</strong> <em>And the blood shall be to you for a sign upon the
      houses where you are; and when I see the blood, I will pass over you, and the plague shall
      not be upon you to destroy you, when I strike the land of Egypt.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ezekiel chapter 9 speaks of a "mark" of God on the foreheads of the
    righteous. This parallels the mark (also called "seal") of God seen elsewhere in
    the book of Revelation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Ezekiel 9:4-6 -</strong><em> And the LORD said unto him, Go through the midst
      of the city, through the midst of Jerusalem, and set a mark upon the foreheads of the men
      that sigh and that cry for all the abominations that be done in the midst
      thereof. And to the others he said in mine hearing, Go ye after him through the city,
      and smite: let not your eye spare, neither have ye pity: Slay utterly old and young,
      both maids, and little children, and women: but come not near any man upon whom is the
      mark; and begin at my sanctuary. Then they began at the ancient men which were before the
      house.</em></p>
<p><strong>Revelation 7:3 - </strong><em>Do not harm the land or the sea or the trees
      until we put a seal on the foreheads of the servants of our God.</em></p>
<p><strong>Revelation 9:4 -<em> </em></strong><em>They were told not to harm the grass of the earth
      or any plant or tree, but only those people who did not have the seal of God on their
      foreheads.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Zohar associates the letter Tav (Tau), the last letter of the Hebrew alphabet, with
    the mark mentioned by Ezekiel (above), associating it with the "seal" of God:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Soncino Zohar, Bereshith, Section 1, Page 2b -</strong> <em>IN THE BEGINNING.
      Rab Hamnuna the Venerable said: ‘We find here a reversal of the order of the letters
      of the Alphabet, the first two words Bereshith bara-”in-the-beginning
      He-created”-commencing with beth, whereas the two words following, Elohim
      eth-”God the”-commence with aleph. The reason is as follows. When the Holy One,
      blessed be He, was about to make the world, all the letters of the Alphabet were still
      embryonic, and for two thousand years the Holy One, blessed be He, had contemplated them
      and toyed with them. When He came to create the world, all the letters presented
      themselves before Him in reversed order. The letter Tau advanced in front and pleaded: May
      it please Thee, O Lord of the world, to place me first in the creation of the world,
      seeing that I am the concluding letter of EMeTh (Truth) which is engraved upon Thy seal,
      and seeing that Thou art called by this very name of EMeTh, it is most appropriate for the
      King to begin with the final letter of EMeTh and to create with me the world. The Holy
      One, blessed be He, said to her: Thou art worthy and deserving, but it is not proper that
      I begin with thee the creation of the world, since thou art destined to serve as a mark on
      the foreheads of the faithful ones (vide Ezek. IX, 4) who have kept the Law from Aleph to
      Tau, and through the absence of this mark the rest will be killed; and, further, thou
      formest the conclusion of MaWeTh (death). Hence thou art not meet to initiate the creation
      of the world. </em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The following, from Rabbi Yitzchak Ginsburgh's book on the Hebrew letters, adds deeper
    insight into the meaning of the letter tav and this "seal" of God:</p>
</font><blockquote><font size="3">
</font><p><font size="3"></font><em><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">G</font><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">-d's seal (in Creation) is truth (in Hebrew, emet, spelled out by the final
      letters of the three last words in the account of Creation: bara elokim la'asot,"
      " ...G-d created ‘to do’"). The last letter or seal of the word emet,
      "truth," itself - the seal of G-d's seal - is the letter tav, simple faith, the
      conclusion and culmination of all twenty-two forces - letters - active in Creation. </font><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">T</font><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">he three
      letters which spell emet are the beginning, middle and ending letters of the
      alef-beit." The alef corresponds to one’s initial awareness of Divine paradox in
      the infinite source (where the higher and lower waters, joy and bitterness, are absolutely
      one). From this awareness issues mem, the fountain of Divine wisdom, ever- increasing
      power of insight into the mysteries of Torah. "The final end of knowledge is not to
      know." The culmination of the flow of Divine wisdom in the soul (after all is said
      and done) is the "majestic" revelation of the infinite
      "treasure-house" of simple faith in G-d's absolute omnipresence below innate in
      the soul of Israel. The culmination of truth simple faith is the secret of the
      "tav." ... </font><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">S</font><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">o we are taught: "Torah is the impression [the tav]
      of Divinity; Israel is the impression [the tav] of Torah."</font></em><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"> <sup>1</sup></font><font size="3"></font></p><font size="3">
</font></blockquote><font size="3">
<p>Another text speaks of a good mark that comes from the (right) side of grace:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Soncino Zohar, Bereshith, Section 1, Page 104a</strong> - <em>Said R. Eleazar:
      ‘Observe how merciful the Holy One, blessed be He, shows Himself towards all beings,
      and especially towards those who walk in His paths. For when He is about to execute
      judgement on the world, before doing so He puts in the way of His beloved the occasion of
      performing a good act. We have thus been taught that when the Holy One loves a man, He
      sends him a present in the shape of a poor man, so that he should perform some good deed
      to him, through the merit of which he shall draw to himself a cord of grace from the right
      side which shall wind round his head and imprint a mark on him, so that, when punishment
      falls on the world, the destroyer, raising his eyes and noticing the mark, will be careful
      to avoid him and leave him alone.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This next midrash expounds on Ekekiel's "mark," bringing "the
    prosecution" (adversary=haSatan) into the equation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Midrash Rabbah - Lamentations II:3 - </strong><em>The Holy One, blessed be He,
      never associates His name with what is bad, but only with what is good. Hence it is not
      written here, ‘And concerning these God said in my hearing,’ but, ’And
      concerning these He said in my hearing: Go ye through the city after him, and smite; let
      not your eye spare, neither have ye pity; slay utterly the old man, the young man and the
      maiden, and little children and women; but come not near any man upon whom is the mark;
      and begin at My sanctuary (ib. 5 f.). How can this be? At that time the prosecution sprang
      before the Throne of Glory and spake before Him: ‘Lord of the universe, which of them
      was slain for Thy name? Which of them had his head split open for Thy name? Which of them
      gave his life for Thy name?’</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The following text shows God's "mark" of protection being directly tied to
    the Torah:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Midrash Rabbah - Deuteronomy VII:9 -</strong> <em>God said to Israel:
      ‘When are you called My children? When you receive My words.’ This can be
      compared to a king to whom his son said: ' Set some mark upon me in the land [that people
      should know] that I am your son.’ Whereupon the king replied: ' If you wish that all
      should know that you are my son, then put on my purple cloak and place my crown on your
      head, and all will know that you are my son.’ So God said to Israel: ‘If you
      wish to be distinguished as My children, then occupy yourselves with the [study of the]
      Torah and with the precepts, and all will see that you are My Children. So, when are you
      My children? When you receive My words.’ Rabbi said: When Israel were in the
      wilderness, a pillar of cloud journeyed in front of them, and the smoke of the altar and
      the smoke of the incense went up [towards heaven], and two sparks of fire issued from
      between the two staves of the Ark and devoured in front of them the serpents and
      scorpions; and when the nations of the world saw them they exclaimed: ‘These are
      divine beings, for whatever they do is with fire.’ Thereupon Moses said to Israel: '
      All the distinction which [God caused to be] lavished upon you is only because you have
      accepted His Torah on Sinai.’ </em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The protecive "mark" of God going hand in hand with the Torah is also found
    several places in John's revelation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Revelation 12:17:</strong> <em>And the dragon was enraged with the woman, and
      he went to make war with the rest of her offspring, who keep the <b>commandments</b> of
      God and have the testimony of Yeshua the Messiah.</em></p>
<p><strong>Revelation 14:12:</strong> <em>Here is the patience of the saints; here are
      those who keep the <b>commandments</b> of God and the faith of Yeshua. </em></p>
<p><strong>Revelation 22:14:</strong> <em>Blessed are those who do His <b>commandments</b>,
      that they may have the right to the tree of life, and may enter through the gates into the
      city.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As the "anti-Messiah" is referred to as a man of "Torahlessness" in
    2Thessalonians 2:3, it would seem the criteria people are judged by has a great deal to do
    with their response to and relationship with God's Torah, and not any Torahless
    declaration of "belief" (i.e., Matthew 7:21-24).</p>
<font size="3"><p><font color="#800000" size="4"><strong>WISDOM (CHOKMAH) AND
    UNDERSTANDING (BINAH)</strong></font></p>
<p>Without a doubt, verse 18 is one of the most kabbalistic in the entire "New
    Testament." John expresses the importance of the reader attaining
    "understanding" (Binah) to go along with the "wisdom" (Chokmah) that
    he (John) is imparting. What exactly is this Understanding, how does it relate to Wisdom,
    how does one attain it, and what is the final result?</p>
</font><p><font size="3"></font>In a simple sense, the attribute of Wisdom (Chokmah) is considered to "come
    out of nowhere" (i.e., Keter - the "unknowable" Sefirah), directly from
    God. Thus we see Solomon receiving Wisdom as a gift from God. It may also be said that
    wisdom is associated with the potential given to a person.</p>
<p>Understanding (Binah) however, carries with it the idea of effort on our part.
    Understanding is required to materialize wisdom's potential. Though Solomon had Wisdom, he
    fell into sin due to his lack of Understanding.</p>
<p>The following explanation of Understanding/Binah is by way of author/teacher Aryeh
    Kaplan:</p>
</font><blockquote><font size="3">
<p>The root of Binah is <em>Bin, </em>which is also the root of the word <em>Hitbonenut </em>meaning,
      "making oneself understand," that being contemplating something so deeply and
      completely that one makes himself understand it in all of its aspects. The word is also
      used with respect to God, and in this sense, it is often a preparation for the mystical
      state as seen in verses such as these:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="3"><strong><font color="#000000" size="3">J</font><font color="#000000">ob
        37:14 - </font></strong><font color="#000000"><em>Contemplate (hitbonen) the wonders of God</em></font></font></p>
<p><font size="3"><strong><font color="#000000" size="3">P</font><font color="#000000">salms
        107:43 -<em> </em></font></strong><font color="#000000"><em>Contemplate the love of God</em></font></font></p>
<p><font size="3"><strong><font color="#000000" size="3">P</font><font color="#000000">salms
        119:95-96 -</font></strong><font color="#000000"><em> The wicked waited to destroy me. I contemplate your testimonies.
        I have seen a purpose to every end. Your commandment is very broad</em></font></font></p>
</blockquote>
</font><p><font size="3"></font><font color="#000000" size="3">In Psalm 119 above, the Psalmist is saying that
      from contemplating on the commandments, he is able to perceive their breadth and true
      significance. In general, the word <em>Binah </em>is very closely related to the word <em>Beyn,
      </em>meaning "between." Understanding is then the act of separating something in
      one's mind, examining it by itself. The reflexive<em> Hitbonen,</em> thus means to cause
      oneself to separate something in his mind.</font><font color="#000000" size="2"><sup> 2</sup></font><font size="3"></font></p><font size="3">
</font></blockquote><font size="3">
</font><p><font size="3"></font><font color="#000000" size="3">As discussed in our earlier studies, Binah is
    associated with the number "eight," it being the eighth Sephirah from
    Malkut/Kingdom. The idea of the "eighth" has to do with the "next
    step" beyond the perfection of the physical realm, which is itself associated with
    the number seven. When the number eight is found in Scripture, it often has to do with
    bringing someone or something into the spiritual realm (i.e., circumsicion takes place on
    the eighth day, the Tabernacle and first Temple were dedicated on the eighth days, Psalm
    119 follows a pattern of eight verses for each letter of the Hebrew alphabet</font><font size="3"><font color="#000000">).</font></font></p><font size="3">
</font><p><font size="3"></font><font color="#000000" size="3">Binah and the number eight are also associated
    with the festival of Shavuot, which is observed on the first day of the eighth week (day
    50) following the "first Sabbath" of Passover week. An important concept to
    grasp with regard to this is the idea of our own involvement with "God's will".
    Whereas Passover was entirely God's doing, Shavuot involved work, thought and decisions,
    on the part of His people. As shown in our background studies, the days leading up to
    Shavuot are called the <a href="../fifty-gates.htm"><em>Fifty Gates of Understanding</em></a>,
    and are a time of deep contemplation of God and Torah.</font><font size="3"></font></p><font size="3">
<p><font color="#000000">For a deeper look at this subject, see<em> the kabbalisic text,<a href="palmtree.htm"> The Palm Tree of Deborah; Chapter 4, Attaining the Qualities of Binah</a>.</em></font></p>
</font><p><font size="3"></font><font color="#800000" size="4"><strong>KNOWLEDGE/DA'AT AND THE SIN OF ADAM</strong></font><font size="3"></font></p><font size="3">
<p>Taking this even further, the confluence of Wisdom (considered Abba/Father) and
    Understanding (Imma/Mother) is seen as either Da'at/Knowledge or Tiferet (associated with
    "the Son"). John's instruction makes a connection between attaining da'at and
    calculating the number of the beast. This is indeed a quality of da'at at this level:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Daat is not just the accumulation of the results of chokhmah and binah; it also has
      an active function: to summarize and deduce. It fixes in the soul the picture that is
      absorbed by chokhmah and developed by binah, rendering their constantly changing processes
      into a focused awareness. Daat is thus the faculty to reach conclusions. </em><sup>3</sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>One person who was said to have Wisdom, Understanding and Knowledge, was Bezalel, the
    architect of the Tabernacle. Not only was the Tabernacle the precursor to the Temple and
    place that God would "appear," it also stands as a similar model for our bodies
    being a Temple:</p>
</font><blockquote><font size="3">
</font><p><font size="3"><em>Moses was commanded to build the sanctuary in which God's Divine Presence would be
      revealed on earth. "Behold!" God told him, "I have called upon Bezalel ...
      I have filled him with a Godly Spirit, with Wisdom, Understanding and Knowledge."
      Rashi defines Da'at as ruach hakodesh, divine inspiration. When the powers of Chokmah and
      Binah are combined, Da'at (Knowledge) is attained and a sanctuary is built. This can be
      achieved on an individual level, too. Every person is capable of making himself a Holy
      Temple in which ruach hakodesh can be manifest!</em></font></p>
<p><font size="3"><em>Rabbi Nachman thus taught, "Acquiring Da'at is comparable to
      the building of the Holy Temple, while an absence of Da'at corresponds to its destruction.
      Man's goal must therefore be the pursuit of Da'at to build his own personal sanctuary of
      spirituality, wherein Godliness can be revealed.</em> <sup>4</sup></font></p>
<font size="3">
</font></blockquote><font size="3">
<p>One can therefore make a connection between John's admonition regarding attainment of
    Da'at and the coming of the Millennial Temple. As mentioned in our <a href="http://www.yashanet.com/studies/revstudy/text/r13_1-10.htm">opening notes to Chapter
    13</a>, the creation of the Temple is symbolic of the unification of the Name of God. Thus
    by unifying Wisdom and Understanding in our selves, we serve to hasten the coming of
    Messiah.</p>
<p>Understanding verse 18 as kabbalistic instruction to unify Wisdom and Understanding for
    the purpose of achieving a correct (rectified) state of Knowledge, we see a deeper aspect
    of what is going on with regard to this "beast" and his actions.</p>
<p>As discussed in various places of this study, the anti-messiah places himself in the
    role of the (false) tzaddik (righteous one) thereby coming between the true Bride below
    (Malkut/Shekinah) and Groom above (Tiferet/the Son). This connective role/action is that
    of the Sefirah Yesod, which is between the Bride and the Groom on the kabbalistic Tree of
    Life.</p>
<p>Throughout kabbalistic literature, this idea of separating the bride from the groom is
    directly associated with the sin of Adam. When Adam and Chavah (Eve) ate of the Tree of
    Knowledge (Etz ha-Da'at) they caused this "break" to occur among the Sefirot.
    Thus, Da'at became "corrupted" and in need of tikkun (rectification). This tikun
    occured to a degree at Mount Sinai (with acceptance of the Written Torah by the Jews) and
    continued at the time of Esther and Mordecai (with their acceptance of the Oral Torah). <sup>5</sup></p>
<p>We can therefore draw a direct connection between the events of Gan Edan (with the
    serpent and sin of separating Malkut from the rest of the Sefirot) with those in the end
    of days as depicted by John's account of the beast/anti-messiah. HaSatan comes to finish
    what he started with Adam. The people who "accept his number" place themselves
    in the camp of those taking part in this separation of the Bride from the Groom (i.e., the
    unification of the Name of God as mentioned <a href="r13_1-10.htm">at the beginning of
    this chapter's notes</a>.) </p>
<p>This sin "against the bride" (the Shekinah) is effectively the same as the
    "sin against the Ruach haKodesh" (Holy Spirit), as the latter term is directly
    associated with the Shekinah in both Talmudic and Kabbalistic literature. Just as the sin
    against the Ruach was deemed the "unpardonable sin" by Yeshua, so is there also
    no forgiveness for those who receive the mark of the beast (as John mentions further in
    his revelation).</p>
<p>Refer to our <a href="r2_1-7.htm">previous notes to chapter 2:1-7 on Midag K'neged
    Midah</a> ("measure for measure" punishment) for more on this concept.</p>
<p><strong><font color="#800000" size="4">TEFILLIN - AN ACT OF UNIFICATION</font></strong></p>
<p><font color="#000000">Just as the "beast" causes people to place something on
    their head and/or one upper limb to show their allegiance, there is a "similar"
    action available to the people of God. This is found in </font>"tefillin" -- the
    implements a Jew binds to his head and arm as a means of literally fulfilling a directive
    of the Torah:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Deuteronomy 6:8 -</strong> <em>You shall bind them as a sign on your hand, and
      they shall be as frontlets between your eyes.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#000000">Tefillin serves as a symbol of man's partnership of unifying
    above with below (i.e., the "Groom" and "Bride"), the converse of what
    the "mark of the beast" stands for. What is fascinating is the idea (mentioned
    in the text below) that the tefillin act as a "receiver" for spiritual signals.
    In this sense, the "mark of the beast" may also be a means of transmitting
    spiritual powers of the Sitra Atra (evil realm) into our world.</font></p>
</font><p><font size="3"><font color="#000000" face="times">T</font></font><font color="#000000" face="times" size="3">he following text from Aryeh Kaplan sheds some light on the essence of tifillin:</font><font size="3"></font></p><font size="3">
<blockquote>
<p><font color="#000000"><em><font face="times" size="3">Have you ever felt so close to
      another human being that every moment together was precious? Where every letter and
      memento from this person was something to be treasured? What if this person gave you a
      meaningful gift? Every time you looked at it or used it, would it not remind you of this
      special relationship? </font><font face="arial, helvetica, geneva" size="3">... </font><font face="times" size="3">Tefillin are a sign of this bond between G-d and man. Faith and love
      are very tenuous things. We can speak of them and think about them. But unless we do
      something about them we tend to forget; Tefillin serve to help us remember. The essence of
      the Torah is its commandments, Mitzvos in Hebrew. The word Mitzvah comes from the root
      meaning "to bind." Every commandment or mitzvah serves to draw us close to G-d
      and strengthen this connection. With every Mitzvah we forge a spiritual bond with G-d. In
      the case of Tefillin, this bond is physical as well as spiritual. We literally bind G-d's
      love symbol to our bodies. Thus, our sages teach us that the commandment of Tefillin
      encompasses all others. Here, we can actually see and feel the bond. G-d has given us the
      commandment of Tefillin and clearly spelled out how to do it. Tefillin may seem like
      simple boxes and straps. But they are much, much more. When a man wears Tefillin, he binds
      himself to the very highest spiritual level. He achieves a closeness to G-d that even the
      deepest meditation could not accomplish. Of course, when a man wears Tefillin and also
      contemplates their significance, his very thoughts are elevated close to G-d. But even the
      physical act in itself can bring a man to the loftiest heights. We can also understand
      this in a much simpler sense. In order to create this bond, our Tefillin must conform
      exactly to G-d's design. The slightest deviation breaks this link. A good analogy is that
      of a radio. A radio is specifically designed to receive a particular type of signal. Every
      element in it is needed for this. Cut a single wire, remove a single capacitor, no matter
      how small, and you no longer receive the signal. There are precise rules by which a radio
      must be built. These include all the laws of electromagnetism and circuits. If these are
      not exactly followed, the radio will not function. Tefillin are our receiver for a
      specific spiritual signal. As such, they must be designed to receive this particular kind
      of signal. Violate a single rule, and they become like a radio with a transistor removed.
      The bond just no longer exists. We can carry the analogy still further. You would have to
      have an extensive scientific education to even begin to understand how a radio works. You
      would have to know calculus and differential equations and all the complexities of
      electromagnetic theory. But still, even the youngest child can turn on a radio. The same
      is true of the Mitzvos. A lifetime of study might lead you to begin to understand their
      significance But anyone can put them on and receive the signal. </font><font face="times"><sup>6</sup></font></em></font></p>

</font><p><font size="3"><font color="#000000">T</font></font><font color="#000000" size="3">he number
    "666" is of course the centerpiece to this section. This number has been the
    source of misguided speculation for centuries. Again, any attempt to understand this
    number, apart from the Hebrew-Kabbalistic context from which John writes, will lead to
    error. As mentioned above, a key is "Binah" - understanding - which comes from
    study of Torah at its deepest levels.</font><font size="3"></font></p><font size="3">
</font><p><font size="3"></font><font color="#000000" size="3">We will analyze this mysterious number</font><font size="3"><font color="#000000"> in the following fashion:</font> </font></p><ol type="I"><font size="3">
<li><font color="#000000" size="3">the number six</font> </li>

        "six-hundred sixty six"</font> </li>
</font></ol><font size="3">
<p><font color="#800000"><strong>I - THE NUMBER "6"</strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000" size="3">T</font><font color="#000000">he concepts associated
    with the number 6 are foundational to understanding this passage. Unfortunately,
    commentaries miss the point when addressing this. A common teaching is the number six is
    "bad" as it is "the number of man," whereas seven is "good"
    as it is "the number of God." As interesting as that may sound it has no basis
    in Torah and has nothing to do with where John is coming from.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">"Six" is no more or less "Godly" than seven.
    In fact, the number six is closely associated with both God and the Messiah, and it is for
    this reason that it is closely associated with the anti-Messiah, as he comes as a
    counterfeit. In contrast to the above idea of six being a "bad" number, an
    argument could even be made that the number six is more closely associated with God than
    any other number.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">An explanation of this is found in a prominent kabbalistic text,
    regarding the (sixth) Sephirah of Tiferet and the third letter of the name YHVH (the
    "vav" - with a numerical value of six). As seen in the following citations, the
    "vav" is said to "stand in place of the complete Name" of YHVH:</font></p>
<blockquote>
<p><font color="#000000"><em>The essence of the third letter</em> <em>is the essence of
      the letter vav, and it includes the six Spheres which are the numerical equivalent of the
      letter vav </em>[six], <em>three above, which is half of vav and three of its other half
      below. The three of the upper half are Gedulah </em>(also called Hesed),<em> Gevurah and
      Tiferet and the three Spheres on the lower half are Netzach, Hod and Yesod. All these
      Spheres are included in the letter vav. Behold, the letter vav of the special Name (YHVH)
      stands in place of the complete Name. ... This letter contains the secret of tying all the
      upper and lower Spheres.  It ascends to Keter and descends to Malchut and it suits
      all the Spheres., for all are united in it whether they be above or below, to the right or
      to the left, and it is called the center line. ... Know that this great Name YHVH is the
      attribute the Kabbalsits call the Middle Line. ... The meaning of the term "the
      Middle Line" is the essence of the letter vav that is found in the Name YHVH, for it
      stands in the place where the Name is. It is like an intermediary line, thus this name
      ascends ever upward until AYN SOF (the infinte), which is the essence of Keter and unites
      with the name EHYE, which is the essence of the Heavenly Line and then returns to unite
      below with the Name Adonay. After this He returns and extends to the sides, and all sides
      from every direction hold fast toHim. One finds that the letter vav of the Name YHVH, may
      He be blessed, stands in the place of the whole Name, and to it all the other Names hold
      fast.</em> <sup>7</sup></font></p>
</blockquote>
</font><p><font size="3"><font color="#000000"><font size="3">As shown above, </font>one of the chief ideas
    associated with the vav is the idea of connection - specifically connecting the heavenly
    and earthly realms. (Note that at the physical level, the vav is in the shape of a hook.)
    The six Sephirot of;</font></font><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"> Hesed, Gevurah,
    Tiferet, Netzah, Hod and Yesod (known collectively by the term <em>Ze'er Anpin </em>and
    singly represented by Tiferet - "the Son"),<em> </em></font><font color="#000000" size="3">serve as the connection between the Throne room of God
    (represented by Binah) at one "end," and the physical realm below (represented
    by </font><font size="3"><font color="#000000">Malkhut) at the other "end."</font></font></p><font size="3">
<p><font color="#000000">This idea of unifying the heavens and earth is also associated
    with the tzaddik (righteous person) specifically <em>Messiah ben Joseph. </em>The
    following text illustrates the vav as a pillar, specifically the middle pillar of truth as
    represented by the tzaddik:</font></p>
<blockquote>
<p><font color="#000000" size="3"><strong>Soncino Zohar, Shemoth, Section 2, Page 51b -</strong>
<em>AND THE PILLAR OF THE CLOUD REMOVED FROM BEFORE THEM AND STOOD BEHIND THEM. What was
      this pillar of cloud? R. Jose said that it was the cloud which is always seen with the
      Shekinah, the cloud into which Moses entered (Ex. XXIV, 18). R. Abba said that it was that
      which supports the Zaddik.</em></font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This idea of the link between a "cloud" and a great Tzaddik, might shed new
    light on certain verses in the New Testament:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Matthew 17:5 </strong>- <em>While he was still speaking, behold, a bright cloud
      overshadowed them; and suddenly a voice came out of the cloud, saying, "This is My
      beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. Hear Him!"</em></p>
<p><strong>Matthew 24:30 -</strong> <em>Then the sign of the Son of Man will appear in
      heaven, and then all the tribes of the earth will mourn, and they will see the Son of Man
      coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory.</em></p>
<p><strong>Acts 1:9 -</strong> <em>Now when He had spoken these things, while they
      watched, He was taken up, and a cloud received Him out of their sight.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#000000">As discussed in earlier studies, the tzaddik is associated with
    the Sephirah of Yesod, which is the sixth of the seven "lower" Sephirot. Yesod
    is seen as the connecting point" between Malkut and the upper remaining Sephirot. You
    could say that Yesod determins how much or little (if any) of God's blessings make it
    "down to us below." With a righteous Messiah in the role of Yesod, these
    blessings come full force -- with a false messiah allowed to stand in, it is only a matter
    of time before judgment befalls the world. <sup>8</sup></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">Note the relationship between the Sephirah of Tiferet, which is
    the sixth of the totality of the ten Sephirot and which is associated with Jacob, and the
    Sephirah of Yesod, which is the sixth of the lower seven Sefirot and associated with
    Joseph.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">The following texts speak to the mirror image relationship
    between these two patriarchs and their related Sefirot:</font></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Soncino Zohar, Bereshith, Section 1, Page 180a -</strong> <em>THESE ARE THE
      GENERATIONS OF JACOB: JOSEPH, ETC. When Jacob was brought to rest in Joseph, and so the
      sun was united with the moon, then there commenced a production of offspring, the
      progenitor being Joseph. For it is that perennially flowing stream which fructifies the
      earth and from which generations are propagated in the world. For the sun, even when he
      approaches the moon, cannot cause vegetation without the help of that grade which goes
      under the name of Righteous (Zaddik). It was, then, Joseph who was the grade of Jacob to
      bear fruit and bring forth offspring in the world. Hence: “These are the generations
      (tol'doth, lit. offspring) of Jacob: Joseph.” Or, again, we may take the words to
      signify that whoever looked at Joseph thought he was looking at Jacob. Hence this form of
      expression is used only in connection with Joseph and not with any other of Jacob's
      sons-it is not written, for instance, “These are the offspring of Jacob:
      Reuben”, the reason being that Joseph was the exact image of his father.</em></p>
<p><strong>Soncino Zohar, Bereshith, Section 1, Page 176b - </strong><em>The Shekinah was
      thus leagued with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob together with Joseph, inasmuch as the two
      latter are one in essence, each one being the image of the other, as indicated in the
      words: “These are the offspring of Jacob: Joseph” (Gen. XXXVII, 2).</em></p>
<p><strong>Soncino Zohar, Bereshith, Section 1, Page 173a -</strong> <em>But now that Esau
      is biting him and his children, who will stand up against him? Jacob and Joseph, one on
      one side and the other on the other side. So Scripture says: “And the house of Jacob
      shall be a fire, and the house of Joseph a flame, and the house of Esau for stubble,
      etc.” (Oba. I, 18).</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#800000"><strong>II. THE THREE NUMBERS OF 600 AND 60 AND 6</strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">The mathematical relationship between these numbers is simple; 60
    is10 times 6, and 600 is 10 times 60. This prompts two questions:</font> </p><ul>
<li><font color="#000000">What is the significance of ten times a number?</font> </li>
<li><font color="#000000">Why a set of three numbers?</font> </li>
</ul>
</font><p><font size="3"></font><font color="#000000" size="3">One of the other key meanings associated with the
    vav is </font><em><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">the power which links together the
    souls of Israel.</font></em><font face="Times New Roman" size="2"><sup> 9</sup></font><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">  The soul is typically associated with the six
    "emotive" Sefirot of; Hesed, Gevurah, Tiferet, Netzah, Hod and Yesod (the six of
    which are also known as <em>Ze'er Anpin). </em></font><font size="3"></font></p><font size="3">
</font><p><font size="3"></font><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Within the worlds of creation, our souls
    exist simulaneously Asiyyah, Yetzirah and Beriah. The soul has a relationship with the
    Sefirot at each level of "existence" and is said to have the potential of
    bringing peace to all worlds -- even that of the higher Divine world of Atzilut.<sup> </sup></font><font face="Times New Roman" size="2">10</font><font size="3"></font></p><font size="3">
<p><font face="Times New Roman">HaSatan seeks to impact our souls in each of these worlds.
    (Recall that his desire is to "be like the Most High.") Thus, he wishes to be
    the "vav" that unites all worlds. It is interesting to note that just as our
    souls are rectified in the three worlds of creation, God's rectification of creation
    itself is effected through three sets of judgments as explained <a href="r6_1-8.htm">in
    chapter 6 of this study</a>.</font></p>
</font><p><font size="3"></font><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Looking even deeper, the numbers 60 and
    600 have an interesting relationship in kabbalah. The numerical value of the letter Samech
    is 60 while 600 is the value of the "final Mem" (a Mem that comes at the end of
    a word as opposed to a regular Mem whose numerical value is 40).</font><font face="Times New Roman" size="2"><sup> 11</sup></font><font size="3"></font></p><font size="3">
</font><p><font size="3"></font><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">Once again we turn to Rabbi Ginsburgh's
    book on the Hebrew letters</font><font face="Times New Roman" size="2"><sup><em> </em>12</sup></font><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">:</font><font size="3"></font></p><font size="3">
</font><blockquote><font size="3">
</font><p><font size="3"></font><em><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">The only completely "closed"
      letters in the Hebrew alphabet are the samech and the final mem, the circle and the
      square. As the engraved letters of the "tablets of covenant" given to Moses at
      Sinai penetrated through the tablets from "side to side," the
      "insides" of these two letters, being entirely closed, were suspended in
      mid-air, within the stone of the tablets. "Rabbi Chisda said: the mem and samech of
      the tablets stood miraculously.'" In kabbalah it is explained that these two letters
      are the secret of the two levels of the future revelation of Divinity of Souls. The closed
      mem is called "the Coming World," and the samech is called "the Future to
      Come." The Future to Come is an even higher revelation than that of the Coming World.
        ... The Future to Come, the secret of the samech, is the absolute revelation of the
      future, incomprehensible at present.: "No eye has seen it, G-d, except yours."
      According to one tradition based upon this teaching of kabbalah, the wedding ring placed
      by the groom on the "pointing" (index) finger of the bride, is in the form of a
      circle (samech) inside a square (final mem). The "pointing" finger of the bride
      points at the revelation of the future, the Future to Come within the Coming World. </font><font face="Times New Roman" size="2"><sup>13</sup></font></em><font size="3"></font></p><font size="3">
</font></blockquote><font size="3">
<p>The relational aspects of the numbers 6, 60 and 600, with regard to our souls, may be
    seen as follows: </p><ul>
<li>In Asiyyah: the six emotive Sephirot of the soul (which in turn are associated with the
        six "constant commandments" that are not bound by time or space)<sup> 14</sup></li>
<li>In Yetzirah: the six emotive Sephirot revealed within each of these ten Sephirot = 60 </li>
<li>In Beriah: the sixty relationships of Yetzirah (above) within each of these ten Sephirot
        = 600 </li>
</ul>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Now we see how the multipying factor of 10 comes into
    play. This is similar to the ten menorot Solomon placed in the Temple, representing how
    all ten Sefirot are present within each individual Sefirah.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">As stated by Rabbi </font>Yitzchak Ginsburgh:</p>
</font><blockquote><font size="3">
</font><p><font size="3"></font><em><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">... ten times a number alludes, in
      Kabbalah, to its full revelation in all the ten powers of the soul, which correspond to
      the ten supernal sefirot, the channels by which God created the world. </font></em><font face="Times New Roman" size="2"><sup>15</sup></font><font size="3"></font></p><font size="3">
</font></blockquote><font size="3">
</font><p><font size="3"><font color="#000000">Recall in the previous section of notes that Nebuchadnezzar's
    idol is linked to the generation of the Tower of Babel in that each wished to connect
    "below" to "above." This explains why Nebuchadnezzar's statue had the
    peculiar dimensions of 6 by 60. The addition of 600 to the number of the beast may
    indicate his continuation of </font></font><font color="#000000" size="3">Nebuchadnezzar's
    </font><font size="3"><font color="#000000">plan and/or greater success in challenging the
    very throne of God.</font></font></p><font size="3">
<p><font color="#000000">Another interesting fact that connects these three numbers
    involves the ancient Babylonian numbering system (used at the time of Nebuchadnezzar). As
    explained in a popular mathematics textbook:</font></p>
<blockquote>
<p><font color="#000000"><em>The babylonians wrote their numbers in a system based on
      sixty, in the same way we write ours based on ten.</em> <sup>16</sup></font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#000000">For an insightful analysis of multiples of six and tens in this
    context see Rabbi Pinchas Winston's essay, <em><a href="http://www.thirtysix.org/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=340&amp;mode=thread&amp;order=0&amp;thold=0">Since
    You Asked ... About The Number 600,000</a>.</em></font></p>
<p><strong><font color="#800000">III. </font><font color="#800000" size="3">TH</font><font color="#800000">E TOTAL NUMBER OF "SIX HUNDRED, SIXTY-SIX"</font></strong></p>
<p><font color="#000000">As seen in an earlier study, gemmatria is useful in revealing
    hidden dimensions in numbers. <a href="r12_1-6.htm">In that previous example</a> we showed
    how the number 153 was linked to both Betzalel and Yeshua, and how 153 is the
    "triangle" of 17 (the sum of all the numbers from 1 to 17). The number 17 in
    turn is associated with the idea of joining the spiritual (represented by the number 10)
    to the physical (represented by the number 7).</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">In this chapter we have the number 666, which is the triangle of
    the number 36 (the sum of the numbers 1 through 36). The number 36 is significant in
    kabbalah as it is associated with the idea of 36 tzaddikim (righteous ones) that sustain
    the world at any given time.</font></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Sanhedrin 97b, Sukkot 45b - </strong><em>There are not less than thirty-six
      tzaddikim/righteous persons in the world who receive the Shekhinah/the Divine Presence</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#000000">It is further taught that these thirty-six tzaddikim possess
    insight into the Divine order of the universe unknown to the rest of us, hold mystical
    powers, and that one of them may emerge as the Messiah. This theme is reflected at
    Chanukkah, where a total of 36 candles are lit over the course of eight days. </font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">It may not be surprising to learn that 36 is the triangle of 8,
    which itself is associated with the World to Come - the Olam Haba. (See notes on
    Understanding/Binah and the number "8" above.)</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">Just as 153 represents the fullness of the "connective"
    number 17, and assists in identifying an especially righteous person, the number 666 may
    act in the same fashion toward 36, only in a counterfeit manner.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">Finally, <a href="../rev6g.htm">as shown in our background study
    of the Sefirot</a>, there is an amazing metaphysical revelation found within the
    kabbalistic Tree of Life diagram that relates to everything discussed so far.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">There are several traditions concerned with the twenty-two
    "paths" found between the ten Sefirot on the Tree of Life. Each of these
    methodologies assigns one of the twenty-two Hebrew letters to each of these paths.
    Although the "best known" system of numerology is that found in the classic
    text, <em>Sefer Yetzirah</em> (literally "Book of Formation", often called
    "Book of Creation"), there is another method based in the influential Spanish
    (Toledano) school of the middle ages. <sup>17</sup></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">In the Toledano tradition, the path from Binah to Gevurah
    (heading down the left side) is linked to the Vav, which has a numerical value of 6.
    Descending from Gevurah down to Hod we have the letter Samech, with a value of 60.
    Finishing the path down the left side, between Hod and Malkut at the bottom, is the letter
    Tav, which has the value of 400. The entirety of the three links of this path therefore
    has a value of 466. </font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">Compare this journey along the left side to the
    "descent" of haSatan, who is cast from the heavenly realm (Binah) down to earth
    (Malkut). He does remain stagnant here however. As seen in the text of Revelation, and
    expounded on in our notes, from Malkut he elevates himself to the level of Yesod, in the
    role of the great (but false) Tzaddik.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">This "ascent" from Malkut back up to Yesod, is along
    the path associated with the letter Resh, having a numerical value of 200. Thus, the
    entire "journey" of haSatan from the Throne Room to his misleading the world,
    comes to a total value of 666 (Vav-Samech-Tav-Resh = 6+60+200+400).</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">This section of the study merits further study and, Lord willing,
    will be updated at some point.</font></p>
