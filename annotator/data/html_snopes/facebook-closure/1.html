<p>PALO ALTO, CA –Mark Zuckerberg announced that Facebook will be shut down in March. Managing the site has become too stressful.<span id="more-27321"></span></p>
<p>“Facebook has gotten out of control,” said Zuckerberg in a press conference outside his Palo Alto office, “and the stress of managing this company has ruined my life. I need to put an end to all the madness.”</p>
<p>Zuckerberg went on to explain that starting March 15th, users will no longer be able to access their Facebook accounts.</p>
<p>“After March 15th the whole website shuts down,” said Avrat Humarthi, Vice President of Technical Affairs at Facebook. “So if you ever want to see your pictures again, I recommend you take them off the internet. You won’t be able to get them back once Facebook goes out of business.”</p>
<p>Zuckerberg said that the decision to shut down Facebook was difficult, but that he does not think people will be upset.</p>
<p>“I personally don’t think it’s a big deal,” he said in a private phone interview. “And to be honest, I think it’s for the better. Without Facebook, people will have to go outside and make real friends. That’s always a good thing.”</p>
<p>Some Facebook users were furious upon hearing the shocking news.</p>
<p>“What am I going to do without Facebook?” said Denise Bradshaw, a high school student from Indiana. “My life revolves around it. I’m on Facebook at least 10 hours a day. Now what am I going to do with all that free time?”</p>
<p>However, parents across the country have been experiencing a long anticipated sense of relief.</p>
<p>“I’m glad the Facebook nightmare is over,” said Jon Guttari, a single parent from Detroit. “Now my teenager’s face won’t be glued to a computer screen all day. Maybe I can even have a conversation with her.”</p>
<p>Those in the financial circuit are criticizing Zuckerberg for walking away from a multibillion dollar franchise. Facebook is currently ranked as one of the wealthiest businesses in the world, with economists estimating its value at around 7.9 billion.</p>
<p>But Zuckerberg remains unruffled by these accusations. He says he will stand by his decision to give Facebook the axe.</p>
<p>“I don’t care about the money,” said Zuckerberg. “I just want my old life back.”</p>
<p>The Facebook Corporation suggests that users remove all of their personal information from the website before March 15th. After that date, all photos, notes, links, and videos will be permanently erased.

So if fb closes down on Mar 15... Great news! Zucks got his life back!!! (And hopefully those of us who make a living off community site hosting stand a chance!!!)<br/><br/>Get the f%*k outta here fb...

<p>It's because of the law suit where Mark Zuckerberg stole the other person's ideas, you know, just like Bill Gates…but Czx is right…it's a monetary leviathan so it probably won't have to shut down and like Microsoft and other big corporations with lots of bribe money will get to keep on running without any kind of regulation enforcement or responsibility whatsoever.  Facebook STILL doesn't have a Contact Us page!! So just like its big theiving brother, Microsoft it's not beholden to its users.</p>

<p>Hey guess what, you have the free choice not to engage in facebook, or with Microsoft.  As such, you shouldn't give a damn if they don't have a "Contact Us" link.  It's like any business.  they offer a service and if you don't like it, don't engage the service with them.  It's called the free market..</p>

<p>It is fake but I like some of the ideas. At least where I am at they blocked it.  Students are actually using Microsoft office to write reports. Before that time all serious students who needed a machine were out of luck waiting for the facebooker to give up the machine. You should see how angry they were that you were standing behind waiting for the last word they type on that site. I wish this was true lol and printed on a real news site.</p>

<p>I hope they don't close it.  I have being able to find many family, friends and loved on through facebook.  I also have being able to minister the Word of God to many in the USA and other Nations.  Facebook is a good thing if you know how to manage your time and do things right.  I pray that it does not shut down.</p>

<p>Closing facebook won’t be as easy as it looks, its become a part of millions daily life. If it does down, people won’t give up on social networking, there are other options available, such as orkut, friendster, ibibo etc etc.. To be on the safer side, back up the pics and contact details..</p>

<p>I guess FB has weakened the real social bonds, of course in addition to the lack of privacy (be it optional or not) .. FB exposes people’s private life whether ur a user of FB or not !</p>

<p>This is some bull he doesn't have the right to say whether or not we should be on facebook some of us don't revolve our world around it, now we have to go back to freaking myspace. if he's having such a hard time running his business let someone else man enough for the job do it! and fyi i do make friends in the real world not everyone is a freaking robot, facebook just makes communication easier.</p>

Facebook is a good thing if you know how to manage your time and do things right. I usually go on to  play games.. isnt it better to sell it to someone else then too shut it down..</p>

Even outside the internet world… we expose things to people such as what we say and what we do…problems start outside of facebook…. u cud get kidnap anytime no joke… or get in a fight anytime so closing facebook isn't gonna make a difference in the society.. jus my opinion and im in high school.</p>

<p>why to close it it's not only about chat or kids around it all the time for me it's business i'm a school teacher and a do have a chance to connect them by our schools activities and pictures posted on facebook and we announce our events and survey our activities and services to students by facebook and we post our events pictures on it students get interacted with it i think that make a stronger bond between students, teachers and school<br/>
i'm so upset for shutting down facebook and for parents they can monitor their kids easily on it<br/>
it's not that much hassle</p>

<p>fb is not only a page to find friends </p>
<p>it connects people around the world<br/>
it connects you with your family-how would you go out and se your cousin or your aunt when they live 3000km away – facebook helps to miss less persons you love very much</p>

<p>this is obviously a fake. </p>
<p>a) i dont think you can shut down something like facebook, even if your the owner of it. Think about it, facebook is the 2nd most used site on the internet, and over 600million users. You just can't shut down something like that. If mark zuckerberg wants to call quits, then he would sell it, not destroy it. </p>
<p>b) I don't think I would trust a site that involves articles about aliens and mutants.</p>

<p>Mr. Zuckerberg really earned his retirement and i thank him for his invention of facebook, grat job, i really loved facebook<br/>
We made new friends in facebook and that was good, but if you have hundred or thousand friends you don't really know, i think that was not the sense of facebook, we have to hold real life and the life in the internet appart and took the experience from facebook and use it in the real life and this will bring us a brighter future, live your life and enjoy it<br/>
I think when facebook is shutdown for five months or more, you wouldn't really recognize that there was something like facebook, you will be free!</p>

<p>Fake page. First of all the guy in the picture is not Zuckerberg. Secondly the statistics are wrong, face book is worth much more. Mark’s personal wealth is only 7 billion Dollars. There is no such kid on the facebook as mentioned in the report. There is no employee in Facebooks team as mentioned in the report. Moreover mark is least bothered abt the work as he has hundreds of employees to take care of all the work. He is just bzy spending all his money. People plz give a second thought to whatever u read or hear. Use ur common sense. THank you. </p>

<p>Guys , we should be coucious as this might be true , so I think u all take a copy for all ur pics &amp; all important thing in case this really happened , and I sugget that face book admins to send a worning message perioer the mentioned day to be able to take back ups for their data , as a face book normal user we need an official announcement to our mails or accounts to make the our back ups, regards.</p>

<p>Where did this come from? Do you realise how many frameworks,businesses and websites that depend on FB’s user datapool? Do you know how many shareholders there are in facebook for zuckerberg to go ahead and over-ride them to shut down the website?</p>
<p>I think this is false. I do think that if Zuckerberg wanted to get his life back, he’d just sell his part of the company and move on. It wud be amateurish of him to just shut it down and everyone will be happy….Lawsuits &amp; petitions will follow.</p>

<p>thank you! shutting it down is an idiotic idea, financially. If the people stress you out then the money he gets from it won't.</p>

<p>This is ridiculous, I think facebook is brilliant invention to be in touch with friends and find people who you may have lost and miss. You know that there will be then another website like fb, so why the hell shut this thing down? Just wondering whats the point of this.</p>

<p>it's good to know that fb is closing down coz it might help our kids education and now UKs government has made education harder anyway and you have given our kids a chance to concentrate on studies instead of being glued to the screen 24×7. I was worried about my boy but before he could get old enough to find FB it's getting closed.. I feel like I've got my son back! LOL</p>

<p>One new networking option is Truebook.org . It is still in beta and down form time to time, but it is looking good and you can find more about it by searching on the name.  </p>
<p>An other is Diaspora*, but it is more complex, because you have to set up a site on a server to make it work.</p>

<p>Mr Smith this decision is really very unpredictable , when you are facing so much difficulties then you should take some other way round to manage it , same if a life of a person gets hectic than there is a simple way of suicide means quit but he one on't do like this . So it's a request to you to plzz think on your decision once more ad try to elaborate some other idea to continue it..</p>

<p>balls .. he can't just shut down facebook coz he wants to .. he doesn't own all the shares .. he only owns about 30% or even less .. he can take his share of money and walk .. the other companies that have invested in it won't let it shut down .. i bet google will buy it or make a new one like that ..</p>

<p>please reconsider shutting down the site, i ahve been able to reconnect with friend i had lost contact with years ago with the help of thiss ite . this will be a disaster for many like me. its not just asite where people while away time facebook is more than what it was originally intended for …it brings people back together.</p>

<p>okay I understand that fb can be addictive and stressful but to close it down is an idiots idea, sell it because it’s a usefull tool that millions of people use everyday. business’s and bands need it to contact the consumer and our local skate park has been kept open thanks to the links between people on fb and the support that a group on fb provided. sell the company, it’s worth billions and it’s too usefuller tool to jut throw away, you don’t see a lawyer throwing away his law books because it stressful to read them? he keeps them so liberate the innocent people and uses them as a useful tool. xxx</p>

All my family members Ąre there both near and far and its the easiest, fastest, and most reliable way of tracking pals near and far. Pls have ą rethink. God bless U all</p>

<p>he rili made sense wen  he said "I personally don’t think it’s a big deal,” he said in a private phone interview. “And to be honest, I think it’s for the better. Without Facebook, people will have to go outside and make real friends. That’s always a good thing.”..and with that i am supporting him..but i still don'y know why he would walk out from a business so successful?</p>

<p>I seriously hope this is a publicity stunt..!! why would you close down facebook..? asides from being a social network,it is also a medium of information and communication for people…it helps me keep in touch with a lot of my friends and families who are outside the country or who I’ve lost touch with…I think it is unfair for Mark to create this site only to shut it down leaving us with a vaccum that might not be filled by another social network..!!! if Mark wants his old life back,let him sell the frachise off to someone else..!!! He can’t just leave us blank..!!!</p>

<p>It's pretty fucking pathetic how people's lives revolve around fucking Facebook. I know this is a fake article, but reading the comments has really opened my eyes to how fucked up this generation is. People are saying that their life is Facebook… you need lives, honestly. Even though this is a fake article, there are good points in it. Because of Facebook, so many people have no lives and no friends. It's not even that much of a good website. People who have been on Facebook for over four years like myself will agree with me on that.<br/>
So yeah. I wish it was shutting down. Maybe then the majority of children on Facebook will get to experience the great outdoors and make some friends.</p>

<p>Mark, it might be a good idea to close it now but, i promise,  you will regret taking this step later. Besides, its not just about you anymore, the whole world is involved. So, as a good fan, i will suggest you sell it to capable hands if you cant continue and who knows, 2mao, if everything goes well you can look up and say…., i actually created FACEBOOK and sold it later!</p>

<p>you right.there is allway's a way to solve problems and the way to solve mark's problem is to shut down facebook.if people can live through the death of their child or  being raped,if people overcome depressions and illness you and another millions who "can't live without it" will live through the fact that you will have to make some real friends like mark said.their are much worst things so start watching the news and start reading the papers and get some prespctive  i beg you!….</p>

<p>i hope that's is not true facebook is not  a regular social network it changed alot of things in our social life and being more connected to the people around us and the most important point  ; facebook became window for millions of people to the world news, moreover it makes people to reconsider the important of knowledge specially now it is very easy to find any information we are seeking for on the groups or pages  however it’s for education , entrainment  or just for fun .<br/>
etc ………</p>

<p>i know we can do that through any other network, but we have to confess that facebook makes the world to be in one place and on one click far. i believe it is not fair to waste all this effort and success . and excuse me now it is not your choice alone we are your clients and you have to respect our opinion so please before deciding on this send the users a survey , and am sure about the result.<br/>
The last point you should also consider is that there is billions of business now depend on facebook so if your final decision is to shut down the notice period should be longer to give those people who trusted you and invested their money on your network there time to take their action and save their business from unexpected failure. Finally i hope to rethink about it and take the right decision.<br/>
GOOD LUCK</p>

<p>I think that this is a big joke, If he is not happy with managing fb, why He doesn't accept nice offer and sell facebook… He must be a fool to do that <img alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" src="http://web.archive.org/web/20110109052415im_/http://s2.wp.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif?m=1235145237g"/> </p>
<p>But If it's true I'm happy with this solution <img alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" src="http://web.archive.org/web/20110109052415im_/http://s2.wp.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif?m=1235145237g"/> </p>
<p>Ending facebook virtual life means bringing back our normal socializing…</p>

<p>i hope that's is not true facebook is not  a regular social network it changed alot of things in our social life and being more connected to the people around us and the most important point  ; facebook became window for millions of people to the world news, moreover it makes people to reconsider the important of knowledge specially now it is very easy to find any information we are seeking for on the groups or pages  however it’s for education , entrainment  or just for fun .<br/>
 Etc…………………</p>

<p>If people are addicted to Facebook they could always  delete it. I love Facebook. I've been able to talk to people who I haven't seen in a while, talk to family who live across the country, and made friends with people from my school I would have never thought about  talking to in person. You say we won't be glued to the comp. all day? Hey, maybe your right, We'll be out there exploring the world. But is that a good thing for some teenagers? Without Facebook some teens might be doing some naughty things rather then having a nice conversation with their mother. I've always thought of Facebook as a distraction away from that.</p>

<p>Another important thing that I met my soul mate through F.B , we became friends then met each other … engaged … now am married to him since 3 months and am really happy … and that because of F.B …. and now this is not a personal issue ,,, you cant just open a site and make us attached to it and then took a step without thinking about users and just Delete it its really a big deal to us …<br/>
so please do not delete it</p>

<p>. i know we can do that through any other network, but we have to confess that facebook makes the world to be in one place and on one click far. i believe it is not fair to waste all this effort and success . and excuse me now it is not your choice alone we are your clients and you have to respect our opinion so please before deciding on this send the users a survey , and am sure about the result.<br/>
The last point you should also consider is that there is billions of business now depend on facebook so if your final decision is to shut down the notice period should be longer to give those people who trusted you and invested their money on your network there time to take their action and save their business from unexpected failure. Finally i hope to rethink about it and take the right decision.<br/>
GOOD LUCK</p>

<p>wth wouls you shut down facebook ?<br/>
if its causingg you so much stress &amp; its getting out of control , why did you even create it in the first place ???<br/>
you should already know that people need a social networkingg site to stay " not bored "<br/>
since your the one that created fb , then i say you should deal w/ the stress .</p>

<p>I strongly disagree with the disabling of facebook. My brother was deployed overseas and although we email each other, FB is one of the only ways for him to stay connected with our family. When he sees us through facebook, he knows EXACTLY what is going on me, my mom, dad, sister, his friends, etc. ALL at once, instead of ONLY being allowed to talk to him MAYBE once a week. Perhaps if the business is becoming too much for Mark Z, he should sell it instead of ending it for everyone because I know a lot of other families who benefit from it in the same way. As well as staying connected with my brother, its an EXCELLENT way of networking! Two recommendation letters have come my way by conversing with associates and various people through facebook.</p>

<p>hey there! I don’t think Its a good idea! Because some people use it for business  and keep the friendship on! I’m my case I travel all over  the globe and I make friends in all country I pass by! So facebook for me its a way of communication with my business  partners and my long distances friends! And its also a way to keep in touch with my family. I don’t see them very much. And thanks to facebook I can see my nephews grow up! And don’t miss much of them! So pleaseee don’t close it!</p>

<p>This is just a story made up by pranksters. A 50 Billion dollar enterprise will not just close down so easily.They have just added some investors and there is no way they will close down with all the money pouring in. Today money is everything and Mark Zuckerberg is no saint to turndown the investments. If we take this prank seriously than there are some lessons to be learnt like Erasing all the personal details, photographs from the site.</p>

<p>I don’t really blame him for this decision. Plus it is his company for him to decide to do whatever with. I think this shows that he is human, because he could have just sold it and moved on. Kind of reminds me of Bruce Willis at the end of Surrogates</p>

<p>I don't know whether to be happy or sad.<br/>
It's bad news because we'll lose contact with our friends, old friends, won't be able to know what's going on, latest news, lose the photos which remind us of good moments, etc.<br/>
However, it's good news because it will bring us back to life; phone calls and cards instead of wall posts, more time for REAL social life, brings back photo albums, more time for studying/work !!<br/>
Yes, I want my old life back!</p>

<p>Zuck , in my opinion , i rather agree with u . </p>
<p>the nightmare thats called Facebook , needs to be ended but not now !<br/>
i'de suggest to sell it for Google , Google is ranked 1 on websites if Google buys the Facebook  , both websites will be merged to one and will be a " chat  &amp; search " website , and no other website would ever beat this ! that way u can get ur life u wanted back and dont prevent us from what we like  ! we like facebook and dont want it to be shut down !</p>

<p>Utter CRAP!!! Mark is not so foolish. There’s always an option of selling the business which makes a lot more sense than closing it. I don’t think this is true but IF it is…</p>
<p>There’s other reason(s) besides the one(s) stated. Ya’ll disregard till we really see it shut down.</p>

<p>This makes no sense. None whatsoever. Why? Because, how do you go from making BILLIONS in 2010 to shutting it down months into 2011. I doubt it. Too stressful? There are plenty of people working for it. It's impossible for it to get "too stressful" considering everyone has their own job. To an extent, it being deleted IS a sigh of relief. Why? Children, esp. teenagers won't be GLUED to the computer screen. HOWEVER, facebook is a way to stay in touch with family from another city/state/country/province/etc. It's how I keep in touch, however, I also go on whenever I have plenty of free time. Next thing I know, TIME IS GONE. However, weeklyworldnews, nice rumor. <img alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" src="http://web.archive.org/web/20110109052415im_/http://s1.wp.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif?m=1235145237g"/> ))</p>

<p>Please just like sell facebook or something. My stepdad is in the neuro critical care unit in the hospital with a tennis ball sized tumor in the middle of his brain that could most likely kill him. Facebook is the family's way to keep all other family and friends updated on everything that's going on. My step dad's page currently has 306 followers that are relying on that page to know what's going on with surgery and development. Some ppl need facebook for important things.</p>

<p>I really hope this isn't true becuase my whole family is on FB. From Brazil to Minnesota we stay connected and it has been made possible because of FB. if they shut down it shuts off communication with those we wish to be close to but can't be. My daughter who is 7 would be devistated she could see pictures of her father in Brazil. I play games to help me wind down and comment on all of my friends and families comments. It is keeping families together.</p>

<p>He can’t handle the heat. Get out and give it to some1 who can handle a business like that. Its a big deal. Many have family from other countries where they socialize. But switching to something else is very inconvenient. Its hard to find American sites from other countries. It took 3 months for my family 2 find Facebook.</p>

<p>i'm addicted to facebook. on the forreal level. i have a life outside of facebook but i do not know what i will do without it. this better be fake or i will go on a rampage and find Mark Zuckerburg and hurt him. why can't he simply sell the business to another company and let the facebook world remain happy?</p>

<p>it was a good decision Zuck took, but i wanna know if he thought of how people will feel before doing that? just like most other link, facebook has really help us make friends, and infact good business deals. infact, i got ma sweetheart and wife from facebooking. it really exposed us to the really world of global communications. Let him do as he please, but a better one i believe will erupt. Thanks for breaking our heart.</p>

<p>FACEBOOK CAN'T END! phone numbers changes, home  addresses change, but facebook accounts never do. ONCE facebooks gone, how will we get in contact with high school friends after graduation, friends met on European trips that live in California, or sisters living in New York?? (calling her will cost money)Facebook is a way to communicate HW and projects, inspiring movies to watch in the movie theater or youtube, telling people about how your in a relationship with a person you love, or spreading the awareness of breast cancer and other group effects!<br/>
deleting facebook is as if you found the cure for AIDS, but you decide not to inform the world about your discovery because the population of the world is massive already.</p>

<p>Really?  Why isn't any other business news reporting this?  It is worth 50 billion (according to FinancialTimes.Com). According to Wall Street Journal they are set to increase shareholders to above 500 this year, which means by April of 2012 they would have to disclose financials or go by public.  And this week they are offering 1.5 billion dollars of shares of stock thru Goldman Sachs.</p>

<p>I myself like to keep in contact with people I care about the most so I don’t mind getting on facebook every once in a while</p>

<p>I'm with you Naushad. Sell it to someone who won't get stressed  earning a hefty living. Plenty of people out there in desperate need of an income – BIG INCOME.  Facebook opened the entire world and brought us together. Who is really behind shutting it down I wonder????</p>

<p>Why are you going to close facebook?  That is just going to anger alot of teens around the world.. !! Facebook helps alot of people connect with old friends and family…<br/>
if its stressful im sure everyone can understand that, But dont ruine other peoples enjoyment because of it, just SELL THE SITE!!. Im pretty sure there MAANY out there who would pay big bucks for the site. And you said its not the money that matters… So it matters to piss Millions of people off?</p>

<p>Outdated? Have you tried the Myspace's new design? It sux! My whole family from all over the world are on FB and it's the only way we get to stay close and share our lives. Maybe you need to connect with family to realize that shutting down FB would be devistating to so many people. How can you be so insensitive? If your just looking for fun and games because "it's losing it's touch" go out and get a Real life and stop thrill seeking through social platforms. Nough said.</p>

<p>In a way, for some people, like me, facebook is a good thing when you have family on the other side of the World. I'm in Canada and almost all my family lives in Italy and facebook is our only way of communicating since calling is kind of expensive…closing up facebook is a bad idea. Just sell it if you don't like the stress of it, I do understand how it can be a big thing, it must be stressful so sell it, and people who don't have a life anymore since they're on facebook, it's their problem for being 'stuck' on facebook.</p>

<p>i see that you will make a bad decision .. you can solve your problems instead of close facebook<br/>
1- do not allow any one to talk about any religions<br/>
2- do not allow people to talk about politics<br/>
it is successful web site .. and you only need to improve the your ways with it</p>

<p>I can see the point of parents whos kids are glued to it, but its their responcibility to control that. I love in alberta where as my entire family lives in ontario. Fb is a way for me to stay connected to my family &amp; watch my neices &amp; nephews grow. I think the reasoning behind closing fb is stupid to be honest. I know a tonne of ppl who use fb for same reason I do… Everyone is just gunna turn to myspace. But whatever, do what you do. Someone else will just come up with something simular.. There are already sites that mimic fb. ie my year book.</p>

<p>If this is true, AMEN. I'm not a parent, and I do have a facebook, but honestly, facebook is boring. People, at least a lot of my friends, have stopped using it and have moved on to other social networking sites, kind of like what happened with myspace. I don't think it's that much of a travesty, because there are plenty of other things to do besides stare at a virtually non-changing page.</p>

<p>The company for Facebook just bought Myspace, so obviously they are not gonna just get rid of facebook. This is a fake, if you notice this is the same "news source" such as "UFO SIGHTING!" and "Sasquatch it real!" Even though some of it I wish was true… people really do need a life outside of facebook and everything online, so I hope it gets out some kind of message.</p>

<p>Thats awesome news! This site is bs if you ask me, really people do we need that much online use these days. What happened lets meet in person, ill call you. Online is just for loaners that dont have the confidence to meet or live a real life. Who carea about pictures when your eating or taking a crap. If they have a facebook they shpuld screen and charge people if they like it so much pay for it, then see how important it is to you. On top of it being a site that can expose a persons name location thats a pruvacy issue if someone attempted to track people this site could be dangerouse in the wrong hands. I vote end the social networking!</p>

<p>But we also made new friends through facebook so how you can take it now from us?!,,,let us choose for ourselves!!!…also there are other sites nearly have the same idea as facebook as twitter for example and ppl may go to it so your target to make ppl stop connecting through the internet will fail and they won't jump suddenly in to reality as you might think and maybe they won't connect to reality at all, who knows, so think twice of your decision and stick to your invention and try to improve it to cope more with reality and thanks alot for the facebook it really added to us in many ways and we really appreciate your effort with us but finally its your life and your decision and i liked the idea about selling facebook!.. why not?.. and good luck mark…</p>

<p>I hope facebook isn't shut down. For the ppl who don't have lives and are glued to their pc's or laptops, that's unfortunate. For those that don't have time and hours to be on the phone long distance with ppl, fb is a beautiful thing. Fb has let long lost ppl get and keep in touch with each other. Its very easy and convienent for ppl to be able to send messages to each other. I barely watch the news because everytime you turn the tv on, something's bad going on but I'm friends on fb with alot of stations, and I'm kept very informed.</p>

<p>I agree Marta,It made it possible to find so many friends and family that I had lost touch with,some as far back as 40 yrs.It's has been wonderful to hear all the spiritual and encouraging things that people post and do.It probably is overwhelming,but the money that is generated can afford him to hire the people needed to keep up with growth,as well as helping with employing all these eager young minds that would love the opportunity.He maybe leary of handing too much control of his BABY to others!!</p>

<p>All of the social networking sites popularity gets down after some years. Whether it is something new popping out or people getting board of the same old same old thing. People always wants to experience something new, something so they can live up with. But in the case of facebook, its different. It's gaining popularity every single day. There are various reason for it and people are sticking unto it. Although its coming to an end. it would be great if facebook gives the users the ability to play around with the page so that they have its own look before going to the grave. </p>
<p>I personally wasn't much of facebook users but it has helped me met some old friends, see the old pictures which otherwise was locked up in a box in the closed, look at the updates of friends who otherwise wouldn't blog or email you about it (not because you are not important, but because they just don't fell like updating people through those medium) and so on. </p>
<p>Mark Zuckerberg has played a big role bringing people together but at the end its his decision to shut it down for good. I absolutely agree with him looking at some of my friends life and comments in the article above. But for some people it would be devastating. Theres always a new thing to hold on to, but facebook would be always remembered. </p>
<p>The article also mentions that 'all photos, notes, links, and videos will be permanently erased.'. I hope they delete the database entirely so that nothing is there, not even a 'bit' of any data. </p>
<p>I also hope that Mark would go for something new this time. May be he would join F/LOSS and contribute to the community or may be he would join some proprietary company; but the thing is to look out for what this capable man has to offer in the near future. </p>

<p>Facebook will be the only way I can stay in touch with my highschool friends at college…Sure, I have their numbers, but if I want to keep up with them on what they're doing, I could just look at the web page. I don't always have time to go out of my way and share a 2 hour phone conversation with someone.</p>

<p>You can shut FB down!! I don't too much care abt posting comments and other things in here, but I love my games that I play in FB. If you took the time out and look at your games and how many people plays the games, you will understand. Cafeworld, Cityville, City of wonder and Sorority life is the games that I love the most. And just buy playing these games, I stay in the house more and off the road with the darama that goes on in the real world</p>

<p>Okay by shutting down facebook you are going to be know as a complete idiot! just sell it or something. Facebook keeps many people in contact with far away family, old high school/college friends. yeah it will make people go outside and actually be with their friends, but people cant do that when their friend is half way around the world… and by my honest opinion if facebook was left the way it originally was i dont think this issue would occur. just saying..</p>

<p>I don't understand why he would just "pull the plug" on Facebook.  I too am a Facebook "addict" but I have found so many wonderful groups on here. I have found old friends and family as well. I think there are too many easy venues for Tea Party and Constitutionally minded people on Facebook and he was pressured to "shut them up".  I know that sounds like the rantings of a loon but hey, ya just saying is all.</p>

<p>Ok my name is Alexa Allen i am 14 plz do not axe facebook i meet my lost family on here i keep contact with them on facebook because they live far away plz think of all the people and children that has found there lost family members if this true i will cry. Facebook is my life and PARENTS that agree. You got to do what you wanted when you was a child let us keep it. I have more convertions with my mother and father on facebook then i do in person.  My life resolves around facebook i do my homework and my chores ok. PLz  plz if yo have a heart do not axe facebook. I don't want to lose my famliy memebers and don't use the come back well call them i can't. 1 I don't have long distances and  2 they dont have phone belive it or not. My life will crash and if I lose my family because of  the Manager i'll mad and upset.. OH  p.s. parents that say good maybe I can have a converstion with my child all you have to do is say I want to talk to you. plus we're teens so let us live. I don't belive in God but I will pray that facebook doen't get the axe.</p>

SELL IT!… nt all these crap we’re getting about a shut down… nobody forced him 2 start it in the first place.. if he’s nt a spoiler, he’ll just sell it off , give the money to charity and let us hav some pEACE! that is if he really doznt need the money…. there are other social net sites begging 4 wat he’s throwing away…     why beg him? let him do his worst….</p>

<p>Well I have to say , I'm glad but then I'm not , im a regular teen who spends many hours on Facebook, but it would be tragic for facebook to shut down; which means i wont be able to talk to my friends in other cities/countries. But as for overall, Facebook has become more of a social game site, where people at a young age only get it just to play games and keep track of there score. Also to mention the fact that other sites are getting bigger; Twitter, Tumblr, Formspring.</p>

<p>alright to be honest im 16 years old..just because yuh shut fcaebook down doesnt mean your kids gonna un glues thierself's from the computer they either going to go back to myspace or go to twitter either way teenagers aren't gonna just stop being on the computer because of ONE social network thats getting shut down..and i dont blame him people sewing him over thier own kids hurting them selfs and doing stuid stuff its not his fault that people like to bully..either way kids will still bully its life…your kids just have to have that brain that F*** what anybody say im not taking my life because you dont like me…and people gonna hate him even more if he does because people meet there long lost friends and family members..either way facebook maker whatever your name is your life will still be stressful..</p>

<p>i can live without facebook but it is a little upsetting because although he says people should get out and make "real friends", what  he doesnt realize is this is a way to see photos of "old friends" and family that you may not see otherwise….he should just sell it to someone else.</p>

<p>Facebook helped me reconnect with old friends and relatives that I hadn't talked to for a long time before finding them on facebook. Facebook means even more to me than other people because while I was in foster care, facebook is the only way I could talk to my mother without getting in trouble. so please don't shut it down! If I lose facebook, it will be like losing all of my closest friends all over again.</p>

<p>I think closing Facebook will be a very good decision because as mentioned in the above article "Without Facebook, people will have to go outside and make real friends. That’s always a good thing", and after that young people will return to their normal life in stead of setting for too long hours in front of PCs paging Facebook.</p>

<p>Look Mark Zuckerberg , Facebook is a way to communicate with others. I have made great friendships just by people liking my statuses and sending friend requests. Facebook is a way for me to show the adventures I've had by my pictures, sharing the answers I get and comparing them with others when I take a quiz. Facebook has a BIG IMPACT on my life and I would HATE to see it go. You've done alot to help people out with Facebook. Your layout, fan pages, groups, and "What's on your mind?" box make Facebook x1O times better then Myspace. If you stop Facebook, we will only have Twiter. There's a Twitter Jail, not a Facebook jail. I just recently moved and I enjoy talking to people that don't have cellphones by using Facebook. If I leave my homewrok somewhere or just need a friend's help. I always go to Facebook. All I'm asking is, PLEASE do not make some stupid decision to shut it DOWN. If it's that stressful, sell it to someone! It'll be more stressful when people go on with having with-drawal symptems because they can't use Facebook. Thank you. <img alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" src="http://web.archive.org/web/20110109052415im_/http://s2.wp.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif?m=1235145237g"/> </p>

<p>facebook is one of the most popular friend finder web in the world. i dont know if this thing is possible because many peoples life especially teenagers life depends from facebook. for me is better if facebook get closed because i was a nice pupil before i had facebook account now im bad pupil. so for me facebook should get closed</p>

<p>you are all stupid. obviously fake. you are all proof that human beings are sheep. obvious practical joke to get you to delete your FB account, for the lulz. why would deleting your pictrues, accounts, etc. help if they're just going to get deleted on march 15th as the article states?</p>

<p>thats just crap, sell it to someone and stop being so stupid! if you cannot handle the stress, sell it to someone who can and harden the f**k up already. you are going to dissapoint millions of people worldwide by shutting it down.

<p>I think this is fake b/c if you google it you can't find any information about it except for this article….and why would he not sell it if he can't handle it?? It makes no sense..I mean considering the # of users it has…who would close down a website this popular…I don't believe it…Also I think that if he was really going to close it he would put a message to users on the actual site explaining his plan. This is bull.</p>

<p>He has a billion dollar company and your going to shut it down because your stressed out?…That is why you hire people to work for you. I refuse to believe that's the real reason…The government or "!whoever!" is making you shut it down should have came up with a better excuse dude…Stuff like this doesn't make me think the world coming to a end but that somebody high up is pulling some major strings with the goal of disorient the public</p>

<p>If  you really can't manage it and the things become  out of  your hands .. … shut it down … coz  there will be disasters if  this site couldn't be managed … </p>
<p>for those whose lifes depend on facebook .. your life is more than that .. more than being based on this site .. plzz appreciate the value of your life and your time and don't make it depend on one little thing .. live your life practically and don't limit it behind computer screens .. </p>
<p>about communications there's thousand ways to communicate with others …. </p>
<p>I think it's better to shut it down coz  facebook disadvantages are more than the advantages ..<br/>

<p>Exactly how I feel…if you're spending every hour of the day on FB then maybe you need 2 find something else to do with your time, but like you said it has been a helpful tool in finding family &amp; friends &amp; I've actually met some wonderful &amp; positive people on there.</p>

<p>okay i understand why teens parents might be upset but learn control your kids.  i use facebook to keep in touch and updated on friends and family members who live far away other states and whatsoever.  it takes less time and money for them to post a picture or status as to whats going on that to send them through the mail to everyone and have to  15 minutes on facebook verses hours of calling people and the sending through cell phones not everyone has the updated technology i thinkl maybe if you cant handle it alone you should hiree more people and make it a little more difficult for teens to spend hours or even join.</p>

<p>Dont shut it down off of how much drama happens, people bring drama and its not caused because of the website. its caused because girls and boys both like drama ! most of it is school drama and people dont no what to do when there bored ! it doesnt make sence to shut down a good website like this, maybe you should only let a certian age of people go on facebook so the drama level will drop but dont shut it down</p>

<p>This is the stupidest thing i have ever heard. Like really this is how i find out what i have for homework if i forget to write something down . This is where i find colleges to audition into for dance. This is where i find my family or friends because sometime i cannot contact them . Facebook has gotten me further in life and taught me alot of lessons . I mean i know everyone can live without facebook but facebook helps alot of people out . Just think you would lose everything if you gave up on Facebook . Yeaa some people are addicted to it but you know what its not your problem and thats what theyre doing with their time its not your life at all . You Should N O T shut facebook down i think Personaly its a Bad idea . . . Cause people find their jobs on here as well as where to get educated . . . Also if people have lost contact of family this is where they find them cause sometimes people arent listed in phonebooks or other ways to be found. Many Buisnesses are found on here and this is where they get all their costumers. If they shut Facebook down it will be a M I S R E B I L E out come there will be no up to it . Im just saying so i hope that this gets shown to someone and they take it into concideration. bye &lt;3</p>

<p>but you can't delete Facebook. a lot of people are saying this is a joke and i seriously hope it is. my cousins live in chicago, they're 2 and 4, and their mom doesn't have other websites, so ill never get to be in contact with them. it's not fair to the people who got facebooks. you shouldn't have started it if you're not gonna close it. you do realize we still go outside with our real friends and have a Facebook, right? why don't you just sell Facebook to google or something instead of deleting it? like really its not that hard.</p>

<p>I am 45 and a mother of six. Four of my children are in college all over the country. FB has been the best way for all of us to stay in touch with one another with all the conflicts in schedules. We leave each other posts or inbox a message. I have found friends that I haven't talked to in years. My husband has done the same. How could they just drop the site? Sucks a big one, that's for sure!!!!!</p>

<p>Yes I do agree with a lot of other people. If it seems to be to much for the owner, then maybe he should just sell it instead of just shutting it down. If he sale it he can be done with it and make money all at the same time. If it was me that's what I would do.</p>

<p>yea thats wat everyone wants having facebook sold to a 3rd party where so many people plus more people will have and solicite all our information…facebook is a disgrace when u stop and think about it…its a way of living life not free-bein on facebook is so stupid but everyone including me use it..its stupid because it ruins peoples lives,people talk shit bout people upsetting them and are mean, child molesters,people addicted to facebook,them being secret and not telling neone wat they really do with our info..i look at it how it is..its called face book…a website like a book that gives authorities the opportunity to search for people or gain information about one person and find out about all their friends and associates,a way for authorities to view ur picture,view ur information then go to google or spokeo if u havnt erased that and then with the info they stole from ur fb page they type into google n  find out exactly where u live..now ur not safe from neone..before it was suimtin like "oh i know him but i have no idea where hes from,let me check facebook and google maps n spokeo n find out his name address number n picture of house where u work n how much ur house was worth and who u live with and all ur pictures!!!!</p>

<p>You're fucking stupid if you believe this. Honestly, this is probably the most obvious troll on the internet.<br/>
If you think Mark Zuckerberg doesn't have a board of fucking computer whizzes taking care of the site then you need to go kill yourself. He created it and once it got big, it's no longer his problem. He just rakes in the fucking cash like the soulless ginger he is while a team of Asians keeps the site up and running.</p>

OMG i frekinqq hate that FAcebook will be shutting down. You have way too many fans out there &amp;&amp; yhour gonna give up. I LOVE FACEBOOK. Yhou should at least let someone else take over. UGHH MAd as ever. We should have a vote.</p>

<p>i think this is an advertisement of Facebook  to increase his income … some of company like to make like this lie only to gain money and it wouldn't close … or i think it is only advertisement to twitter</p>

<p>Facebook has helped me in many ways to keep in contact with mission people and all.  However I agree, it's like a bus you miss one and catch the next.  Another network will have all FB users info to ask if they want to go with them and the young manager life will never be the same.  FB changed his life by fluke and it will not be the same he just did not know what he had. Also, he doesn't even care how much people like this great product, it was in the plan already and it would be sad to see it go.  But he young and want to be in control because he started it but he really doesn't own it, the people do, we can start our own facebook or site and eliminate all cursing on it as a requirement.  The Christians can get together and get a site we network with.  something better is coming in Jesus name..thank you Jesus.  Devil is over the airways but Jesus owns it all not the kid that started it..amen.</p>

<p>i really hope that this is not true, this is the only way i keep in contact with my friends all over in england, or in a different time zone here in the united states….it would be a shame for such a great social network to go away…yes i think it needs some changes, ie taking down all those ridiculous like pages and what not…but its a great way to communicate with family and friends…take it back to the basic write messages/write on walls/chat….</p>

<p>I think you should definitely sell Facebook, simply because it has opened up many networking opportunities for people of all ages. I ♥ Facebook! What am I going to do?!</p>

and that particular quote  </p>

<p>Do ALL of you believe EVERYTHING you read in Internet tabloids?  This isn't a real website. It's a mock news website. If you want REAL information, you go to Yahoo News or tune in on your radio or television. Facebook isn't shutting down. If it were, there would be a bigger uproar and an immediate connection to the news channels. Don't you think news like this would be more widespread? You people need to use your brains.</p>

<p>im a 15 year old teenage boy. in my opinion hes being kind of selfish. facebook has united so many people i dont like myspace is too complicated.  twitter is possibly the stupidest thing ive herd so im not using it. I get a lot of information through facebook and people have started soo many petitions and ideas spread over it. To see it go is like loosing a friend.  With AIM instant messenger all i talked to were people i knew and physco perverts who found my stuff. this is crap. If he finds it stressful let someone else take over the business im sure plenty of people would like to run a bug a** company like that. Im not on facebook 10 hours a day thats stupid. i have a life. but it allows life outside of normality to occur and it makes things so efficent and simple. Well i guess i might start e-mailing people like a 50 year old -__- (no offense).  Mark Z. i have to say im dissapointed in you. You've overcome so much stuff and i mean a movie was even made out of facebook and now your just shutting it down. wow…well i hope your happy. i Know im not.</p>

MORE SENSE THERE!  Please our families are in different countries and how could we all find them without facebook please!</p>

<p>Too many businesses depend on the website </p>
<p>its a major source of marketing </p>
<p>and univerisities and companies are using it as a tool to check their students/employees </p>
<p>three good reasons why facebook is going absolutely NOWHERE. </p>

<p>i think its a very good idea now the children of todays world and start back communicating with their familys on a one on one basis. This so called facebook has ruined alot of relationships and hurt alot of people and there are no family values anymore . Bring it back</p>

Since I watch that movie social netwrk I realize that brilliant minds like those just don’t know how to give up billions just like dat in a day. Lololol. But seriously people. Cut the crap nothing no go so and nothing will ever go so    sue me if them cut it off. Am willing to bet 7billion on that. Anybody care to bet</p>

<p>should  have thought about it when  you started it  that it was  going to be big. so what was the point, and  btw i do have a life outside  fb….. i  actually seen an interview on  tv the other night how much  have you made off face book?????……..i think it was in the billions…instead of  closing it, sell it  to someone who actually cared about the site.. which obviously  you never  did ..</p>

<p>Facebook Rules The World. Of course nobody would care if MySpace was deleted, cause hey, Who the hell gets on there anymore. But I personally believe he should sell the site, rather than deleting it. What would that prove if he deletes it over selling it? Nothing.</p>

<p>hi..the creator might have a good reason to close facebook because of his own issues etc. but i think he should just sell facebook to someone else so that these millions of people including me can keep in touch and keep reuniting with their old friends and distant family members. why let someone else restart a new website thats gonna end up exactly like FB and steal the creators money when he could just sell it to someone and do something with the money or keep it and move on with his life.. why end up like myspace did..

If you look on here The official blog there's nothing about it shutting down.. in fact they plan to update the site some more. If they're shutting it down I imagine they'd give users more notice than a news story….. Especially when they're supposedly deleting the lot.<br/>
I think it could be true.. but maybe not.. If you read the story the interview with Mark Zuckerberg was over the phone.. Maybe a hoax?</p>

<p>I think you are making a big mistake. FB has helped so many people reunite with family and friends that they have not seen for many years including me. Yes, it has caused a lot of people to become addicted but people have to manage their own lives to the best of their abiliy. FB has been away for many people to come together on all kindsof occassions and it has been great. This will take away the life line for many people because MySpace and Twitter is just not as friendly user and we FB users would really love for it to stick around. I been moved from the state that I graduated from years and years ago and if it was not for FB I would not have known about my class reunion. FB is worth saving just get some silent partners or someone to help manage the site.</p>

<p>if he cant handle the stree of running the site turn it over to someone else who can run the site. zuckerburg has already become very rich from all of this. it didnt help that they made that movie about the whole thing either. if the guy isnt up to the challenge of running the company why did he even make the website in the first place. many people also use facebook as a way to communicate with people far away that they dont have the liberty of seeing every single time they wanna talk to them. people even use this site for work, yes people are addicted to and spend to much time on it and put there hard earned money into  buying stuff on the games.  but  it has helped alot of people stay connected with people.</p>

<p>All I can say is that. I have found Friends from my childhood, family I have not talked to in years, NEW friends, Support groups. I am unable to get out of the house much. I know there are other sites. I will make sure to keep in touch with those I am close to…Maybe someone will step up and buy it and take it over.</p>

<p>I hope it's true. But at the same time, i've learnt alot in Fb, made new friends, etc. And it's the only way i can contact my relatives on FB, like ex. if they live in another country.. We never talk so what's the point? And i've realised that i've spent lots of time on this site, when i should do more important things. I never sleep and I'm behind in school, thanks to Fb.<br/>
It will be sad, but at the same time, good.<br/>
Mostly sad.. or both.</p>

<p>thats not fair man<br/>
facebook help people catch up with people they have lost in contact over the years<br/>
to be honest all that needs sortin is security…<br/>
just keep facebook<br/>
or sell it to someone who can run it<br/>
i do have a life but its nice that after a long day i can comne home n talk to my friends on there before i go to bed<br/>
and no u cant just talk to them over the phone because there are to many people<br/>
facebook is the most easiest social networking site avalible at this point in time and the most popular.<br/>
if u stop updating all the time then it wouldnt be so hard on you to be fair because it does make it harder for us to work it out.<br/>
if u keep changin it then obviously there are going to be things going wrong and cause more stress to the company.<br/>
i dont understand why you wish to stop facebook if it is so popular.<br/>
you should be glad that the site has so many people interested. thats what makes a good site.</p>

<p>its not like people use F.B just for socializing thru computer it also helps everyone when you dont have a communication with your friends or if you want to update someone with the current news like projects at universities that had been forgotten its true that most of F.B users see's it as just a socializing web page but over all F.B had been very useful for its reliability on communication and functions so why remove it when it had become a very useful tool for everyone ? surely there are lots of people who got addicted into using it that's why some think that its just hindrance to their life but it really did get good grades for communication and socializing.</p>

<p>This is crazy! You cant take fb out of business… Fb is more then just a a way to make new friends.. You hear the next big news that happened or is happening, advertising, a way to talk to my family quickly that live thousands of miles away from me. You also learn new things that just arent about drama. I dont like hearing this at all!</p>

<p>He can't do that because if he does chose to delete it,he would have to give everyone's money back to had joined facebook because we made our profile to communicate to people we can't really talk to in person, or phone and talk to others we can't communicate with people from other countries,what if those people don't have phones,example like me.If he were to delete it, we were just wasting our whole time on here for nothing.Getting him rich with OUR money for nothing.Parents are so not relieved because my parents get on and their piste about this and they have met so many of their old friends since they've been little from facebook.<br/>
Zackerberg if you want your life back give facebook to someone else that can handle it.<br/>
closing facebook down would be a big mistake.<br/>

<p>.it doesn't seem he cares that much abt what he's going to do..or in other meaning he wants to see how big his fb is around the world…so this desicion in my opinion abt 2 points….either he wants to see  reactions for his success..or he wants to show his big head from the world window…..but sutting down is kinda far matter…cause think abt it….even Microsoft couldnt be a partner with him…he rejected a lotttt of tempting offers,,,,even milliars of dollars….how could he just sacrifice w that?!….he doesn't want any manager to do it after him?…..noway…you compare .."milliars $ – im the only manager for fb ! " no comparison at all<br/>
think if u were him..<br/>
would u sacrifice w one of the most successful companies around the world?<br/>
would you erase your name even if ppl talked abt u for awhile ?<br/>
if u want to get a life &amp; put all this responsibility away..u can let it for who cares…<br/>
but to act like itsn't a big deal .. blahhh</p>

<p>i think that you should at least sell it to someone else like others have said don't just shut it down. Alot of ppl have been able to connect with family and friends and i am one of many.

<p>Wow this guy sounds like a freaking baby, for real it's ruined his life? He's just mad about that movie. Grow up dude! All my friends on facebook were already my friends before facebook. How judgemental to say people will go outside now and make real friends, whatever this guy knows everything I guess. It's a good way to stay in touch with old friends or family who live far away. This is overdramatic and ridiculous.</p>

<p>its irresponsible what about all the people who is working in facebook the employees what about them if he doesnt want FB then freakin sell it and if you really dont care about the money just sell it in a really cheap price so other companies will buy it fast and they can manage it why he wants to shut it down or because he got the money he need for his life and he just thought for fun i will close it i dont need it anymore.

<p>Does anyone REALLY believe this story? Have you never read Weekly World News tabloids off the news-stands? These hare the same creative writers who came up with Bat Boy &amp; the stories of the alien endorsing various Presidential candidates. </p>
<p>I'm just glad to find out that WWN still exists, if only online. They're very creative &amp; entertaining! It's like April Fool's Day every day. Thanks, WWN, for all the smiles you've given us!</p>

<p>yes. facebook has i think gotten way to out of control, but alot of people use it for school and communicating with family outside of the country as well as friends who they are not able to see If facebook were to really shut down i would not be able to talk with my friends as much, because for us it costs alot of money to talk with them on the phone. i mean thats the whole reason why i got facebook how many ever years ago.</p>

<p>So many people LOVE facebook.There lives wont be the same without it! REALLY THINK about what you're doing before you do it. We have a facebook because we talk to people from a different state that u know and they dont have a phone or ANYTHING besides facebook. soo many people will be soo sad. I know i will. this is gonna mess mine and my friends life up. think about what you are doing</p>

<p>An irrational decision if you ask me. If he doesn’t want to get involved with Facebook any more, he doesn’t have to close it. He can just remove himself from Fb and someone else can own it, rather than throw away a multi-billion dollar website and ruin the personal lives of millions. He’s thinking about himself instead of the millions of people who use Facebook.</p>

<p>Instead of closing the site , since it's making your life a living hell basically as u say . . why not hand it over to someone else . . . i think he's being very self-centered by only thinking of himself. true fb has multi of drama but this is really a wonderful site that i dont think should ever be closed down. people keep in touch with their family , find long lost friends plus MANY more . . i honestly think this is a dumb idea</p>

How about you not be an antisocial teenager, and get out a little bit.  Go for a walk, make a new friend.<br/>

<p>Absolute rubbish. Facebook is a multi-billion dollar corporation with one of the world's largest advertising networks, if it became "too stressful", you wouldn't close the entire company (and dismiss all of the Facebook staff), you would sell the company and step down as managing director. Stopping the service completely is just not going to happen. </p>
<p>This is just an attempt to make a viral article and get people talking about it, it will never happen, because Facebook is more than a social networking tool, it is a platform for other businesses and advertisement opportunities, a lot of the site other organisations rely on. </p>
<p>This site should be shut down.</p>

<p>Yeah there are people that have become obsessed with facebook, especially with young adults; however, it has created a way for people to conect with those they do not see on a daily basis anymore or have lost touch with them. It's not that they are lazy and won't be forcing to see themface to face, but it's because they are unable to because of distance and other reasons.  Speaking as a teenager, I'm not allowed to be hanging out with my friends a lot outside of school because of her fear of someting happening, so I like being able to use the site to still talk to them since I don't have a phone.<br/>
Simply hand over the company to another group or to someone you trust.  The site has helped several businesses and even helped CNN. You'd be suprised how many people would help make this task seem less stressful.</p>

<p>i feel like he doesnt need to shut facebook down many people use it to find people they havent seen in along time and gives them the chance to reconnect with them. if it was beginning to get so stressful he should have sold it to someone.</p>

<p>Why facebook shutdown?  I’m deaf and it is really worth for me to have FB and feel that “technically” see my far away relatives and friends..  Found some lost relatives and friends..  Keep in touch with them..  Now u said no more FB that mean I go back in old dark time!  Please don’t close FB..</p>

<p>Its called satire, meaning its not true but there is a deeper meaning to it. These people that wrote it want to show that people shouldn’t be wasting their time on facebook so much. Even if Mark truly wanted to have his life back, he would just retire and leave it to other people while he still would get imense amount of cash. Can’t believe that so many people were fooled. Just look at the site! Its full of satire and jokes.</p>

<p>what an idiot<br/>
if he was smart he would sell it to a company<br/>
for me i use facebook and i get on once a day<br/>
i get on to check how everybody is doing then i go outside </p>
<p>he says that this will give people better lives?<br/>
i am currently using facebook also to find friends i lost contact with </p>
<p>he says that he wants his old life back?<br/>
it wont come back once you become a celebrity there's no turning back<br/>
also the millions of companies and people that need facebook will<br/>
hold a grudge against him including me </p>
<p>i say he should sell it not delete it, this is an outrage<br/>
as i said before what an idiot<br/>

<p>it's not a big deal, am sure that in a month or so a new website will replace facebook and they'll call Handbook or something it's not the end of the world you know!!</p>

<p>i completely understand to his decision.. i respect it. but however i love this site coz it makes me finding many best friends n families from many regions n countries too. though i don't add too much people as my friends but i think i've made a well relation ship with them. something which is impossible for me who's living in a far way of d world.. i think FB is good as long as we know how to manage ourselves. thank u FB..</p>

<p>Please dont delete!! Facebook has helped me find friends and family i never get to see. I love how you have pages you can like on it. Yes, you may have a lot of stress but do you know how many people look up to you from making facebook. It is free (alot of people like that). Many people have tons of pictures on facebook and if you earse them your earasing a memorie. Sure they can save them on their computer. But that is alot of work. So many people will be dissapointed in you!!!<br/>
Please DO NOT DELETE THE MOST AMAZING WEBSITE EVER!!&lt;333</p>

This cannot be be. Seriously, if you can't handle the stress, sell the company, let it live on or at least get people to run it, there are many other brilliant minds out there.<br/>
Facebook is so much more than it was, it should not be murdered. If they shut it down, this would be a crime, murder one</p>

<p>Its not true…Goldman Sachs just invensted enough money to put the value of the site at $50 Billion. There is no way this is true.  Regardless of what Mark Zuckerbergs life used to be like, with the site still being a private entity and it being worth more than Startbucks and most other huge companies, he's not reverting back to a life of aspiring to be where he already is. And besides, with all the irony in the world crammed into it,  "Weekly World News -The World's Only Reliable News" does not exactly come off as all that "reliable". You people need to calm down.</p>

<p>Ok there will be strokes, heart attacks, suicides all because you want to close the one site that means so much to so many people. How could you?!!  This is our lives, our livelihood.  Do you know how angry this makes me???  We have invested so much in this site and gotten so attached, shared everything here and now you wanna take it away from us?? How selfish!!!  If you don't want your money how about you share it among those of us you are now about to inconvenience you prick.  I'm sorry but this is just alot to take in like the death of a loved one and still I'm trying not to believe it!!  Smmttttt!</p>

<p>All you people who are saying that it’s good it is shutting down: SHUT UP! You know how many people have found there old friends that they haven’t talk to I awhile?

<p>Pleeeaaase don't cancel facebook! It is the ONLY way I can stay in contact with my friends in other states! Im not allowed to have a myspace so I don't have the option to go to another social network! Please just sell facebook instead, if you really must remove it from your life. I don't allow facebook to rule my life like some people do, but I NEED it in order to stay in contact with my close friends and family! Deleting facebook is like giving someone an excellent gift, then taking it back or destroying it in their face!</p>

<p>For the life of me I never understood why he did not sell it to someone who could man it,if thatq is legit. If you don't want it sell it and let someone else have your headache. But if you don't someone else will build a better mouse trap</p>

<p>I hope not…just sell it off or back to the people (creators) who started it in the 1st place.  I don't believe he stole anything from the brothers…if he didn't know what he was doing FB would've shut down a long time ago. Sell it just sell it soon before the deadline!!!! – Good luck!</p>

<p>I think that it is a marketing strategy. They expect that milions of users comlplain about the end of the page, than start offering money to continue on line, etc. Or some bilionare user will buy the Facebook and the legend went on. I sugest that we, Facebook users, DELETE OUR PROFILES NOW! Lets not wait until March 15th! What's this? Sounds like a death sentence! Ridiculous!  I wouldn't let those people to use me to get lots of money. No way. Faby – Brazil</p>

<p>I think Facebook should get shut down. Reading these comments made me realize how many people don't know how to spell thats a sad case!! Makes you guys look dumb ass fuck! When it gets shut down I suggest all you dumb people to get a book and go do something with your lives. Life isn't all about Facebook = Lamebook !!</p>

<p>If you think this article is real at all, then you have absolutely no sense of humor. It's all a joke and once you realize that and read it over, it's pretty funny. For example, "but that he does not think people will be upset." Of course people will be upset. Why would he just shut it down? Why not resell it? hahaaha</p>

<p>hey because i don't know how to put my oinion on here could you please explain to whoever it is closing facebook that teens literally need facebook. it's not because it's cool or anything but facebook has helped save lives.  my friends and some of their friends s i'm sure have announced that they were going to kill themselves and when facebook is the only thing left to turn to friends all help to make them understand why they're so much better than they think they are. i'm not a sensitive person but earlier when i heard that facebook was being cancled i cried and i'm sure my friends did too and i need my friends as they need me. please i'm not saying this because i love facebook. and all 346 of my friendds ageee with thes. :'(  nobody wants to lose their friends. it's the only thing we have left to talk to anyne. and it's not that we can get new friends because we don't trust anyone but our friends.</p>

<p>I have too many friends from my old school in a diffrent state .. And family in other countries! Facebook is the only way I can contact them and stay in touch. I personally think he is being a bit selfish, there are a ton of people who use facebook to contact loved ones. When my father was in afghanistan I could only talk to him through fb. He should just sell it to someone who wouldn’t mind running it for a while. He might even regret ending it. People are going to be mad.. So remember it was your decision. Your fault.</p>

<p>Please dont shut facebook down. For once in my life i really have felt that i could open up to people about my hobbies. facebook helped me make friends from other countries and be able to share our love that we have for the same hobby. Please think about it carefully before you actually shut it down.

<p>what a selfish jerk he is for only thinking about himself. I mean your life is stressful, thats sad and all but why should your problem ripple and effect everyone in the world, facebook user or not. The smart thing to do is find someone to take his job so he can still get  paid. And the comment he made about no one getting upset? Honestly? Your supposed to be an intelligent man from Harvard who has become a billionaire. This decision is anything but smart. Now everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but im sure that more people want facebook then those who do not. Besides. some people actually use facebook for legitimate reasons. I've heard of stories where couples that broke up or separated for whatever reason such as moving away, reconnect and find a way to see each other again. Parents can find long lost sons or daughters that were separated from them after a natural disaster or an issue like that. Although some use facebook for unnecessary reasons, it makes them happy and helps them connect with who they want and if thats what they like to do then so be it. It is a free country and facebook is no exception to the fact that no one should be judged for what they use it for. So, i think Mark Zuckerberg should keep facebook on the internet for all to enjoy in their own way. Otherwise i hope someway somehow he reads this and thinks hard about what he's doing. I hope he thinks about why a young teen like myself would write something like this if facebook wasn't a part of mine and millions of others daily lives. I  hope he makes the right decision, the decision to keep facebook.</p>

<p>why would he want to shut down facebook. There are to many people out there that have found old friends and family on facebook. I know that I did. What are we going to do go back to myspace I still have myspace account but I dont get on it like I use to. I just think that Mark Zuckerberg needs to think about it and what it will being to the people on facebook!!! you can vist my at <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20110109052415/http://www.facebook.com/jessica.buell" rel="nofollow">http://www.facebook.com/jessica.buell</a> or email seach&gt;jessicakathleen@msn.com!!!</p>

<p>This is not true at all. You can tell from reading this, Zuckerberg would not make those kind of comments and be so rude as to telling people to get out of their homes and make real friends. Even if Zuckerberg did want to leave, why not leave it too someone else? On March 15th everyone will still be their narcissistic self and the world will go on.</p>

<p>I really hope facebook doesn’t end. Although a lot of parents think When it ends it will be better for their kids I STRONGLY disagree. Facebook is actually a opportunity for all age groups to interact and to keep intouch with their long lost friend/family. Facebook has help me find family I never knew existed and friends I haven’t seen in years. If managing such a popular social site , I would consider selling it to someone who could manage. Rather then just shutting it down. This social site was a brilliant idea and I believe that it has so much potential. I really hope that they can reconsider about closing it down. For a example facebook helps so many people stay in contact with each other. Our troops that are out fighting or over seas and can’t see their kids,wives/husbands, and family use facebook as a alternative to do so. So PLEASE think of what you are doing because it does matter to use and we do care. Overall , I really think you should keep facebook up and running their are so many people that depend on websites like this to actually interact with people.</p>

<p>A lot of us that use FB are army wives and families that have loved ones deployed over seas. We don’t get phone calls from our Soldiers all the time and most of the time all we get is a ten minute chat here on FB. We go without weeks not hearing from our Soldiers not knowing If they are alive or dead!! So just because this guy wants his old life back , let someone else take over !!! Let’s see the guy who created FB go fight in this war !!</p>

<p>ok what all you people that are for facebook closing are missing is the fact that even if facebook does shut down (which i dont think it will) then people will go right back to myspace. so you cant really say that closing it would make people go outside or have a "better life" because most would go back to myspace or find anther social networking website.  </p>
<p>ps. i have a facebook and im not always on it. i do have a life thank you very much. but facebook keeps me in touch with friends i never get to see because they live to far away.</p>

<p>I think he should just sell Facebook,then he gets his life back plus sum money for his efforts, the people who criticized him from a financial point of view can buy it and make the money and we still get Facebook,we all are happy then, I think its kinda selfish that he won’t sell or pass it on, he created something amazing y destroy it when it can live on.</p>

<p>What this is crazy! Im a teen myself and I think you should just sell it to someone. Its one of the ways I keep in contact with not only old friends, but family that live far away also. You know not everyone have cell phones…. yea there are fake people, distractions,ect. but this is not going to keep people from acting the way they do and it wont get people off the computer. They might just go back to myspace or twitter, but when you think about it those sites even worse. &gt;____&lt;</p>

<p>this is extremely dissapointing. My husband is in the military so we’re always on the move and facebook is the best way for our families to see our newborn son. It was the best way for me to feel close to them.  If the website is too stressful to manage…then he should sell it!</p>

<p>Hey, i can understand, im a teen and yeah i use facebook to keep incontact with my family but i dont HAVE to have it.<br/>
 There are friends i do have on there that i see very rarely and now live in other states, its how i keep in contact with them, my events are important on there, but we can ALL find other ways.<br/>
 It does make me sad to hear about it ending. My mom is against myspace . She ONLY trusts facebook so I wouldnt be able to be on ANY social networks and that, to be honest, sucks big time.<br/>
 Mr. Zuckerburg thinks he is making the right choice, but, I am sure he could have found someone to replace him with the greatest ease.<br/>
 Myspace is very easy to get stalked on. My cousin was and she was upset greatly by it.<br/>
Upon that if facebook is ending i say myspace should be ended too since the hacking and stalking rates on there are EXCESSIVELY higher than facebook.<br/>
 One can only hope tehre is a change in it and maybe a parental setting can be added to make a teen only spend so much time on there. I only spend 3-5 hours a week on there and thats because its always on incase someone Without a phone can talk to me.<br/>
 I believe it is a bittersweet situation when it now comes to teh closing of facebook.</p>

<p>Please don't shut down facebook, its my only way to connect with people that I do not see. How am I going to keep up with my college friends? How am I going to get important memos? Mark Zuckerberg if you can't handle it, get someone else to run it. Your ruining how children can find there long lost relatives and ways facebook has helped people in court.</p>

<p>I AM VERY UPSET THAT FACEBOOK IS ABOUT TO COME TO AN END! YES PEOPLE ARE USING FACEBOOK THE WRONG WAY- BUT SOME OF US USE FACEBOOK TO STAY CONNECTED WITH FRIENDS AND FAMILY. I HAVE BEEN ON FACEBOOK SINCE 2004 AND HAVE SEEN IT CHANGE. I GUESS MYSPACE WILL BE BACK ON THE CHARTS AND SOMEONE WILL MAKE A NEW SITE. Mark Zuckerberg WILL BE THE ONE WHO SEE'S THE LOST IN HIS COMPANY- STRESSFULL???? GROW UP! ITS A BUSINESS.</p>

<p>he could just put another person in charge of the site and go on to a normal life he doesn't have to shut down the whole site it has so much meaning it has spread word for important things and overall is easy to connect to other people he shouldn't shut it down now while it's huge and important but instead wait for it to get old then shut it down this is stupid</p>

<p>Well if that's what you think, then who am I to try and tell you otherwise. But i will say this: The breath that you draw each day you do not take by your self, and because God (who has never done anything for U) Love YOU so much he sent His ONLY son to die for our sins. God is real and whether or not u believe u will meet him face to face, I only hope that when you do, you have already accepted Jesus Christ as your savior and lord.</p>

<p>There is  no way they can shut the site down. All they are doing is making a scam to say there shutting down which they are not, Don't believe everything you read. This site right here weekly worldnews is a joke. Nothing they say has prof or reliable facts, this site is having to make lies to make there website stronger.</p>

<p>Instead of smashing the whole project why not just turn the company over…peoples careers and lives are involved with this social site besides the nefarious actions that can be visually portrayed.  If this is supposed to be a smart decision, it's debatable.  Think about it, take a deal plus a share, you get to keep your life and the people who gained a life from your work get to keep theirs.  RE-think this decision before you cause pandemonium.</p>

<p>Are they crazy thinking people won't be affected. Many people can not get around and Face Book is their life. Are they really going to cut the life line for so many? Could anyone be that cruel after we have made them megga bucks. That sounds like biting the hand that has fed you and you know what that means. Putting the biter down humanely, but I wouldn't be so humane to such a person. How cruel can this person be, thinking he won't affect lives that it won't matter that much? I would personally hang him by the balls till they dropped off. It wouldn't matter to much now would it?</p>

<p>stop bein such a pussy.. Life existed before facebook. There are other methods of socializing i.e. phone, othe websites, face-to-face, etc. Facebook is merely a distraction and builds a false connection. IF one is that dependent on facebook, so much to the point that it brings tears, that person has a problem. And facebook doesnt save lives. If one wanted to kill themselves, they'd do it. Fear of death and the value of life prevents humans fom doing such thing</p>

<p>well my opinion about it is facebook has united new friends and old friends 2 gether.  i know there will b a lot of people who will miss it  because fb was a site where some could only communicate with friends and family. i'm glad i got 2 experience fb. i'm gonna miss the drama, the humor, and most of all the people that i got 2 get 2 conversate with AND DIDN'T EVEN KNOW THEM! thank u mark zuckerberg 4 bringing facebook 2 life. and good luck 2 u on ur future.</p>

<p>I also hope it's true!!!! imagine if you used all the time you've spent for facebook ex. 3-5 hours for something more productive like exercising etc. things like these will be more beneficial to all of the facebook users. Despite this, there are still other social networks. Thank you Lord.</p>

<p>Curious to where the date March 15th comes from? Zuckerberg owns facebook…why not just hit the kill switch if it is really what he wants to do???? Or is there something else that is between the lines? What about the investors in the games? Mmmmmm does all this open up to more lawsuits for him????</p>

<p>y wuld u shut it down for if u know there is soo many people on nd that family members are now recently getting in contact with eachother ? Some people dnt have cell phones and the only way they get into contact is through facebook …. People would be highley upset and wuld be furious if this were to happen… We all have friends that we dnt tlk to but only through fb… Dnt shut it down it will be a mistake… If it gets out of hand try to handle it another way other than having to shut it down… Its not the right thing to do in the new year nd will never be the right thing to do in any year</p>

<p>Now this has its pros and cons !People can communicate in another way but then again it can start problems !Maybe he should get partners or something to help him if he cant handle it .Or maybe he shouldnt have created it and gotten people hooked if he was gonna just take it all away !</p>

<p>Fail at life because facebook dies out?   You would only fail if you choose to.  Facebook has nothing to do with "causing new addictions".  There are plenty out there who have or do not have facebook and are "addicted to drugs, sex, and who knows".</p>

<p>PLEASE DON'T SHUT FACEBOOK DOWN. IT IS A WAY OF COMMUNICATION BETWEEN FRIENDS AND FAMILY. IT ALSO GETS GODS WORD OUT TOO. IF ANYTHING YOU COULD ALWAYS LET SOMEONE THAT WE CAN TRUST TO TAKE OVER FOR YOU. YOU PROBABLY DO GET TRED O MANAGING FACEBOOK. THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT DEPEND ON FACEBOOK TO FIND OUT HOW PEOPLE ARE DOING. IT IS LIKE TEXTING. IF YOU DECIDE TO GIVE IT TO SOMEONE ELSE OR REALLY SHUT IT DOWN, PLEASE LET US KNOW SO THAT WE CAN CLOSE OUR ACCOUNT OUT BEFORE THE DATE OF MARCH 15TH.</p>

<p>There is always myspace… Technology and online interaction will not stop because facebook is shutting down. People should not become upset just download your pictures and place them on myspace or wait until a better invention is created. It is like having a job and you know the company is going to shut down. What are you going to do cry and become upset? Of course not you will pack your things and find another job, so lets move on.</p>

<p>Don't take down Facebook!!!! Ever since I moved… It's been the ONLY way I can talk to my friends and connect with family far away! I need Facebook! Without… I don't know what I'll do! This website is really important! Don't let all your hard work go to waste! Why don't you just get a team of people to help you run the site? You don't have to do it all alone!</p>

<p>Will Facebook End on March 15th? no of course not, it is just another one of those silly rumors spreading across the net, this time started of by the website, which of course then started spreading through twitter.____Mark Zuckerberg may be a little philanthropic from time to time with his cash, but he is not ready to throw in the towel and just close down the entire website that has a net worth of around $50 billion.____But, hey, we all know that, surely most people can really see through this rumor pretty quickly. At least it is a rather harmless rumor and really just a bit of fun. Much better than the ones that were circulating the net at the start of the year, claiming some well known celebrities had died.____So Facebook fans across the planet, all 500 million plus of them, need not worry. No need to go out and start closing down your account and start looking for a facebook alternative, to fill in a vacant space in your life. Facebook is not coming to an end and is likely to be around for a very long time yet.____</p>

<p>this is bullshit. the stuff said makes no sense, why would zuckerburg say "I personally don’t think it’s a big deal,” “And to be honest, I think it’s for the better. Without Facebook, people will have to go outside and make real friends. That’s always a good thing.” He invented the site so people can connect with real friends. This is a contradiction in itself.</p>

<p>IF this is true, will it stop Zuckerberg if someone committed suicide because this s*** a.k.a. my life shuts down? Just wondering.. I'm a teenager and I can't live without facebook, but just to let parents know, facebook shutting down isn't gonna make talking to your teen easier. And, making REAL friends, ain't that what school and your job's for? My REAL friends have facebook. Some don't have phones or can't text or they don't check their phones. And even though drama is annoying, I like to keep up with it. See what's going on. IF facebook does shut down, s*** is gonna go down.</p>

<p>I disapprove of the removal of Facebook. Because without it we won’t be able to talk to people across the globe that are friends. We rather do that then being charge with long distance charges and also how could we remove every picture we have on there and put it on our computer ? Facebook is a place where you can play games, status what’s happening in your life, easy place to look for information. It isn’t our faults if we go on the computer, its not ruining our lives, it just you that’s making that happen. If you don’t want your kids, teenagers, clients to go on Facebook tell them not to. Don’t blame Facebook for its doing when you can’t control it.</p>

<p>Facebook idea is a gift and idea given by God. He should confirm if is time to End, cos is a means to reachout to the world. I will advice the belivers of christ to see an opportnity to have a great community to save life and win souls for God’s Kingdom. Let us buy Facebook from him and use it as a means to spread the gospel more. Growing the faith in christ.My advise to him is to let the idea live, He should sell it out to those who can manage. Cos if all the great men that invent something, destroyed it, we won’t have airplane, electricity, cars etc. Don’t ever kill a dream or vision because of the challenge you face. I love facebook idea. FACEBOOK (Bringing the world together)</p>

<p>Stand up guy, we all love facebook, but i think it has taken the actual social aspect of our lives away people are so consumed with goin on on facebook instead of whats actually goin on around them! Its ruined peoples lives, marriages, relationships, its affecting peoples employment! Im glad their goin out on top! Now people will actually have to talk to u or call u!</p>

<p>I think it is a good idea.  It will give everyone a wake up call as to how lonely and pathetic their lives really are.  They will come to the realization that they actually don't have friends, no one really cares about their stupid news feed, and that they don't have a life.  "Oh, what am I going to do" is what they will cry.  Why don't you go enroll yourself in a skydiving class, or learn how to waltz.  People spend so much time on that stupid site it makes me sick.  I thought texting on the phone was bad.  Now my friends expect me to know what they are doing by reading their posts.  How about a phone call?  What ever happened to writing someone a letter?  People are wasting their times on that stupid site.  I am glad he is taking charge and putting an end to what he created.  Even the creator knows when to put an end to the madness…</p>

<p>facebook is like the best far distant website to use with friends who live miles away and myspace is wake but you dont see them giving up anytime soon. If you want your old life back and you want to give up on facebook then you should just sell it to someone so facebook will keep running and we can all keep in touch with our long distant friends and relitives.</p>

<p>You can’t shut down Facebook, it’s the only way I can stay intouch with most friends that I don’t want having my aim or phone number. Most don’t have an aim or a phone that I know. It’s the only way I can keep intouch with those friends who have moved away to the other side of the world. It’s not right for all of us. How about shutting down the facebooks that haven’t been active for over a year? It’s unfair for all of us who’s lives revolve around it, in my opinion its one of the best social networks out there next to aim. Give up the website to someone who thinks they can manage it, it shouldn’t be shut down. Its a great way to communicate with others. I don’t want to communicate through aim or email or always use up my text messages to text those who have my number and facebook.</p>

<p>This is obviously fake. Rumors are spreading which will probably get even MORE publicity and therefore, causing more people to come on. It's a hoax for more publicity and plus, if it were true, it would be all over Facebook and it should be said on facebook. If Fcebook goes down, so does many other businesses/jobs and people that they would have to pay back. I want to see how far people take this..</p>

<p>You are a dumb ass to think people will not be upset with this insidious decision. All the damn money you made through FaceBook, you could've paid any individual money to manage the site wihtout directly having to manage it. You decided to do all the stupid ass changes such as a new layout new applications etc. We were not pleased but we stuck by your side and continued to use the site. Now you took it upon yourself to shut it down without the democracy of your fans. You are a selfish ass fuck to society. I hope you go bankrupt so you and your "life" can come to terms with one another. Thanks for everything lame ass.</p>

<p>Please Please please don't do this if you are doing this  you are so making a big mistake so I suggest that you change your mind right because you are making alot of people upset about this  and those people who are happy about this are idiots you should really think about how other people feel instead of thinking about you so you  better keep facebook because alot people will never forgive you including and btw myspace is a piece of crap. You should really delete myspace instead of facebook. Facebook is the best site ever not myspace. You should really think about this before you delete this</p>

<p>I think he is just joking and trying to scare us he might not close it if he doesn't want anything to do with facebook he should sell it for someone else he should just sell it to someone rather than closing the site that where people are on facebook to chat with there family's and friend's that are far away that is a good site please do not shut down the site keep it running</p>

<p>See this is what happens when you take and idea make it better and the people who didn't do it better want to sue you because they weren't part of the billions.  Just give them the money and keep your head up.  The movie was great everyone should watch it.  It was a learning experience for me.  It shows how greedy people are and want to ride the coat tails of other people instead of trying to work something out where everyone can be rich let's not be greedy people there's always enough to go around</p>

<p>Just because Mark is stressed he is shutting down the most popular website. Does he know how many jobs he is cutting. IF HE IS TOO STRESSED, FIND SOMEONE ELSE TO BE IN CHARGE, AND JUST QUIT. Don't let everyone else suffer. Facebook is were EVERYONE reconnects with their old friends.</p>

<p>It's good that Facebook is ending because 1. Facebook is the number one cause from cyber bullying at schools. I think it will cut down on cyber bulllying 2. Some kids are on it to much anyway. They dont need that. They need to be helping at home or something. 3. Mark Z. is young he should live his life the way he wants it. Maybe  Facebook was fun at first, but now to him it's to much for him to handle !</p>

<p>Mate, what ever information you have on facebook i can find out in 10 mins, all i gotta do is type your last name is white pages and all your info comes up, so that would be the least of your problem because the Government knows when you were born and when you die. its all on papper.</p>

<p>this is not real, this cant be believable. just look at the way the article is written… "ruining my life"??? how professional an interview is that?! theres obviously big money in being the owner of facebook, and if anything, it would make ur life more economically stable, or in other words, BETTER…!</p>

<p>You won't get your old life back, life doesn't go back in time, it only goes forward, the past makes you who you are. By giving up your site, your not only taking something thats loved away from people, your going to try to make your past return, yes maybe less stress, but you have to admit if you lost it, youd miss it. Your life has changed and for a reason, is it worth it? Throwing away something you created?? -Casandra</p>

<p>I dont know weather to believe this or not. I really hope that they dont shut it down. My husband is in the army which means we dont get to see our families to often. Alot of us stay in contact through fb. Its more convenient. Thats not the only way we stay in contact but its easy. I dont spend my entire day on facebook either. I think thats a catagory for younger people. Not everyone. I also use facebook to stay in contact with my husband who is deployed. If you shut down this website, it will truelly make me sad and alot of other army wives to. I think you should seriously take the people who dont abuse facebook into consideration when you think about shutting it down. You dont know how many peoples lifes you are going to disrupt with making such a big move like that.. But like i said i dont even know if this is real or not…</p>

<p>He can't do it! He mustn't do it!<br/>
Facebook is a site where people can meet each other, to find out the newest news, we can expand/spread our business! IT IS NOT FAIR!!!<br/>
Does he know that there are accounts of celebrities? Does he?!?<br/>
Does he know how many contacts I/we acquired here? How many friendships I/we developed?!<br/>
IN FACT – HE DOESN'T!!!!! </p>
<p> I wish he could see this …<br/>
If the page has already been pressure for him, I/we don't care about that!<br/>
We are not responsible for it. And if he can't handle with this, it's better to sell this business!!!</p>

<p>Please let FB people keep FB up and running with safety guidelines.  People are reconnecting on a daily bases with lost family, friends, former students, teahers, near &amp; far, ministering to the lost and uplifting the saved when they are down and out!  The site is wonderful for the mature honest innocent crowd.  Yes there are many children that abuse the system, but that is due to lack of parental guidance.  Mark Z this site has been a HUGE BLESSING for many of us in various areas of our lives please rethink and find and alternative solution.  I would come work for FB NOW for that would help.  there are many people without jobs that would love to come work for FB that are MEMBERS and UNEMPLOYED that would GLADLY HELP YOU OUT!</p>

<p>hmm Seriously?? haven't anyone of you checked the content of this site??… I mean simple logic would tell you that this so called "news" is false.. i checked the other content and boom.. tuna head guy?? Killer Otter?? A yeti?? O and the best thing I saw was "How to Defend your home from Zombies".. So don't get too upset… nor be too happy.. though I'm not giving any assurance from anybody.. just thought of what was the bases of this news?? and compare their past performance to what their saying now… <img alt=":D" class="wp-smiley" src="http://web.archive.org/web/20110109052415im_/http://s0.wp.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif?m=1235145237g"/> </p>

<p>Facebook will shutdown? unbelievable! ALOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOT of people will get affected and like Facebook is important nowadays… Alot of people had Myspace or other social sites but Facebook is the most successful because of its qualities that others didnt have.. People didnt enjoy Myspace and others as much as they enjoyed Facebook… And i think if he's so stressed out why dont he hire more workers? im sure ALOT of people need jobs and more people working is better and will make the site more safer</p>

<p>Idont thnk that this is a smart thing to do. What about the people who are ill and cant get outside. Or the people that have friends and family in other states or countries and facebook is the only way that they can communicate with them. This is a really poor choice. The maker of facebook.com should just sell it to a responsible person. There are also many companies that function and operate through facebook. There isnt any reason to just give up on facebook.</p>

<p>I personaly think it's true since they have all that evidence&amp; quotations. I'm a teenager&amp; I spend atleat 8hrs a day on facebook but I would be great to shut it down so I have more time to spend with friends, famley and more improtant thigs than stalking people's profiles, and posting lame statuses and lame comments. I try to get off facebook but it's like I'm attatched lls. Hope it's true! My mom would be glad and so will I. Come to think about it again, I've used Myspace before facebook for a while, and I don't think it's as good as FB is&amp; I wouldn't be able to communicate with far away friends that I've known for years anymore:(</p>

<p>Better to shut it down..!! Selling it to a 3rd party wont make a sense..!! All the hard efforts that zuck took for so long would be of no use..!! Definitely the pride new owner of the FB will not even bother to maintain it well for a long term..!! It'l loose the charm in it..!! Not only that…. The securities will go real bad..!! And they would never turn up with new ideas anyways..! Either run it out of ur brains else Shut it down and enjoy the rest of your life.. <img alt=":D" class="wp-smiley" src="http://web.archive.org/web/20110109052415im_/http://s0.wp.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif?m=1235145237g"/> <img alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" src="http://web.archive.org/web/20110109052415im_/http://s2.wp.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif?m=1235145237g"/> </p>

<p>noooooooooooooooo this cant be happening. do u know how many people benefit from this facebook thing. The world wont be the same without this. there is a lot of businesses all over the world that have benefited from this facebook website and it is going to affect them badly when they find out that there is going to be no more facebook. i think he should think twice before making that move or let sombody else take it over. facebook is a great discovery and people respect the founder of this social network (Facebook) and if it is deleted people would not forgive you for what u have done.</p>

<p>After just having watched Social Network, I can relate to "stressful". Then again, that is the price to pay for "billions" of dollars. So unless this is a farce and Mark Zuckerberg is simply up to something is perhaps the best answer to this news (if it is true).  </p>
<p>Besides, if you cannot handle it, why not sell it for more than what it is worth (reportedly $25 billion according to the move Social Network.</p>

<p>let me give him business advanes when a business is too hard to controll you create more workers and brances .pls don’t shut fb it will cause mental problem if there is no fb i am going to miss my friends which i can no longer meet. pls shuting down is not the problem find a solution pls.</p>
<p>remeber so if you create another business that is sucessfull the next option is to close it down pls you need business cancelling .</p>

<p>hey zuckerberg… don't shut down facebook.. many people are relying on facebook to communicate with their relatives,friends and love ones in other countries. if you can't handle the pressure, try selling it to another company.. you will gain money for sure.</p>

<p>LMAO all these people take Facebook so seriously. If its shutting down, which I doubt, the smartest thing to do is just get the numbers of those you really care about. Half of you are probably in high school with over 500 friends you've never seen in your life lol. If Zuckerberg wants to end his company who's to say he can't?</p>

<p>I don't want FB to go either. On one hand, if it's true, then there won't be any false people on there. On there other hand. I wouldn't be able to know when or where anything is happening. We souldn't beleive everything on the internet though.</p>

<p>This is messed up.. Facebook should not be shut down when this is the best way to communicate through friends and family mostly.. I'm sorry I may be an adult who may need to stop being so addicted to Facebook especially with the pics and the commenting but u know most people enjoy Facebook because it the only way to communicate and become fans and do stuff when it a lot of things to do on it.. Yes it may of been too much for Facebook for the working and all and I can understand that but u know maybe instead of shutting it down set some boundaries instead so it can people won't be miserable without it when I betcha a lot of people r not going to be happy on what you are going to do Mark because let me tell you it messed up and mostly  FUCKED UP !!!!!</p>

<p>Is amazing, how people accuse others of being pretenders, gossipers…we must all look in the mirror before pointing your finger…some time in our lives, we have been pretenders and gossipers…He or she who is free of sin, cast the first stone..whether facebook stays or not is only up to the founder or founders… I personally enjoy fb because it has kept me in touch with my family from all over the world and all over the United States.  Also because it has opened a door for me to speak of our Lord Jesus Christ…have a wonderful year 2011..love one another instead, this world would definitely be a better place…God bless.</p>

<p>I wonder if they care about the people like me who can't contact extended family outside of facebook. It's a sad excuse, but there are families like that who don't meet up ofter, or are feuding so badly the kids can't  even see Grandparents, uncles, aunts, cousins…  honestly, I don't use facebook all the time, maybe once a day for an hour to catch up with family I don't see often. But if this guys got his head so far up his ass he can't seem to see what some people are going through, that's fine. The world is full of bastards like that anyway…</p>

<p>if they planned on closing fb why would they come out with new electronics just now with facebook already set up into it i mean come on their just as bad as the national enquiror lmao and many people are still stupid enough to by that shit but in all reality it wouldnt make sense for companies to include facebook in their product if they new it was closing cause their sales would drop big time think before pannik thats my modo</p>

<p>What the?&gt;<br/>
I think your ideas are wrong.  especially this:<br/>
"people will have to go outside and make real friends. That’s always a good thing" </p>
<p>Some of us. are using Facebook. so that we can avoid vices. Like using some ciggars. we use our hands in typing or whatever. so that we can forget the ciggars and so we can avoid it. &gt;.&lt;</p>

<p>idont think it's really neccesairly tuhh close down because like people found their old friends from whenn they were little andd actually got to compunicate back withh themm and if it does shut-down someone can always put it back and take owner andd claim it</p>

<p>Facebook is more than teens stuck to the computer screen its a way for people who live far away to communicate with eachother for family to see pictures of and communicate with their sons,daughters,grand children, etc. Facebook has become a way of life for many people all over America. If they can’t take it anymore sell it to someone who can. If they shut down Facebook they’re shutting down a piece of all the people who log in day in and day out. They would be shutting down a piece of our hearts.</p>
