<h1><a name="Summary">Executive Summary</a></h1>
<p>The Joint Chiefs of Staff have provided military planners with an
      operationally based template for the evolution of the Armed Forces over
      the next several years (Joint Vision 2010). Based on this emerging
      framework, future operational concepts will require improved command,
      control, and intelligence. The ability to collect, process, and
      disseminate an uninterrupted flow of information, while exploiting or
      denying the enemy’s ability to do the same, is paramount to the
      success of these new strategies. Assured access to the radio frequency
      (RF) spectrum will thus be at least as critical to the military in the
      future as it is today.</p>
<p>Although many individuals and organizations use the spectrum, the
      military faces unique challenges in its spectrum operations. Military
      communications-electronics systems perform a wide variety of functions,
      many of which must be performed simultaneously on comparatively small
      platforms or by units in close proximity to one another. Military
      aircraft, for example, must not only perform voice communications,
      radionavigation, and radar surveillance operations, they also have
      uniquely military requirements such as sustaining multiple radar tracks of
      hostile forces, launching and controlling weapons, conducting data
      communications and/or relay with cooperating units, jamming hostile
      sensors, and performing counter-countermeasures when necessary.
      Successfully performing all of these spectrum dependent functions in the
      face of active attempts by hostile forces to jam and disrupt their
      operations, demands various control measures that in turn require
      sufficient spectrum to be effective. Limiting the tuning capability of
      military systems by decreasing their available spectrum inherently
      increases their vulnerability to hostile attack and self-induced
      interference.</p>
<p>Technologically superior equipment has been critical to our past combat
      successes. We must maintain this edge even as we face the wider range of
      threats our technologically advanced adversaries will employ. Many recent
      developments in military technology, including anti-stealth and portable
      mine detection radars, integrated aircraft avionics, and secure, high
      capacity communications, require greater spectrum access rather than less.
      In the case of the highly mobile, and often life threatening operations of
      the military, there simply are no alternatives to using the spectrum. </p>
<p>In light of its increasing information requirements, DoD is continuing
      to participate in, and often leads, efforts to develop spectrum efficient
      methods and technologies. Long-term goals include the development of
      technologies such as adaptive, software-driven equipment and advanced
      spectrum management techniques. Mid-term initiatives include a multi-layer
      national technology thrust in aerospace communications efficiency, with
      immediate emphasis on developing and implementing new, efficient
      modulation techniques. However, technology advances and their
      implementation in military systems, doctrine, and training cannot occur
      overnight. It is imperative that we devise and adhere to an orderly
      transition from legacy technologies and methods to those of tomorrow. An
      orderly transition is critical if we are to sustain the military readiness
      and superiority required for the broad range of deterrent, conflict
      prevention, and peacetime activities that we will face in the foreseeable
      future. Preserving access to the spectrum resources required by today’s
      military is a prerequisite for the transitions to follow.</p>
<p>As illustrated in the table below, military access to the spectrum is
      being increasingly constrained in the face of increasing requirements.
      Many of the military technology advantages employed today and planned for
      tomorrow rely heavily on access to specific portions of the
      electromagnetic spectrum. Unfortunately, the same spectrum, that below 5
      to 6 GHz, is of great value to both military and commercial applications.
      In fact, over ninety percent of DoD’s permanent frequency assignments
      are registered in bands below 3 GHz. </p>

<p>One of the DoD’s major concerns is the increasingly rapid rate at
      which reallocations are mandated. The report to Congress for Title VI of
      the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA-93) was submitted after 18
      months of analysis and negotiation. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997
      (BBA-97) was signed into law on 8 August 1997 with NTIA’s report on
      Title III due back to Congress in six months (delivered 8 February 1998).<i>
</i> NTIA made its first spectrum band selection for BBA-97 during the
      second week of September 1997 and requested impacts and cost analysis by
      30 November 1997. Selected bands were changed several times over the
      following months, and the final decision on band selection was not made
      until early January 1998. The DoD, as primary user of these bands, will
      experience major cost impacts and impairments to critical missions as a
      result of the reallocations. Adequate time is necessary to conduct the
      appropriate analysis and research required if we are to minimize the
      impacts of spectrum reallocations.</p>
<p>This report identifies the following for the spectrum identified by NTIA
      for reallocation as a result of OBRA-93. </p>
<p>· Current missions and functions performed in each band</p>
<p>· Primary systems in each band and their estimated operational
      lifetimes</p>
<p>· Estimates of the costs associated with the reallocations</p>
<p>· Details regarding the cost drivers associated with each of the
      estimates</p>
<p>· The nature and severity of anticipated operational impacts</p>
<p>· The primary sites affected by the reallocation and an assessment
      of the impact for those sites</p>
<p>A previous report identifies similar information regarding the spectrum
      identified for reallocation by BBA-97. (1) </p>
<p>The DoD’s greatest concern is the operational impacts that will
      result from spectrum reallocations. The impacts discussed in this report
      are in the context of a National defense posture that will remain
      unchanged for the foreseeable future. This posture requires that our
      forces receive adequate training and be prepared for short notice
      deployment to regional hotspots throughout the world. There is also a
      continuing requirement for non-combat operations worldwide as the military
       continues to participate in a broad range of deterrent, conflict
      prevention, and peacekeeping activities. No medium other than the RF
      spectrum can support the DoD’s attendant mobility and flexibility
      requirements. Critical missions and operations affected by reallocations
      include surveillance and control of North American airspace, air launched
      missile control and precision strike test and training operations, and
      aeronautical telemetry operations that support flight testing of aircraft,
      spacecraft, and missiles at major military test ranges and facilities.</p>
<p>The NTIA intended to provide the means to continue some of DoD’s
      critical operations by reallocating some of the spectrum on a ‘Mixed
      Use’ basis and by providing selected area protection zones where
      military use of the spectrum will be permitted to continue for a specified
      time. The DoD is concerned that these means will neither provide for the
      military’s needs nor prevent EMI between Federal and non-Federal
      operations. For example, the DoD’s airborne tactical communications
      are not protected by the zones identified for the 139-140.5 and 141.5-143
      MHz bands reallocated by BBA-97. In fact, in some cases, a single
      protection zone is proposed for multiple sites that are geographically
      separated by a distance greater than the diameter of the protection zone.</p>
<p>Of additional concern to the DoD is the cost of implementing OBRA-93 and
      BBA-97 reallocations. Although analysis is ongoing, estimates to date
      clearly show that the costs will be substantial. Both low and high cost
      estimates are presented herein, along with identification of the
      uncertainties and expected conditions that will strongly influence the
      ultimate cost. The low and high estimates of OBRA-93 reallocation costs
      are $247.2M and $1,240.2M, respectively. The OBRA-93 reallocation costs
      reported herein are based on information provided to NTIA as part of the
      OBRA-93 band selection process. Estimates of the BBA-97 reallocation costs
      range from a low of $436M<b><i> </i></b>to a high of $2,518M, as
      reported in Reference 1<b><i>.</i></b> The total estimated cost of both
      reallocations is between $520.3M and $2,701.5M. These totals, identified
      below, take into account the combined costs of both reallocations and
      include the effect of reallocating bands for BBA-97 that are adjacent to
      those reallocated by OBRA-93. </p>

<p>An estimated low cost / high cost approach was employed to account for
      the complexities and technical, policy, and doctrinal uncertainties
      associated with constraining the operation of systems supporting critical
      functions such as continental air defense, tactical radio relay, missile
      telecommand and guidance, and aeronautical flight-testing. The low cost /
      high cost estimate accommodates the uncertainties involved for cases where
      reducing the frequency availability would have an unknown impact on
      operational readiness. That is, if the missions can still be accomplished
      with the reduced-spectrum capability, the low cost estimate will be
      realized. If, on the other hand, the mission would be compromised by the
      reduced-spectrum capability, the estimated high cost would be required to
      develop other means to accomplish the mission. The same basic rationale
      applies to all bands and equipment included in this report.</p>
<p>More specific details describing individual system complexities and
      uncertainties regarding operational impacts are provided in the discussion
      that follows; however, low cost estimates generally consist of
      modifications to existing equipment to facilitate their operation in the
      remaining spectrum. High cost estimates generally consist of major
      equipment modifications or development of new, replacement systems that
      operate in an alternative frequency band. It should be noted, however,
      that numerous factors such as the physics of propagation, the density of
      current spectrum users, and concern regarding possible future
      reallocations make it extremely difficult for the DoD to gain access to
      alternative spectrum. </p>
<p>The OMB has requested that the DoD provide a description of the
      conditions, actions, regulations, or policies that would need to occur or
      be in place in order for DoD to realize the lowest cost impacts. (2)
      Obviously, both cost and operational impacts would be reduced if some or
      all of the planned spectrum reallocations were rescinded. Likewise, full
      reimbursement of the costs incurred as a result of OBRA-93 and BBA-97
      would negate reallocation costs to the DoD, provided adequate alternative
      spectrum was available.</p>
<p>Reference 2 also requested that the DoD identify any additional
      legislative or regulatory actions that could reduce cost or operational
      impacts to DoD. The DoD believes the following are actions that should be
      taken in this regard:</p>
<p>· Spectrum used by National Security systems should be exempted
      from reallocation.</p>
<p>· A footnote should be included in the National Table of
      Allocations authorizing use of the 1385-1400 MHz band by CINCNORAD radar
      assets during a national defense situation, as determined by CINCNORAD.</p>
<p>· Sufficient time and funds should be provided to conduct a
      thorough analysis of reallocation alternatives prior to drafting future
      spectrum reallocation legislation.</p>
<p>Solutions to the challenges arising from the impacts of spectrum
      reallocations are being aggressively pursued, and the DoD is expending
      significant resources to project its spectrum needs for the future. These
      are formidable tasks, however, since they include not only a determination
      of future operational scenarios and corresponding information requirements
      but also an informed estimate of the types and extent of future technology
      development. Completing such complex tasks will require time, as will
      migrating to any future spectrum management techniques and advanced
      technologies. The Defense Department requires adequate spectrum access to
      support National Defense missions in the interim. Measures that would help
      to mitigate the impacts of spectrum reallocations and assure adequate
      spectrum availability include:</p>
<p>· Instituting a moratorium on reallocation of spectrum used by DoD</p>
<p>· Rescinding the reallocation of spectrum that is not highly valued
      by the civil sector</p>
<p>· Mandating the identification of and guaranteed access to
      alternative spectrum for displaced DoD users</p>
<p>· Reimbursing the full costs incurred to migrate from one frequency
      band to another</p>
<p>· Implementing and enforcing equipment (transmitter and receiver)
      standards for all spectrum users.</p>
<p>While it is certain that advancements in technology and spectrum
      management techniques will enable more to be done with a given amount of
      spectrum, the demand for increased information capacity and the spectrum
      to support it has historically outpaced technological developments. Thus,
      the only long-term way to make adequate spectrum available for Government
      and non-Government needs is to develop technologies and practices that
      address the issue of sharing spectrum. Compatible spectrum sharing will
      not just happen, however. Apportioning the limited spectrum resource in
      the best interests of the American people requires the formation of a
      National Spectrum Plan to establish and protect our national priorities.</p>
<h1><a name="1390-1400">1390-1400 MHz</a></h1>
<h3>Overview of 1390-1400 MHz</h3>
<p>The 1390-1400 MHz band is used by the DoD for long-range air
      surveillance and air defense radars, drone control systems, tactical radio
      relay, and various data links. Simultaneous use of closely spaced radar,
      drone control systems, and data links is a requirement for test and
      training range operations.</p>
<p>The low cost estimate for reallocation of the 1390-1400 MHz band is
      $140M. This estimate is based on the assumptions that the Air Defense
      mission remains and that civil systems using the reallocated band are
      compatible with the military systems which will continue to operate in
      adjacent spectrum. That is, it is assumed that the addition of filters,
      crystals, and other appropriate hardware and software modifications will
      permit surveillance radar systems to operate at their full design
      capability. NTIA noted:(3) </p>
<blockquote>"… <i>adopting adequate regulatory and industry
      receiver standards for new non-Federal equipment in this band is essential
      to assure satisfactory performance of new non-Federal services in bands
      adjacent to Federal high-power radars</i>."</blockquote>
<p>The low cost estimate includes the costs of modifications to the radar
      systems and the minimum estimated amounts for replacing the Multi-Service
      Target Control System (MSTCS) and the Range Application Joint Program
      Office (RAJPO) data links. Although there would be some adverse impact, it
      was assumed that extensive modifications would not be required for Army
      tactical systems to operate on new frequencies. The primary cost drivers
      for the low estimate are the software modifications and the acquisition
      and installation of filters and crystals in surveillance radar systems,
      and the low cost estimate for replacement of the MSTCS and RAJPO data
      links.</p>
<p>The high cost estimate for reallocation of the 1390-1400 MHz band is
      $1,033M. This estimate is based on the assumption that the remaining
      available frequencies will not provide sufficient spectrum resources to
      support today’s air defense radar systems and that major hardware
      modifications will be required. The high cost estimate also includes the
      high estimates for replacing the MSTCS and RAJPO data links. Although
      there would be some adverse impact, it was assumed that extensive
      modifications would not be required for Army tactical systems to operate
      on new frequencies. The primary cost drivers for the high estimate are the
      major modifications to surveillance radar systems and replacement of the
      MSTCS and RAJPO data links. </p>
<p>Reallocation of this band significantly degrades the ability of the DoD’s
      primary surveillance radar systems to detect intrusion into our nation’s
      airspace in peacetime and operations other than war (OOW). The quality of
      performance for these missions depends, in some cases, on radar emissions
      at two separate frequencies. DoD is concerned that reduced spectrum assets
      will also degrade the radar’s operational anti-jam capabilities.</p>
<h3>OBRA-93 Summary for 1390-1400 MHz</h3>
<p>NTIA identified the 1390-1400 MHz band for reallocation on an Exclusive,
      non-Federal use basis beginning in January 1999. Federal systems are
      permitted to continue operations at the seventeen sites listed in Table 1
      for fourteen years from the reallocation date.</p>

<h3>Major Functions and Missions</h3>
<p>The 1350-1400 MHz band is used in conjunction with the 1215-1240 MHz,
      1240-1300 MHz, and 1300-1350 MHz bands for long-range radars, aeronautical
      radio location, drone control, and tactical radio relay.</p>
<p>The DoD and Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) operate the Joint
      Surveillance System (JSS) radar network on frequencies throughout the
      1215-1400 MHz band. The JSS provides coverage of the US perimeter for
      radionavigation, air and fleet defense, and drug interdiction. The lower
      25 MHz of this band (1215-1240 MHz) is used by GPS and GLONASS navigation
      receivers that operate using very low level signals. </p>
<p>Paired band data links in the 1350-1400 MHz band are used in conjunction
      with those in the 1427-1435 MHz band to rebroadcast aircraft position
      during tests and training. The RAJPO data link system is deployed at all
      major military aircraft and missile test centers and is used in flight
      testing of aircraft for each of the Services.</p>
<p>Additional uses of the 1350-1400 MHz band include the Navy’s MK 23
      Target Acquisition System (TAS) and AN/TPS-59 tactical radar and the Army’s
      tactical transportable radio relay systems. </p>

<h3>Assumptions and Cost Drivers</h3>
<p><b>ARSR-4</b>. The ARSR-4 system supports surveillance (JSS and air
      defense warning) missions at numerous sites around the perimeter of the
      US. The ARSR-4’s air traffic control (ATC) mission is constrained
      during peacetime operations to the 1240-1370 MHz frequency range. The loss
      of 10 MHz at 1390-1400 MHz will impact the dual-channel frequency hopping
      capability that is key to the ARSR-4 design. </p>

<p>N.A. = not available </p>
<p>Reallocation will, at a minimum, require system software modifications,
      circulator replacement, and the installation of new filters and crystals
      at an estimated cost of $35M. If the remaining available frequencies
      cannot support the dual-channel frequency-hopping requirement, major
      additional hardware modifications will be required at an estimated cost of
      $525M and will require 5 years to complete.</p>
<p><b>AN/FPS-117.</b> The AN/FPS-117 has a surveillance (air defense
      warning) mission, primarily in Alaska. The radar is designed to operate on
      twenty frequencies (channels) up to 1400 MHz, in both peacetime and crisis
      situations. Loss of channels results in degraded radar performance,
      potentially creating gaps in radar coverage of North America and
      jeopardizing the NORAD Integrated Tactical Attack and Warning Assessment
      system’s mission. Currently channels 1,16, and 20 are not used at all
      AN/FPS-117 sites, in order to prevent interference with other systems.
      Some sites have additional channels unavailable due to site-specific
      interference concerns. The following actions are necessary, as a result of
      OBRA-93, to alleviate concerns over the implications of secondary use of
      the spectrum, even at remote sites:</p>
<p>· Transmission requirements. Software modifications for a frequency
      synthesizer will be required to preclude the use of the reallocated
      channels and to retain the radar’s operational capabilities within
      the remaining band.</p>
<p>· Reception requirements. A hardware modification will be required
      to replace the frequency oscillators with a frequency synthesizer and to
      prevent use of the 1390-1400 band segment.</p>
<p>· Mission requirements. Target detection will not be affected by
      civil sources transmitting in 1390-1400 MHz; however, commercial sources
      may be reported as false detections. If this occurs, a hardware
      modification will be required to eliminate the problem.</p>
<p>· Calibration and Maintenance Requirements. The loss of 1390-1400
      MHz will require modification of the software used for calibration,
      monitoring, and fault isolation.</p>
<p>If replacement of major system components becomes necessary because the
      remainder of the band cannot accommodate mission requirements, costs are
      estimated at $350M. Past availability of the existing high-power,
      solid-state devices has lent itself to cost effective component savings
      and extended the system’s useful life. This is in direct correlation
      with preserving the mission requirement of Operational Availability with a
      minimal attended maintenance savings concept. </p>
<p><b>AN/FPS-124. </b>The AN/FPS-124 is a multi-channel frequency agile
      radar with a surveillance (air defense warning) mission that supports the
      Alaskan air defense network. The loss of the 1390-1400 MHz band reduces
      the probability of target detection and may result in the requirement to
      redesign and replace the system. Loss of the 10 MHz will also compound the
      difficulties of interference resolution with similar systems in Canada and
      Iceland. Radar operations in Alaska will continue on a secondary basis,
      meaning they would be shut down in the event of commercial interference.
      As a result, the North Warning System would lose its ability to provide
      targeting data and accurate surveillance information. Loss of these radars
      will allow coverage gaps for threats capable of delivering payloads to the
      North American continent to go undetected.</p>
<p>If interference occurs, a complete replacement of the system may be
      necessary since the remainder of the band cannot support the mission
      requirement. If system replacement becomes necessary, it will cost an
      estimated $130M and take 5 years to complete.</p>
<p><b>AN/PPQ-2(V)1 Tactical Radar.</b> The AN/PPQ-2 has a surveillance
      (air defense warning) mission. There will be a loss in the tuning range of
      the radar. A redesign of the radar will be required to limit operations to
      below 1390 MHz. Development of the redesigned radar constitutes the low
      and high cost estimates of $5M.</p>
<p><b>Multi-Service Target Control System.</b> MSTCS supports range
      operations (military training) missions. The data link for the MSTCS
      requires two frequencies within the 1350-1400 MHz band. This is a
      multi-user band, and frequencies used for transmission are chosen to
      reduce interference between the two MSTCS frequencies and between those
      frequencies used by the RAJPO Data Link System (DLS) and ARSR-4 radar
      systems. With the proposed reallocation, there may not be any clear
      frequencies available for the MSTCS at some test ranges without shutting
      down other systems. Therefore, a new frequency band for the MSTCS would be
      required in order to achieve interference free operation. Since the MSTCS
      data link was optimized for operation in the current band, moving to a new
      band would require extensive redesign, potentially wasting all of the
      incurred $20 to 40M investment costs, and incurring additional costs in
      test program delays. As indicated in Table 3, the system replacement cost
      has not been determined.</p>
<p><b>RAJPO Tri-Service Air/Ground Data Link. </b>RAJPO supports range
      operations (military test and training) missions by providing precise
      position and velocity data. The RAJPO DLS was designed with a number of 3
      MHz wide channels, selectable within software control. A minimum of three
      channels, separated by some minimum required number of megahertz, are
      necessary to support a given mission. Therefore, the maximum number of
      missions possible at a given range or within a geographic area is
      dependent on the number of available channels, and fewer available
      channels equates to fewer test missions per unit time. The Southwestern US
      is one example where spectrum congestion is an issue within a RAJPO DLS
      operation area. Within this area, there are six test and training
      facilities in close proximity to each other, each requiring unique and
      compatible DLS frequencies for simultaneous, interference-free operations.
      There are also several FAA and DoD radars in the region whose frequencies 
      must be avoided in order to prevent interference. The close proximity of
      the test and training ranges creates conditions that use up most of the
      available spectrum in the 1350-1400 MHz band. Interference prevention is
      compounded by the frequent need to use the RAJPO DLS and MSTCS together
      during the same operation. If the ranges are unable to perform
      simultaneous operations, it will limit their ability to effectively
      schedule test events. The Air Force estimated that the costs due to delays
      in aircraft testing may exceed $1M per occurrence. The costs to the Army
      and Navy for test delays are similar and are in addition to those of the
      Air Force. Flight test and range personnel, as well as specialized range
      hardware are idled during delays in testing, but still incur costs. These
      potential program delay costs are not included in Table 3, due to the
      uncertainties involved. However, in order to avoid the costs and
      operational impacts associated with flight test delays, it will be
      necessary to modify RAJPO. Modifying the RAJPO will result in an estimated
      nonrecurring cost of $10M and an estimated recurring cost totaling $13M,
      and will take 5 years to complete.</p>
<p><b>MK-23 Shipborne Radar.</b><i> </i>The MK-23 radar has a
      surveillance (shipborne air defense warning) mission. Although the use of
      frequencies registered within the government master file (GMF) is
      generally authorized for operation no closer than 100 nautical miles (nmi)
      from the coast, and are on a non-interference basis (NIB), various highly
      populated areas have pre-coordinated authorization for co-primary use of
      the affected channels within 100 nmi of the coast. Reducing the available
      tuning range of this system will reduce the anti-jamming and interference
      margin of the radar, making it more susceptible to interference from new
      and existing systems operating in the remaining portion of the band. The
      impact of losing part of the system’s tuning range is particularly
      severe if, as frequently happens, two or more ships are operating within
      200 nmi of each other. Such interference can be severe enough to render
      the radar incapable of detecting targets and performing its mission. The
      Navy will implement operational procedures to restrict the system’s
      tuning range in coastal waters.</p>
<p><b>AN/TPS-59 Tactical Radar.</b><i> </i>This radar has a surveillance
      (air defense warning) mission. The Marine Corps operates the AN/TPS-59
      long-range air surveillance radar and point-to-point digital, wide band
      communication systems in the 1215-1400 MHz band. Operational procedures
      will be implemented to restrict the tuning of these systems to below 1390
      MHz.</p>
<p><b>Operational Impacts and Assessment of Impact</b></p>
<p><b>AN/FPS-117/AN/FPS-124/ARSR-4 Radars.</b><i> </i>There are 33
      AN/FPS-117 sites across Alaska, Northern Canada, Hawaii, and Iceland; 40
      AN/FPS-124 sites across Alaska and Northern Canada; and 44 ARSR-4 sites
      around the perimeter of the continental US, Alaska, and Hawaii.
      Collectively, these radars are our primary system for detection and
      interception of unidentified and/or hostile, atmospheric weapon delivery
      systems. They are used to maintain our air sovereignty, support ATC, and
      for drug interdiction missions. In order to avoid gaps in coverage, these
      radars operate within view of one another, and in fact, overlapping
      coverage of critical sectors is a direct mission requirement. Decreased
      survivability, increased susceptibility to jamming, and the potential for
      gaps in the radar coverage of North America will result from the loss of
      the full design operating frequency range. This, in turn, presents a
      serious deficiency in the overall Integrated Tactical Warning Attack
      Assessment (ITW/AA) system and its Atmospheric Early Warning Systems. The
      system’s current implementation of diplexing, i.e., the use of dual
      frequencies, provides the necessary high accuracy and clarity for target
      detection. Diplexing also provides the user with the ability to avoid
      interference with adjacent systems, and with the capability to operate in
      a jamming environment without jeopardizing continuity of operations.
      Narrowing the operating frequency range greatly degrades NORAD’s
      ability to avoid radar-to-radar system interference and hostile jamming.</p>
<p><b>MSTCS.</b><i> </i>MSTCS is a developmental program whose immediate
      goal is to provide a common control system for unmanned target vehicles,
      initially at three DoD ranges, and whose ultimate goal is to extend that
      system to all DoD ranges. The data link for the MSTCS has been designed to
      operate on two frequencies within the 1350-1390 MHz band. This is a
      multi-user band, and frequencies used for transmission are chosen to
      reduce interference between the two MSTCS frequencies and between those
      frequencies used by the RAJPO DLS and the ARSR-4 radars. With the loss of
      the proposed spectrum, there may be no clear frequencies available for the
      MSTCS at some test ranges without shutting down other systems.</p>
<p><b>RAJPO Tri-Service Air/Ground Data Link.</b> The DoD’s
      investment in the RAJPO DLS may be jeopardized if continued access to the
      1350-1400 MHz band is not available. The loss of the proposed bandwidth
      may eliminate the ability to conduct simultaneous independent operations
      at some test ranges.</p>
<p><b>Primary Sites Affected and Assessment of Impact</b></p>
<p><b>RAJPO Tri-Service Air/Ground Data Link.</b> Table 4 lists some of
      the military base locations provided with protection zones for the
      1390-1400 MHz band, as a part of OBRA-93. Note that protection for the
      indicated zones will only last through 2008. The indicated protection
      zones are far too small to apply to current operations at these sites.
      First, the radius of operation for air vehicles generally exceeds the
      protection zones, as shown in the table, and second, the radio
      line-of-sight for an aircraft at a typical flight test altitude of 36,000
      feet is over 400 km. This means that an aircraft near the edge of its
      operating area may already be outside the protection zone, and it has a
      potential radio interference range that extends up to an additional 400
      km. For example, test flights at Patuxent River, MD, could cause
      interference to new civil users of the 1390-1400 MHz band in the entire
      Washington, DC/Baltimore, MD area, and vice versa. Likewise, similar
      flights at Edwards AFB can interact with the entire Los Angeles area.</p>

<h1><a name="1427-1432">1427-1432 MHz</a></h1>
<h3>Overview of 1427-1432 MHz</h3>
<p>The 1427-1432 MHz band is used for tactical radio relay, test range
      aeronautical telemetry, and telecommand for various types of guided
      weapons systems. </p>
<p>The cost estimate for reallocation of this band is $23M. This estimate
      is based on the assumption that range telemetry can continue in the
      1432-1435 MHz band and that the loss of spectrum will not severely degrade
      the system’s capability. Degraded operation of range telemetry
      equipment will cause scheduling delays, and modifications will be required
      to control systems to maintain safe and reliable telecommand of launched
      missiles, range scoring systems, and Tethered Aerostat Radar Systems
      (TARS). It was also assumed that airborne weapon command and guidance
      systems need to be retrofitted to use the 1432-1435 MHz band if they are
      presently wired for the 1427-1432 MHz band. Although there would be
      adverse impact, it was assumed that tactical communications could be
      accomplished in other bands.</p>
<p>Reallocation of this band causes negative impacts on weapons systems
      inventory readiness and on the training of pilots to use of those weapons.
      The impact is compounded because the weapons data link that operates in
      this band is also a critical component of major new missile system
      acquisitions.</p>
<h3>OBRA-93 Summary for 1427-1432 MHz</h3>
<p>NTIA identified the 1427-1432 MHz band for reallocation on an Exclusive,
      non-Federal use basis beginning in January 1999. Military airborne
      operations will be continued for nine years at the fourteen sites listed
      in Table 6. </p>
<h3>Major Functions and Missions</h3>
<p>This band is used by the military for tactical radio relay
      communications, military test range aeronautical radiolocation, telemetry,
      telecommand, and various types of guided weapon systems.</p>
<p>Paired band data links in 1350-1400 and 1427-1435 MHz rebroadcast
      aircraft position during tests and training. This system is deployed at
      all major military aircraft and missile test centers and is used in flight
      testing of aircraft for each of the Services.</p>

<h3>Assumptions and Cost Drivers</h3>
<p><b>RAJPO Tri-Service Air/Ground Data Link.</b> RAJPO supports range
      operations (military test and training) missions. The Southwestern US is
      one example where spectrum congestion is an issue within a RAJPO DLS
      operation area. Within this area, there are six test and training
      facilities in close proximity to each other, each requiring unique and
      compatible DLS frequencies for simultaneous, interference-free operations.
      The close proximity of these ranges creates conditions that require the
      use of all presently available spectrum in both the 1350-1400 MHz and
      1427-1435 MHz bands in order to prevent interference. Interference
      prevention is compounded by the frequent need to use the RAJPO DLS and
      MSTCS together on the same operation. Delays result when the ranges are
      unable to perform simultaneous operations. The Air Force estimated that
      the costs due to delays in aircraft testing may exceed $1M per occurrence.
      The costs to the Army and Navy for test delays are similar and are in 
      addition to those of the Air Force. None of these test delay costs are
      included in the cost tables. In order to avoid the costs and operational
      impacts associated with flight test delays, it will be necessary to modify
      RAJPO at an estimated cost of $23M.</p>
<p><b>AWW-13 Data Link.</b><i> </i>The AWW-13 has a Command, Control and
      Communications data link mission. The loss of the 1427-1432 MHz band will
      impair the operations of Navy missile command and guidance telemetry
      systems, ultimately affecting weapon system testing and training. Navy
      pilots adhere to the “train as we will fight” policy when
      training and testing airborne weapons systems. The normal test and
      training missions are conducted at an altitude of 36,000 feet. At this
      altitude, the weapons are well within line-of-sight of adjacent, major
      metropolitan areas. Missiles in the inventory have factory-fixed
      frequencies of operation within the 1427-1432 MHz band and their expected
      service life runs well into the next century.</p>
<p><b>Operational Impacts and Assessment of Impact</b></p>
<p><b>RAJPO Tri-Service Air/Ground Data Link.</b><i> </i>The Air Force,
      Army, and Navy all operate the RAJPO DLS in this band. The RAJPO DLS is
      operated in the vicinity of twenty-two DoD test and training ranges, and
      in the broad areas covered by their associated airspace, to relay precise
      air vehicle locations to ground control locations and ground systems. The
      RAJPO DLS is crucial to the flight testing of many high value aircraft. To
      achieve the required communications reliability, this system operates in
      both the 1350-1400 and 1427-1435 MHz bands. NTIA has stated:(4) </p>
<p><i>"A concern in reallocating this band (1427-1432 MHz) involves
      the RAJPO GPS Data Link System. To achieve the designed communications
      reliability under low-level flight conditions, simultaneous dual frequency
      usage is required, with adequate frequency separation to assure reliable
      communications. Since adequate frequency separation is not available
      solely within 1350-1400 MHz, continued primary access to a minimum of 3
      MHz in the 1429-1435 MHz band is essential, if this $70M Federal
      investment is to be preserved."</i></p>
<p><b>Navy Weapons Development.</b><i> </i>The 1427-1435 MHz band is used
      for proficiency training using various guided weapon systems. The weapon
      systems and supporting data links that operate in this band include the
      AWW-13 Advanced Data Link, used in the Walleye and SLAM. The current Navy
      inventory includes approximately 200 Walleye and 800 SLAM weapon systems.
      The loss of this band for missile command operations will render Navy
      systems more susceptible to jamming and will impair their terminal
      guidance. Compounding the problem are developmental weapons, such as the
      Joint Standoff Weapon Unitary (JSOW Unitary), that will use the AWW-13.
      The AWW-13 requires spectrum for both command and video functions.</p>
<p><b>Primary Sites Affected and Assessment of Impact</b></p>
<p>Table 9 lists the military base locations provided with protection zones
      for the 1427-1432 MHz band, as a part of OBRA-93. The indicated protection
      zones are far too small to protect normal operations at these sites.
      First, the radius of operation for air vehicles generally exceeds the
      protection zones, as shown in the table, and second, the radio
      line-of-sight for an aircraft at a typical flight test altitude of 36,000
      feet is over 400 km. This means that an aircraft near the edge of its
      operating area may already be outside the protection zone, and it has a
      potential radio interference range that extends up to an additional 400
      km. Examples of the potential impact of these conditions are that test
      flights at Patuxent River, MD, which can cause interference to new civil
      users of the 1427-1432 MHz band in the entire Washington, DC/Baltimore, MD
      area, and vice versa. Likewise, similar effects could occur for flights at
      Edwards AFB, affecting the entire Los Angeles area.</p>

<h1><a name="1670-1675">1670-1675 MHz</a></h1>
<h3>Overview of 1670-1675 MHz</h3>
<p>The Air Force operates radiosondes and Mark IVB Meteorological Satellite
      (MetSat) Ground Terminals in this band. The radiosondes will be phased out
      of the inventory prior to the scheduled reallocation date, and the Mark
      IVB receivers will be retuned to operate in the remainder of the 1675-1700
      MHz band. Reallocation costs for this band will be minimal.</p>
<h3>OBRA-93 Summary for 1670-1675 MHz</h3>
<p>NTIA identified the 1670-1675 MHz band for reallocation on a Mixed,
      Federal/non-Federal use basis beginning in January 1999. Provisions were
      made to allow non-Federal use at a limited number of sites providing the
      non-Federal use was engineered to be fully compatible with Federal
      operations. Two National Oceanagraphic and Atmospheric Administration
      (NOAA) meteorological-satellite service earth station sites (Wallops
      Island, Virginia and Fairbanks, Alaska) were afforded protection for
      continued operations.</p>
<h3>Major Functions and Missions</h3>
<p>The Air Force operates an undetermined number of radiosondes and seven
      MARK IVB Meteorological Satellite Ground Terminals in this band.</p>
<h3>Primary Systems</h3>

<h3>Low and High Cost Estimates</h3>
<p>The estimated total cost to retune the Mark IVB receivers is $15,000.</p>
<h3>Assumptions and Cost Drivers</h3>
<p>The costs to comply with the reallocation plan are associated with
      retuning the Mark IVB receivers that currently operate in the band.</p>
<p><b>Operational Impacts and Assessment of Impact</b></p>
<p>In order to comply with the reallocation plan, the Air Force will cycle
      all of the radiosondes that operate in this band out of its inventory
      prior to January 1999 and will retune the Mark IVB receivers.</p>
<p><b>Primary Sites Affected and Assessment of Impact</b></p>
<p>Seven Air Force Mark IVB Meteorological Satellite Ground Terminals will
      need to be retuned to comply with the reallocation plan. The congestion of
      MetSat and radiosonde systems in the remainder of the band is expected to
      result in increased numbers of interference incidents and increased costs
      in radiosonde design.</p>
<p><b>Summary of Expected Conditions and Cost Drivers for 1670-1675 MHz</b></p>
<p>The requirement to operate radiosondes and Mark IVB terminals will
      continue, but these systems will be accommodated in the remainder of the
      1675-1700 MHz band. Table 12 summarizes the expected conditions and cost
      drivers for the low and high reallocation cost estimates for the 1670-1675

<h1><a name="1710-1755">1710-1755 MHz</a></h1>
<h3>Overview of 1710-1755 MHz</h3>
<p>This band is used by the military for fixed, point-to-point
      communications and weapons command and control. Additional limited use is
      for ATC.</p>
<p>The low cost estimate for reallocation of this band is $31.32M and is
      based on re-engineering and modifying systems to operate in adjacent parts
      of the spectrum.</p>
<p>The high cost estimate for reallocation of this band is $131.32M and is
      based on re-engineering and modifying systems to operate in adjacent parts
      of the spectrum, and retuning weapon command and control links.</p>
<p>Although many of the tactical communications systems in this band can
      tune throughout the 1350-1850 MHz band, this 10 percent loss of spectrum
      is significant because it further compresses the authorized segments
      available for use in the US, and exacerbates the already difficult task of
      determining interference free frequency assignments. Significant costs
      will be incurred to re-engineer and modify other systems that presently
      use this spectrum.</p>
<h3>OBRA-93 Summary for 1710-1755 MHz</h3>
<p>NTIA identified the 1710-1755 MHz band for reallocation on a Mixed,
      Federal/non-Federal use basis beginning in January 2004. Recognizing the
      need for spectrum by non-Federal users, NTIA allowed for reallocation of
      this spectrum beginning January 1999 for the twenty-five largest US cities
      (see Table 13), provided that</p>
<p>· Reimbursement is provided to the affected Federal agencies</p>
<p>· Appropriate Federal Agency acquisition procedures are implemented
      to support moving the Federal systems to another band, and</p>
<p>· Suitable and sufficient radio spectrum is available for the move</p>
<p>Federal Power Agency (FPA) microwave communication systems, and stations
      used for limited times during emergency and disaster response, are
      exempted from reallocation and will continue operation and be protected
      from interference. In addition, Federal operations that provide
      safety-of-life and other critical functions, and are located outside the
      twenty-five largest US cities, are also exempted from reallocation and
      will continue operation and be protected from interference.</p>

<h3>Major Functions and Missions</h3>
<p>This band is used by the Army Corp of Engineers (ACE) for fixed,
      point-to-point microwave radio for backbone communications in the
      Continental US Engineer Districts to support functions similar to those of
      the protected FPA. The Army also uses the band to support mobile, tactical
      radio relay proficiency training activities. Air Force communications
      links in this band include provisions for connectivity between gap-filler
      radar sites, medical facilities, test and training areas, and encrypted
      command and control between headquarters and wing commanders. An ATC
      system at Hill AFB and command and control links for Tethered Aerostat
      Radar Systems (TARS) would also be impacted. The band is also used for
      missile weapons systems to provide radiolocation, radionavigation, and
      guidance.</p>

<h3>Assumptions and Cost Drivers</h3>
<p><b>ACE.</b> The Army suggested that the Corp of Engineers be afforded
      power agency protection and that their assignments not be modified, since
      the functions they perform are similar to those of the protected FPAs. If
      such protection is not adopted, the cost to re-crystal and realign
      approximately 260 sites to operate in the remaining 1755-1850 MHz is
      estimated at $23M. </p>
<p><b>Tactical Radio Relay.</b> Lightweight, transportable equipment is a
      fundamental requirement for the dynamic battlefield environment facing the
      Army. They use the 1710-1750 MHz band extensively for headquarters nodal
      connectivity within their area-wide integrated communications networks.
      This equipment is transportable to support a fast moving network and
      flexible to the tactical tempo and operating conditions. The transmitter
      power, propagation characteristics, available bandwidth, and other 
      physical and technical factors make this the ideal band to support such
      operations. The option of tuning to another part of the band is an
      undesirable one due to existing congestion. Although these systems can
      tune throughout the 1350-1850 MHz band, this 10 percent loss is
      significant because it further compresses the authorized segments
      available for use and exacerbates the already difficult task of
      determining interference free tactical frequency assignments.</p>
<p><b>TARS.</b> The Aerostats can be tuned to another part of the
      1755-1850 MHz band.</p>
<p><b>Hill AFB ATC.</b> The ATC system at Hill AFB can be retuned to
      another part of the 1755-1850 MHz frequency band at an estimated cost of
      $20,000.</p>
<p><b>Microwave Communication Links.</b> Air Force gap-filler radar,
      command and control, and other point-to-point microwave links can be
      re-engineered to operate in another frequency band at an estimated cost of
      $8.3M.</p>
<p><b>Guided Weapon Missile Systems.</b> Reallocation of this band could
      reduce the anti-jamming capability of these systems by approximately 40
      percent, rendering the guidance links useless in the presence of jamming.
      Re-engineering and modifications of the approximately 1,000 units would be
      required at an estimated cost of $100M.</p>
<p><b>Operational Impacts and Assessment of Impact</b></p>
<p>Army tactical communications (MSE/TRITAC) links will suffer the greatest
      impacts from this reallocation. Assigning frequencies for tactical
      operations will become more difficult, making it likely that interference
      will adversely impact certain operations. The larger an operation becomes,
      the more likely it is that interference will create problems.</p>
<p>The other systems listed can largely be accommodated in other bands or
      parts of the 1755-1850 MHz band, but will incur re-engineering and
      modification costs to implement the changes in frequency.</p>
<p><b>Primary Sites Affected and Assessment of Impact</b></p>
<p>In an effort to minimize the impacts due to the reallocation of the
      1710-1755 MHz band, fixed microwave, tactical radio relay, and
      aeronautical mobile operations will continue indefinitely at the locations
      and within the operating areas shown in Table 16. </p>
<p><b>Summary of Expected Conditions and Cost Drivers for 1710-1755 MHz</b></p>
<p>Table 17 summarizes the expected conditions and cost drivers for the low
      and high reallocation cost estimates for the 1710-1755 MHz band.</p>

<h1><a name="2300-2310">2300-2310 MHz</a></h1>
<h3>Overview of 2300-2310 MHz</h3>
<p>This band was formerly used by the military for radar target scatter and
      identification systems, and threat simulators and test equipment at
      various test and training ranges throughout the US. The military has
      implemented the scheduled reallocation of the 2300-2310 MHz band by
      restricting the use of the band to coordinated operations at selected test
      ranges and by discontinuing use of the band at other sites. No cost impact
      has been incurred.</p>
<h3>OBRA-93 Summary for 2300-2310 MHz</h3>
<p>NTIA identified the 2300-2310 MHz band for reallocation on an Exclusive,
      non-Federal use basis beginning in August 1995, with the following
      constraints</p>
<p>· Protection must be provided for critical, highly-sensitive deep
      space communications and interplanetary research radar operations in
      adjacent bands (thus, reallocation for airborne or space-to-earth links
      must be avoided)</p>
<p>· Commercial applications will be limited to less than 1 watt of
      power in this band</p>
<p>· Unwanted emission levels of commercial applications on any
      frequency below 2300 MHz must be below a specified level</p>
<p>· Operation of commercial devices in the 2300-2310 MHz band will
      not be permitted at Fort Irwin, CA</p>
<h3>Major Functions and Missions</h3>
<p>Military use of the 2300-2310 MHz band consists primarily of radar
      target scatter and identification systems and threat simulators and test
      equipment used in specialized electronic warfare training exercises.</p>

<h3>Assumptions and Cost Drivers</h3>
<p>The systems that operate in this band are tunable over a wide range of
      frequencies and, consequently, will not incur any measurable cost impact
      due to the reallocation of this band.</p>
<p><b>Operational Impacts and Assessment of Impact</b></p>
<p>The electronic warfare (EW) systems operating in this band have unique
      frequency requirements. DoD’s greatest concern regarding this band is
      the potential inability to perform realistic EW training. The loss of this
      ability would reduce the probability of survival for military personnel in
      hostile situations.</p>
<p><b>Primary Sites Affected and Assessment of Impact</b></p>
<p>The specialized training conducted in this band is done at training
      ranges that are frequently located in areas remote from the general
      public.</p>
<h1><a name="2390-2450">2390-2450 MHz</a></h1>
<p><b>(2390-2400 MHz, 2400-2402 MHz, 2402-2417 MHz, and 2417-2450 MHz)</b></p>
<h3>Overview of 2390-2450 MHz</h3>
<p>These bands were used by the military for telemetry, radar target
      scattering, and EW training at various test and training ranges
      nationwide. While some of the systems have wide tuning ranges and were
      able to accommodate the reallocation by locking out the appropriate
      frequency bands, others required re-engineering and modification.
      Estimated reallocation costs were $39.1M.</p>
<h3>OBRA-93 Summary for 2390-2450 MHz</h3>
<p>NTIA identified 2390-2417 MHz for reallocation on an Exclusive,
      non-Federal use basis, and identified the 2417-2450 MHz band for
      reallocation on a Mixed, Federal/non-Federal use basis. Reallocation of
      the 2390-2400 MHz and 2402-2417 MHz bands was immediate, and reallocation
      of the 2400-2402 MHz and 2417-2450 MHz bands became effective in August
      1995.</p>
<h3>Major Functions and Missions</h3>
<p>Military uses of the 2390-2450 MHz band included range telemetry and
      measuring systems, target identification, radar target scattering
      measurements, and threat simulation radars. The majority of this use was
      focused below 2400 MHz.</p>

<h3>Assumptions and Cost Drivers</h3>
<p><b>MPS-38, DSQ-50, CTS-515.</b> These systems are capable of tuning
      over a wide frequency band. The reallocation has been accommodated by
      restricting the equipment tuning range.</p>
<p><b>APR-9B.</b> No modifications to this electronic warfare receiver
      were required to accommodate the reallocation. </p>
<p><b>Telemetry Test Equipment.</b> Ground based telemetry systems are
      capable of being tuned. Flexibility in airborne systems is limited,
      however, and requires redesign or re-crystallizing for most units. The
      conversion of telemetry receivers and auto-tracking antenna systems was
      estimated at $2.5M. The modification and/or replacement of other telemetry
      test equipment was estimated at $600K for each Range Data system and at
      $650K for each Range Timing system.</p>
<p><b>URQ-30, 38 (CIRIS).</b> The Completely Integrated Reference
      Instrumentation System (CIRIS) was used by DoD to certify navigation
      systems and was the only source of continuous time, space and position
      information (TSPI) for DoD test programs. CIRIS operated on fixed tuned
      frequencies of 2412.4 MHz (interrogator) and 2347.2 MHz (transponder).
      Reallocation of the 2402-2417 MHz band on an Exclusive basis was projected
      to impact the interrogator at estimated costs of $125K for FY94, $450K for
      FY95, $10M for FY96, $14M for FY97, and $11M for FY98.</p>
<p><b>MST-T1A</b>. Modifications to electronic warfare equipment to
      lock-out the reallocated band segments were estimated at $1M for changes
      to system software.</p>
<p><b>Operational Impacts and Assessment of Impact</b></p>
<p>The systems that operate in this band generally have wide tuning ranges
      that can accommodate the reallocation. The operational impacts of this
      reallocation are difficult to quantify, but the inability to conduct
      special research projects does ultimately impact advances in science and
      technology for both the Federal and non-Federal sectors.</p>

<h1><a name="3650-3700">3650-3700 MHz</a></h1>
<h3>Overview of 3650-3700 MHz</h3>
<p>The primary military system of concern in this band is the Navy’s
      aircraft carrier ATC radar. Additional uses include Air Force and Army
      electronic countermeasures (ECM) training and advanced development
      research for hypersonic air vehicles. Reallocation of the band on a Mixed
      use basis and protection of essential radar operations at three sites will
      minimize the impact on military systems. The cost impact of this
      reallocation for analytical, training, and documentation is estimated at
      over $100K.</p>
<h3>OBRA-93 Summary for 3650-3700 MHz</h3>
<p>NTIA identified the 3600-3650 MHz band for reallocation on a Mixed,
      Federal/non-Federal use basis beginning in January 1999. It was noted that
      adopting adequate regulatory or industry receiver standards for new
      non-Federal systems operating in this band is essential to assuring
      satisfactory performance of those systems in bands adjacent to Federal
      high-power radars. (5) Protected military radar operations will continue
      indefinitely at the three sites listed in Table 23.</p>

<h3>Assumptions and Cost Drivers</h3>
<p><b>AN/SPN-43.</b> The forty-five AN/SPN-43 radars presently in
      operation tune from 3590-3700 MHz and have an operational life that
      extends to at least 2010. Redesigning the system’s channelization
      plan and implementing appropriate frequency management procedures for
      operations within 200 miles of the coast will be necessary.</p>
<p><b>AN/SPN-6.</b> The AN/SPN-6 is scheduled to be replaced by the
      AN/SPN-43 and will therefore not be impacted by the reallocation.</p>
<p><b>AN/SPQ-11.</b> The reallocation will be accommodated with the
      AN/SPQ-11 by restricting its tuning range. No costs will be incurred by
      implementing the restrictions. </p>
<p><b>Intercept Receivers.</b> The reallocation will have minimal impact
      on these systems and no costs will be incurred.</p>
<p><b>ECM Training Systems.</b> These systems are crucial to maintaining
      the combat readiness of our pilots; however, the reallocation will be
      accommodated by restricting the tuning range of appropriate ECM devices.
      It is estimated that the cost of studies to ensure the compatibility of
      these systems in the remaining spectrum is $100K.</p>
<p><b>HySTP.</b> The Hypersonic System Technology Program uses this band
      to telemeter data from experimental vehicles and to track the vehicles
      with radar. The program expects to suffer adverse impacts in terms of the
      ability to acquire data, but plans to restrict equipment from tuning in
      the reallocated band. No costs are expected to result from the
      restrictions.</p>
<p><b>Operational Impacts and Assessment of Impact</b></p>
<p><b>Navy Shipboard Radars</b>. Reallocation of the band on a Mixed use
      basis eliminates concern over possibly needing to replace the AN/SPN-43
      radar. However, detailed engineering analysis of the radar channeling
      plan, new operating procedures for coastal waters, and training and
      documentation/logistics procedures are required to implement the
      reallocation. Little or no operational impact is anticipated for carrier
      take off and landing proficiency training for pilots and radar operators.
      Protecting radar operations at the sites listed in Table 23 helps minimize
      impacts.</p>
<p><b>ECM Training / HySTP</b>. Testing and electronic warfare training
      activities will suffer some adverse impact due to the loss of tuning range
      but will implement operational work arounds to accommodate the
      reallocation.</p>
<p><b>Primary Sites Affected and Assessment of Impact</b></p>
<p>In order to protect essential radar operations, use of the band will be
      continued indefinitely at the sites listed in Table 23. ECM training and
      HySTP testing could be scheduled at major test and training ranges
      throughout the country.</p>

      and high reallocation cost estimates for the 3650-3700 MHz band.</p>

<h3>Assumptions and Cost Drivers</h3>
<p><b>Tactical Radio Relay.</b> The estimated cost of retuning and
      replacing these systems is $3.65M.</p>
<p><b>UAV Data Links.</b> The Army operates an UAV system at the National
      Training Center in Ft Irwin, CA. Preliminary cost estimates of the impact
      to this system are in excess of $10M.</p>
<p><b>AAW &amp; Ship Defense Links.</b> The next generation wide band
      anti-air warfare and ship defense system is being developed to operate in
      these and adjacent bands. Reallocation options, transition plans, and
      specific reallocation cost estimates for these systems were not available.
      However, a significant amount has been spent for the research, design, and
      early development of this defense system.</p>
<p><b>Operational Impacts and Assessment of Impact</b></p>
<p>The tactical radio relay systems that operate in this band are used by
      both the Army and Air Force to conduct point-to-point and troposcatter
      communications for comprehensive, realistic training, humanitarian relief,
      natural disaster operations, and to maintain combat readiness. The reasons
      for not tuning these systems in other frequency bands include the existing
      congestion in those bands and various technical issues. In essence, the
      technical issues are (1) that moving to a lower frequency band limits the
      available information bandwidth and results communications delays and (2)
      the physics of propagation associated with moving to a higher band limits
      link distances and increases set-up and alignment times. Neither of these
      encumbrances is tolerable in today’s rapid-tempo, highly mobile
      battlefield. The Army and Air Force have accommodated the reallocations by
      restricting the tuning range of their tactical radio relay systems and are
      attempting to address the adverse impacts through advanced frequency
      management techniques and other operational control measures.</p>
<p>It is unlikely that the reallocation will have any impact on the Navy
      AAW/Ship Defense links during 'blue water' operations conducted well away
      from the coast. However, the increasing requirement to train for and
      conduct littoral exercises increases the concern that interference may
      result from this adjacent band system.</p>
<h3>Primary Sites Affected</h3>
<p>The Army UAV system is operated at the National Training Center at Ft
      Irwin, CA. Tactical communications systems are operated nation-wide. Navy
      shipboard systems are operated in various test/training areas along US
      coastlines.</p>
