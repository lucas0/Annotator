We want our policies to be based on feedback from community representatives and a broad spectrum of the people who use our service, and we want to learn from and incorporate the advice of experts.  \n          Engagement makes our Community Standards stronger and more inclusive. It brings our stakeholders more fully into the policy development process, introduces us to new perspectives, allows us to share our thinking on policy options, and roots our policies in sources of knowledge and experience that go beyond Facebook.  \n          Product Policy is the team that writes the rules for what people are allowed to share on Facebook, including the Community Standards. To open up the policy development process and gather outside views on our policies, we created the Stakeholder Engagement team, a sub-team that\u2019s part of Product Policy. Stakeholder Engagement's main goal is to ensure that our policy development process is informed by the views of outside experts and the people who use Facebook. We have developed specific practices and a structure for engagement in the context of the Community Standards, and we\u2019re expanding our work to cover additional policies, particularly ads policies and major News Feed ranking changes.  \n       In this post, we provide an overview of how stakeholder engagement contributes to the Community Standards. While Facebook is of course responsible for the substance of its policies, engagement helps us improve those policies and deepen important stakeholder relationships in ways we\u2019ll explain. To benchmark our work and help us incorporate best practices in this area, we retained non-profit organization BSR (Business for Social Responsibility). BSR conducted an analysis that has informed our perspective on engagement, and that we\u2019ve used in preparing this post. \n       \n      \n      \n       WHO ARE OUR STAKEHOLDERS? \n       By \u201cstakeholders\u201d we mean all organizations and individuals who are impacted by, and therefore have a stake in, Facebook\u2019s Community Standards. Because the Community Standards apply to every post, photo, and video shared on Facebook, this means that our more than 2.7 billion users are, in a broad sense, stakeholders.  \n       But we can\u2019t meaningfully engage with that many people. So it\u2019s also useful to think of stakeholders as those who are informed about and able to speak on behalf of others. This is why the primary focus of our engagement is civil society organizations, activist groups, and thought leaders, in such areas as digital and civil rights, anti-discrimination, free speech, and human rights. We also engage with academics who have relevant expertise. Academics may not directly represent the interests of others, but they are important stakeholders by virtue of their extensive knowledge, which helps us create better policies for everyone. \n      \n      \n       HOW DO WE INCORPORATE STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT INTO OUR POLICY DEVELOPMENT PROCESS? \n       Integrating stakeholder feedback into the policy-making process is a core part of how we work. Though it's important that we not over-promise, we know that what stakeholders seek above all is for their insights to inform our policy decisions.  \n        There are many reasons why we may draft a new policy or revise an existing one. We continuously build our policies to meet the needs of our community. Sometimes external stakeholders tell us that a particular policy fails to address an issue that\u2019s important to them. In other cases, the press draws attention to a policy gap. Often, members of Facebook\u2019s Community Operations team (whose employees, contractors, and out-sourcing partners are responsible for enforcing the Community Standards) tell us about trends or the need for policy clarification. And Facebook\u2019s Research teams (both within Product Policy and in other parts of the company) may point us to data or user sentiment that seems best addressed through policy-making. \n        In considering a new policy, Product Policy runs a series of internal working groups, leading up to a cross-team meeting we call the Product Policy Forum (previously referred to as the Content Standards Forum). We\u2019ve explained the Content Standards Forum in detail  here . \n        At the outset, the Stakeholder Engagement team frames up policy questions requiring feedback and determines what types of stakeholders to prioritize for engagement. We then reach out to external stakeholders, gathering feedback that we document and synthesize for our colleagues.  \n        Our engagement on the Community Standards takes many forms. The heart of our approach to engagement is private conversations, most often in person or by video-conference. We\u2019ve found that this approach lends itself to candid dialogue and relationship-building. We typically don't release the names of those we engage with because conversations can be sensitive and we want to ensure open lines of communication. Some stakeholders may also request or require confidentiality, particularly if media attention is unwanted or if they are members of a vulnerable community. \n        In addition, we sometimes convene group discussions, bringing together stakeholders in particular regions or specific policy areas. We\u2019ve found the group setting to be useful for generating ideas and providing updates to multiple stakeholders. And on occasion it also makes sense to reach out to relevant Facebook users to get their views. Recently, for example, we reviewed the \u201cexclusion\u201d element of our hate speech policy. As part of this process, we talked to the admins from a number of major Facebook Groups (admins are responsible for managing Group settings), who shared their insights with us relating to this policy. We'll do more of this user outreach in the future.  \n        In our conversations with external stakeholders, we share Facebook's thinking on the proposed policy change, including what led us to reconsider this policy, and the pros and cons of policy options we've identified. The feedback we receive is fed into the process and shapes our ongoing deliberations by highlighting new perspectives and helping us evaluate our options. When stakeholder views conflict, we analyze the spectrum of opinion and points of disagreement. We want to identify which views are most persuasive and instructive for us, but we\u2019re not necessarily trying to reconcile them; rather, our goal is to understand the full range of opinion concerning the proposal. In some cases we return to stakeholders for additional input as our thinking develops.  \n       At the Product Policy Forum, the Stakeholder Engagement team presents a detailed summary of the feedback we've received on each policy proposal, and we lay out the views of our stakeholders on a spectrum of policy options. This summary is made public (minus the names of individual stakeholders and organizations) in our published  minutes  of the meeting. In this way, anyone can see the range and nature of engagement we\u2019ve conducted for policy proposals, and the rationale for our final decision. After policy development is complete, we inform our stakeholders what we\u2019ve decided. \n      \n      \n      \n       WHAT PRINCIPLES GUIDE OUR ENGAGEMENT? \n       A commitment to stakeholder engagement means addressing a number of essential questions \u2014 such as, how do we decide which groups and individuals to talk to, how do we make sure that vulnerable groups are heard, and how do we find relevant experts? \n       Our policies involve a complex balancing of values such as safety, voice, and equity. There\u2019s no simple formula for how engagement contributes to this work. But over the past year we\u2019ve developed a structure and methodology for engagement on our Community Standards, built around three core principles: \n      \n       Inclusiveness \n       Engagement broadens our perspective and creates a more inclusive approach to policy-making. \n      \n        Engagement helps us better understand how our policies impact those who use our service. When we make decisions about what content to remove and what to leave up, we affect people's speech and the way they connect on Facebook. Not everyone will agree on where we draw the lines, but at a minimum, we need to understand the concerns of those who are affected by our policies. This is particularly important for stakeholders whose voices have been marginalized. \n       Understanding how our policies affect the people who use Facebook presents a major challenge. Our scale makes it impossible to speak directly to the more than 2.7 billion people who use our platform. This dilemma also underscores the importance of reaching out to a broad spectrum of stakeholders in all regions so that our policy-making process is globally diverse. \n        The question of our impact plays out in many ways. Our policies are global (the Internet is borderless, and our mission is to build community), but we touch people's lives on a very local level. We are often asked, \u201cWhy should  you  be creating policies to govern online speech for  me ?\u201d Typically embedded in this question is a demand that we show more cultural sensitivity and understanding of regional context.  \n        Stakeholder engagement gives us a tool to deepen our local knowledge and perspective \u2013 so we can hear voices we might otherwise miss. For each policy proposal, we identify a global and diverse set of stakeholders on the issue. We seek voices across the policy spectrum, but it\u2019s not always self-evident what the spectrum is. In many cases, our policies don't line up neatly with traditional dichotomies, such as liberal versus conservative, or civil libertarian versus law enforcement. We talk to others in Facebook's Policy and Research organizations and conduct our own research to identify a range of diverse stakeholders. \n        For example, in considering how our hate speech policy should apply to certain forms of gendered language, we spoke with academic experts, women's and digital rights groups, and free speech advocates. Likewise, when considering our policy on nudity and sexual activity in art, we listened to family safety organizations, artists, and museum curators. In reviewing how our policies should apply to memorialized profiles of deceased users, we connected both with professors who study digital legacy as an academic subject and Facebook users who've been designated as \u201cLegacy Contacts\u201d and who have real world experience with this product feature. \n       It's not enough to ask how our policies affect users in general. We need to understand how our policies will impact people who are particularly vulnerable by virtue of laws, cultural practices, poverty, or other reasons that prevent them from speaking up for their rights. In our stakeholder mapping, we seek to put an emphasis on minority groups that have traditionally lacked power, such as political dissidents and religious minorities throughout the world. In reevaluating how our hate speech policy applies to certain behavioral generalizations, for example, we consulted with immigrants rights groups. Our efforts are a work in progress, but we are committed to bringing these voices into our policy discussions. \n      \n       Expertise       \n       Engagement brings expertise to our policy development process. \n        The Stakeholder Engagement team conducts detailed, iterative research to identify top subject matter experts in civil society and academia. It then gathers their views to inform our policy decisions.  \n       This engagement ensures that our policy-making process is informed by current theories and analysis, empirical research, and an understanding of the latest online trends. The expertise we gather includes issues of language, social identity, and geography, all of which bear on our policies in important ways.  \n       Facebook\u2019s policies are entwined with many complex social and technological issues, such as hate speech, terrorism, bullying and harassment, and threats of violence. Sometimes we're looking for guidance on how safety and voice should be balanced \u2014 for example, in considering what types of speech to allow about \u201cpublic figures\u201d under our policies. In other cases, we're reaching out to gain specialized knowledge, such as how our policies can draw on international human rights principles, or how minority communities may experience certain types of speech. \n        We don\u2019t have all the answers to address these problems on our platform. Sometimes the challenges we face are novel even to the experts we consult with. But by talking to outside experts and incorporating their feedback, we make our policies more thoughtful. \n       For example, over the past year and a half we've modified our  hate speech policy  to recognize three tiers of attacks. Tier 1, the most severe, involves calls to violence or dehumanizing speech against other people based on their race, ethnicity, nationality, gender or other protected characteristic (\u201cKill the Christians\u201d). Tier 2 attacks consist of statements of inferiority or expressions of contempt or disgust (\u201cMexicans are lazy\u201d). And Tier 3 covers calls to exclude or segregate (\u201cNo women allowed\u201d).  \n        Developing these tiers has made our policies more nuanced and precise. On the basis of the tiers, we're able to provide additional protections against the most harmful forms of speech. For instance, we now remove Tier 1 hate speech directed against immigrants (\u201cimmigrants are rats\u201d) but permit less intense forms of speech (\u201cimmigrants should stay out of our country\u201d) to leave room for broad political discourse.  \n        As part of our work we spoke to outside experts \u2014 academics, NGOs that study hate speech, and groups all across the political landscape. This engagement helped confirm that the tiers were comprehensive and aligned with patterns of online and offline behavior. We\u2019ll continue to consider adjustments to our policies in light of opinions from experts and civil society. \n      \n       Transparency       \n       Engagement makes our policies and our policy development process more transparent. \n       Given the impact of our Community Standards on society, it\u2019s critical for us to create a policy development process that\u2019s not only inclusive and based on expert knowledge, but also transparent. We know from talking to hundreds of stakeholders that opening up our policy-making process helps build trust. The more visibility we provide, the more our stakeholders are likely to view the Community Standards as relevant, legitimate, and based on consent.  \n       When we engage, we share details about the challenges of moderating content for 2.7 billion people and we explain the rationale behind our policies and why there may be a need for improvement. We gather stakeholder feedback so we can develop creative policy solutions to these problems. The policies we launch based on this process are still owned by Facebook, but they are stronger by virtue of having been tested through consultation and an exchange of views.  \n        It\u2019s important to acknowledge that our policies will never make everyone happy. Nudity, say, is viewed quite differently in Scandinavia and Southeast Asia, and no Facebook policy on nudity would be equally satisfactory to both. Our job as a team is to craft thoughtful global policies, knowing that our work will be criticized by some.   \n       Transparency on our process of engagement also helps us build a system of rules and enforcement that people regard as fair. We know that some people would like us to go further and disclose the names of our stakeholders and even the substance of our discussions with them. For reasons discussed above, we\u2019ve chosen not to go this route, at least for now. We'll continue to experiment with ways of being more public about engagement where we have the prior agreement of our stakeholders. \n      \n      \n     THE WAY FORWARD \n       As the breadth and specialization of our policies increase, so too will the scope of our engagement. We\u2019ll continue to refine our policy development process and work to realize our stakeholder engagement principles of inclusiveness, expertise, and transparency. We expect our team to grow, and our reach to expand.  \n       With BSR\u2019s help, we\u2019re also working on specific ways to improve.  \n       For example, we'll continue to develop means to engage with new stakeholders around the world and will seek guidance from regional experts about how to do so most effectively. We\u2019ve also had requests to explore channels like informal roundtables and recurring video-conference meetings as a way of staying in touch with stakeholders on specific policy issues. These settings provide continuity and enable us to involve stakeholders even more closely in the design of specific policies and products. \n       As we expand the scope of our outreach, we also want to investigate whether we might be able to create other mechanisms for users to give us feedback on our policies. For example, as part of the effort to gather global feedback on the Oversight Board, Facebook created a  public consultation process  containing both a questionnaire and free-form questions. Through this tool, users were able to submit their views on the Board directly to Facebook. One could imagine a similar process whereby NGOs and civil society organizations could join our network of contacts in order to receive regular policy updates and provide feedback to members of our team.   \n       These are all exciting challenges, and we look forward to working with our stakeholders to improve the level of our engagement and its contribution to the development of our policies. \n      \n     \n   \n ","policy_rationale":null}},"rawIntroContent":"\n   \n    Every day, people come to Facebook to share their stories, see the world through the eyes of others, and connect with friends and causes. The conversations that happen on Facebook reflect the diversity of a community of more than two billion people communicating across countries and cultures and in dozens of languages, posting everything from text to photos and videos. \n   We recognize how important it is for Facebook to be a place where people feel empowered to communicate, and we take our role in keeping abuse off our service seriously. That\u2019s why we have developed a set of Community Standards that outline what is and is not allowed on Facebook. Our Standards apply around the world to all types of content. They\u2019re designed to be comprehensive \u2013 for example, content that might not be considered hate speech may still be removed for violating our bullying policies. \n\n     The goal of our Community Standards is to  encourage expression and create a safe environment . We  develop our policies  based on input from our community and from experts in fields such as technology and public safety. Our policies are also rooted in the following principles: \n   \n      \n     Safety:  People need to feel safe in order to build community. We are committed to removing content that encourages real-world harm, including (but not limited to) physical, financial, and emotional injury. \n  \n        \n  \n Voice:  Our mission is all about embracing diverse views. We err on the side of allowing content, even when some find it objectionable, unless removing that content can prevent a specific harm. Moreover, at times we will allow content that might otherwise violate our standards if we feel that it is newsworthy, significant, or important to the public interest. We do this only after weighing the public interest value of the content against the risk of real-world harm. \n  \n    \n      \n Equity:  Our community is global and diverse. Our policies may seem broad, but that is because we apply them consistently and fairly to a community that transcends regions, cultures, and languages. As a result, our Community Standards can sometimes appear less nuanced than we would like, leading to an outcome that is at odds with their underlying purpose. For that reason, in some cases, and when we are provided with additional context, we make a decision based on the spirit, rather than the letter, of the policy.\n \n\n    \n     Everyone on Facebook plays a part in keeping the platform safe and respectful. We ask people to share responsibly and to let us know when they see something that may violate our Community Standards. We make it easy for people to report potentially violating content, including Pages, Groups, profiles, individual content, and\/or comments to us for review. We also give people the option to  block ,  unfollow , or  hide  people and posts, so that they can control their own experience on Facebook. \n\n     The consequences for violating our Community Standards vary depending on the severity of the violation and a person's history on the platform. For instance, we may warn someone for a first violation, but if they continue to violate our policies, we may restrict their ability to post on Facebook or disable their profile. We also may notify law enforcement when we believe there is a genuine risk of physical harm or a direct threat to public safety.  \n\n     Our Community Standards, which we will continue to develop over time, serve as a guide for how to communicate on Facebook. It is in this spirit that we ask members of the Facebook community to follow these guidelines. \n    \n "},"dummyElem":{"__m":"__elem_fc9f538f_0_0"},"acrossTransitions":false,"clobberSiblings":false,"preloader":null}]],["VideosRenderingInstrumentation","storeRenderTime",["__elem_a648e52c_0_0"],[{"__m":"__elem_a648e52c_0_0"}]],["__inst_a648e52c_0_0"],["VideoDisplayTimePlayButton","register",["__elem_8937e029_0_0","__elem_0bcc40a7_0_0"],[{"__m":"__elem_8937e029_0_0"},{"__m":"__elem_0bcc40a7_0_0"}]],["__inst_3f1e98e4_0_0"],["__inst_0bcc40a7_0_0"],["__inst_ebb64f7c_0_0"],["__inst_98d9a45e_0_0"],["__inst_21a8c1d4_0_0"],["__inst_dbb8a0b1_0_0"],["__inst_74f26af1_0_0"],["__inst_6d29ee41_0_0"],["__inst_70dbca80_0_0"],["VideoDashPrefetchCache","loadVideo",[],[{"videoID":1415167278571737,"manifest":[],"video":[{"url":"https:\/\/video-dub4-1.xx.fbcdn.net\/v\/t42.1790-2\/18824400_1415174128571052_5055827053203423232_n.mp4?_nc_cat=1&efg=eyJ2ZW5jb2RlX3RhZyI6ImRhc2hfdjNfMTI4MF9jcmZfMjNfaGlnaF8zLjFfZnJhZ18yX3ZpZGVvIn0\u00253D&_nc_oc=AQmKfhTY82aufkHRGmjGuiL9AsinaWRsOjF4sSQkhkIFucfsRIWWnPTr6N1Aj8g76y0&_nc_ht=video-dub4-1.xx&oh=59b3b2248a4702692a83b6e21bf80183&oe=5D27A15A","start":0,"end":956,"segment_type":"init","mime_codec":"video\/mp4; codecs=\"avc1.64001f\"","representation_id":"1415174125237719v"},{"url":"https:\/\/video-dub4-1.xx.fbcdn.net\/v\/t42.1790-2\/18824400_1415174128571052_5055827053203423232_n.mp4?_nc_cat=1&efg=eyJ2ZW5jb2RlX3RhZyI6ImRhc2hfdjNfMTI4MF9jcmZfMjNfaGlnaF8zLjFfZnJhZ18yX3ZpZGVvIn0\u00253D&_nc_oc=AQmKfhTY82aufkHRGmjGuiL9AsinaWRsOjF4sSQkhkIFucfsRIWWnPTr6N1Aj8g76y0&_nc_ht=video-dub4-1.xx&oh=59b3b2248a4702692a83b6e21bf80183&oe=5D27A15A","start":957,"end":1600,"segment_type":"sidx","mime_codec":"video\/mp4; codecs=\"avc1.64001f\"","representation_id":"1415174125237719v"},{"url":"https:\/\/video-dub4-1.xx.fbcdn.net\/v\/t42.1790-2\/18824400_1415174128571052_5055827053203423232_n.mp4?_nc_cat=1&efg=eyJ2ZW5jb2RlX3RhZyI6ImRhc2hfdjNfMTI4MF9jcmZfMjNfaGlnaF8zLjFfZnJhZ18yX3ZpZGVvIn0\u00253D&_nc_oc=AQmKfhTY82aufkHRGmjGuiL9AsinaWRsOjF4sSQkhkIFucfsRIWWnPTr6N1Aj8g76y0&_nc_ht=video-dub4-1.xx&oh=59b3b2248a4702692a83b6e21bf80183&oe=5D27A15A","start":1601,"end":148838,"segment_type":"data","mime_codec":"video\/mp4; codecs=\"avc1.64001f\"","representation_id":"1415174125237719v"}],"audio":[{"url":"https:\/\/video-dub4-1.xx.fbcdn.net\/v\/t42.1790-2\/18884042_1415174195237712_1335503351793582080_n.mp4?_nc_cat=1&efg=eyJ2ZW5jb2RlX3RhZyI6ImRhc2hfdjNfNDI2X2NyZl8yM19tYWluXzMuMF9mcmFnXzJfYXVkaW8ifQ\u00253D\u00253D&_nc_oc=AQmreS86tpCQ5CkvVdOtFs15uyKmjgf4LQCmxPDlh6bq4VDOT8fmiriq7bmGzIgK2E4&_nc_ht=video-dub4-1.xx&oh=7ee90be3bf151452c65ef2e1c5187088&oe=5D27877E","start":0,"end":876,"segment_type":"init","mime_codec":"audio\/mp4; codecs=\"mp4a.40.29\"","representation_id":"1415174185237713ad"},{"url":"https:\/\/video-dub4-1.xx.fbcdn.net\/v\/t42.1790-2\/18884042_1415174195237712_1335503351793582080_n.mp4?_nc_cat=1&efg=eyJ2ZW5jb2RlX3RhZyI6ImRhc2hfdjNfNDI2X2NyZl8yM19tYWluXzMuMF9mcmFnXzJfYXVkaW8ifQ\u00253D\u00253D&_nc_oc=AQmreS86tpCQ5CkvVdOtFs15uyKmjgf4LQCmxPDlh6bq4VDOT8fmiriq7bmGzIgK2E4&_nc_ht=video-dub4-1.xx&oh=7ee90be3bf151452c65ef2e1c5187088&oe=5D27877E","start":877,"end":1532,"segment_type":"sidx","mime_codec":"audio\/mp4; codecs=\"mp4a.40.29\"","representation_id":"1415174185237713ad"},{"url":"https:\/\/video-dub4-1.xx.fbcdn.net\/v\/t42.1790-2\/18884042_1415174195237712_1335503351793582080_n.mp4?_nc_cat=1&efg=eyJ2ZW5jb2RlX3RhZyI6ImRhc2hfdjNfNDI2X2NyZl8yM19tYWluXzMuMF9mcmFnXzJfYXVkaW8ifQ\u00253D\u00253D&_nc_oc=AQmreS86tpCQ5CkvVdOtFs15uyKmjgf4LQCmxPDlh6bq4VDOT8fmiriq7bmGzIgK2E4&_nc_ht=video-dub4-1.xx&oh=7ee90be3bf151452c65ef2e1c5187088&oe=5D27877E","start":1533,"end":13753,"segment_type":"data","mime_codec":"audio\/mp4; codecs=\"mp4a.40.29\"","representation_id":"1415174185237713ad"}]},false,0.9]],["BladeRunnerClient"],["SkywalkerUtils"],["MqttLongPollingRunner"],["TimeSliceImpl"],["ServerJSDefine"],["InitialJSLoader"]],"contexts":[[{"__m":"__elem_a588f507_0_1"},true],[{"__m":"__elem_a588f507_0_2"},true]]});}, "ServerJS define", {"root":true})();</script>
