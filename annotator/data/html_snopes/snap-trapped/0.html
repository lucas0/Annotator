<center>
<p><img height="368" src="http://www.safespeed.org.uk/effects001.gif" width="557"/></p></center>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">There has been a very long established
beneficial trend in the UK fatal accident rate. It dropped from 94.46 fatals
per billion vehicle kilometres in 1950 to 9.25 fatals per billion vehicle
kilometres in 1993. Since 1993 that regular and reliable annual reduction
(equivalent to 5.26% per annum) has declined to <font color="#FFFFFF">near
zero. The red line on the grap</font>h (actual official road fatalities
for England and Wales) shows what has really happened. 2002 was the highest
figure (3,127) since 1997 (3,222) </font>
</p><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">From 1978 until 1993 the fatality rate
trend was better (equivalent to 6.81% per annum). The yellow dashed line
on the graph above shows how deaths would have fallen if this trend had
continued and is properly corrected for the negative effect of increased
traffic.</font>
</p><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">If speed cameras had shown a benefit we
would have expected to see a <b><i>larger</i></b> improvement in the fatality
rate. The blue line (also corrected for traffic volumes) shows an example
of what might have happened if cameras had saved lives.</font>
</p><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The green line shows actual official home
office convictions by speed camera from 1990 (0) through the first 290
speed camera convictions in 1992 through to an amazing 1,014,600 speed
camera convictions in 2001. Figures for 2002 are not yet available but
we expect more than 1.3 million to be announced shortly (shown dashed).</font>
</p><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">So it's clear that during the period of
speed camera growth the roads have not become safer. If speed cameras worked
and "some other factor" caused the loss of trend it would have to be absolutely
enormous to account for the difference between the blue line (possible
camera benefit) and the red (actual data).</font>

</tbody></table></center>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">So the real factor that we believe has
caused this deadly loss of trend was a change in road safety policy. In
1993 we launched speed cameras on the public and backed them with "speed
kills" and "slow down" messages. Since then it's been growing and growing.
This policy has had a range of knock on effects:</font>
</p><ul>
<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">The Police now leave much of their their job
on the roads to "PC Gatso".</font></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">Public fear of traffic (and especially "speeding
drivers") has increased considerably (this probably does provide a perverse
road safety benefit - but it must be swamped because it simply isn't there
in national figures for all road fatalities). We note that pedestrian deaths
on British roads are still falling (offset by rises elsewhere of course).
These saved lives may well be due to increasing pedestrian fear of traffic.
If they were due to drivers slowing, then we would have to expect other
groups to benefit, but this simply isn't happening.</font></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">Millions of responsible motorists began to
pay more attention to speed limit, speed enforcement and speedo reading.
Since they only have a finite amount of attention to give, this must mean
they they now pay less attention to "something else".  We are sure
that on a significant proportion of occasions that "something else" includes
much more immediate and vital safety factors - perhaps a dangerous situation
developing ahead.</font></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">Millions of different, (and less skilled)
motorists have received the message that keeping to the speed limit is
their primary duty to road safety. It's frightening to imagine a driver
steaming into danger at 29 mph convinced that his speed must be safe.</font></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">Responsibility for safe speed setting is being
removed from drivers. Instead they must drive to standard speeds posted
by local authorities and others. But responsibility is a core value of
safe driving. Erode drivers responsibilities and their performance in terms
of setting safe speeds and avoiding crashes is highly likely to worsen.</font></li>
</ul>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">There are other effects, (we maintain a list
(<a href="http://www.safespeed.org.uk/dangers.html">click here</a>)), but this group of five are probably
the most important.</font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">None of these effects have been the subject
of proper scientific research. Until they are we won't know for sure which
prove to be the most important on the road. But the 1993 shift in road
safety policy is the only factor we can identify which could reasonably
be blamed for the loss of trend in the fatal accident rate. It follows
that there would have to be a mechanism whereby such a policy change could
affect the fatality rate for the worse. These five factors offer just such
a mechanism, and they are all plausible.</font></p></td>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We've created an experimental model of
UK road safety. See (<a href="http://www.safespeed.org.uk/factors.html">factors</a>). In order to make
fatalities behave as they have done, "something" on the "input side" must
change - drastically - by about 6% for the worse in about 1993.</font>
</p><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We know that there are large and ongoing
safety benefits coming from vehicle safety improvements, road engineering
improvements (including especially black spot treatments and bypasses)
and we know that improvements in medical care improve the chances of survival
after a crash. These three factors together have always swamped the growth
in traffic to deliver much safer roads with large and regular improvements
in the fatality rate. But this does not happen any more.</font>
</p><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">What's the factor that got worse suddenly
in about 1993? It's drivers. We're not as good at avoiding big crashes
any more. We're being fed false safety messages and we're being distracted
from real road safety. Read on.</font></p></td>

Figure 15 in that document shows the number of times "excessive speed"
has been recorded as an accident causation factor by year since 1995. Over
that period there has been a massive growth in speed cameras, so we'd expect
to find fewer accidents caused by excessive speed in recent years. But
not one bit of it, in fact the opposite is true. As you can see in the

Sometimes an escaping criminal will risk his own life and other peoples'

all caution because of a serious personal problem. And sometimes young
nutters think they are driving gods and can get away with anything. People
in these groups may use very high speeds and may have terrible crashes.
But they won't respond to speed limit enforcement by camera - they have
other priorities and speeding tickets are not a consideration. Many truly
dangerous very high speed accidents come from this group.</font>
<br/> 
</p><p><b><i><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Method 2 - carelessness, inattention
or hazard perception failure - <font color="#FF6666">worse due to speed
kills policy</font></font></i></b>
</p><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The majority of excessive speed accidents
probably fall into this group. It's not so much a case of driving too fast
- more a case of failing to slow down when necessary. When we encounter
road hazards - and it happens many times during each drive - we normally
respond by reducing speed to negotiate the hazard safely. If we fail to
recognize the hazard (or recognize it late because we were inattentive)
we may not have enough time left to slow down to a safe speed. This sort
of accident is clearly a serious road safety issue, but we think more speed
enforcement will tend to make this sort of accident more common. The major
factor here is that these apparent excessive speed accidents actually spring
out of problems with driver attention. More speed enforcement is highly
likely to reduce average driver attention and exacerbate this group of
excessive speed accidents. </font>
<br/> 
</p><p><b><i><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Method 3 - judgement failure - <font color="#FF6666">some
worse,</font> <font color="#FF6666"> </font><font color="#66FF99">some
better</font><font color="#FFFFFF"> due to speed kills policy</font></font></i></b>
</p><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Think of someone that misjudges the severity
of a bend, enters it too fast and crashes. Since in most cases this sort
of misjudgement arises out of adjusted speed rather than free travelling
speed it's unlikely that speed enforcement could make much difference.
There might be a narrow range of hazards where the maximum safe speed is
around or just over the speed limit where enforcement might provide a benefit.
But the more we try to avoid drivers making this sort of judgement error,
the less practice they get, and the more useless they become. Call it the
nanny effect - too much protection makes us less able to ensure our own
safety. </font>
<br/> 
</p><p><b><i><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Method 4 - third party error + anticipation
failure - <font color="#66FF99">possibly better due to speed kills policy</font></font></i></b>
</p><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">This is where an "innocent" motorist driving
in excess of the speed limit is affected by someone else's error. Typically
it might be someone pulling out of a junction into the innocent motorist's
path. In most cases the innocent motorists' principle failure will have
been not anticipating the other road user's error. Yes, travelling at a
higher speed might make the accident worse. But habitually travelling at
a lower speed does tend to make one less attentive to these sorts of risk.
Of course this scenario overlaps with "Method 2" above. </font>
<br/> 
</p><p><b><i><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Method 5 - deliberately - no change
due to speed kills policy</font></i></b>
</p><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Assuming the objective is suicide or murder,
we don't suppose speed enforcement will be considered. </font>
<br/> 
</p><p><b><i><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Method 6 - mechanical failure - <font color="#66FF99">possibly
better due to speed kills policy</font></font></i></b>
</p><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">If you're going to have a blow out, then
lower speeds are better. But having a blow out is rare, and serious loss
of control following one is rarer still. Only a percent or two of all accidents
involve mechanical failure.</font>
<br/> 
</p><p><b><i><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Method 7 - "I wasn't going too fast
- I was within the speed limit" - <font color="#FF6666">worse due to speed
kills policy</font></font></i></b>
</p><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">We know full well that the road safety
message is supposed to be: "drive according to the conditions but always
within the speed limit." But it isn't always received properly. We reckon
that we now have millions of drivers who believe that their speed is safe
as long as they are not exceeding the speed limit. This misunderstood message
can easily cause excessive speed accidents.</font>
<br/> 
</p><p><b><i><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Section summary</font></i></b>
</p><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Excessive speed is found to be an accident
causation factor in less than 10% of accidents according to most studies
of real world accident causation. Within that 10% you can find all the
accident types listed above. Speed limits have no magic benefit. You can
be killed driving within the speed limit or as safe as houses above it.
A large proportion (working estimate: 2/3rds) of excessive speed accidents
take place entirely within the speed limit.</font>
</p><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">So lower speeds and speed kills policy
might have a positive influence on some of these sorts of accident. It's
interesting to note that those accident types which might be improved also
involve a clear and different driving error. Mechanical failure is the
exception, but is one of the least frequent accident causation factors.</font>
</p><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">But the largest share of excessive speed
accidents come from carelessness, inattention and hazard perception failures
- drivers failing to slow down when necessary. These accidents are likely
to be more frequent and more severe if we apply blanket speed enforcement.</font></p></td>

<p><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Distraction</font></b>
</p><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Accidents happen when people make mistakes.
About 75% of those mistakes are carelessness or inattention. About 5% of
those mistakes involve excessive speed. The big bother with too many speed
cameras is that they alter the things that drivers pay attention to. Too
many drivers now spend far too much time considering speed limit, speed,
speed limit compliance and the risk of enforcement. Sometimes - too often
- these days they are spending precious milliseconds worrying about numerical
speed while an unseen dangerous situation is developing ahead.</font>
</p><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Every year on our roads we have something
like 30 million near misses. If we distract our drivers we should not be
at all surprised that some of them are distracted at exactly the wrong
instant and something that would have been a near miss becomes a dangerous
accident.</font>
<br/> 
</p><p><b><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Attitude</font></b>
</p><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Driver attitude is well known to be related
to safety. Drivers with better attitudes leave better safety margins and
have fewer accidents. But too much speed enforcement promotes bad attitudes,
ranging from the careless: "it's not my fault I was only doing 30!" to
the angry: "you can't pass, I'm already doing the speed limit!" and the
frustrated: "let me past, you're only doing 40 mph and the limit's 60!" </font>
<br/> 
</p><p><b><i><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Responsibility</font></i></b>
</p><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The absolute cornerstone of earning the
safest roads in the World was individual driver responsibility. Speed enforcement
and an over reliance on speed limits shifts responsibility for speed setting
away from the driver. Such shifts erode one of the core principles of the
safety culture that made us so safe. </font>
<br/> 
</p><p><b><i><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Paranoia</font></i></b>
</p><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">These days I receive frequent emails from
drivers describing the experience of driving with 9 points on their licences.
They report that they are extremely tense when driving and spend a significant
proportion of their time looking at their speedometers. Are these people
better placed to avoid an accident? No, of course they are not - they are
under pressure and their performance is bound to suffer. But it isn't just
the nine pointers. Millions of safe and experienced drivers have a constant
low level fear of speed enforcement. It's not good and contributes to distraction
from safe driving tasks.</font>
<br/> 
</p><p><b><i><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Driver skill</font></i></b>
</p><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Make no mistake, speed enforcement is the
opposite of safe driving skills. It sends the clear message that drivers
are not to be trusted to set appropriate speeds. And it denies those who
are skilled enough to set high appropriate speeds in good conditions the
right to benefit from their skill. The more we emphasize tight controls
the less we encouraged safe skilled behaviours. It is wrongly assumed that
"we can afford to do without" drivers setting appropriate speed for the
conditions. </font>
<br/> 
</p><p><b><i><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Safety Priorities</font></i></b>
</p><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In those few seconds or few tenths of a
second before an accident is it more important that a driver should be
giving priority to what's going wrong ahead or to his speedometer? Since
every single accident and near miss is preceded by opportunities to avoid,
it should be obvious that the greatest safety priority should always be
accident avoidance. Reading the speedometer has no place in the drivers'
accident avoidance tool kit.</font>
<br/> 
</p><p><b><i><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Time to react</font></i></b>
</p><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">This is the single jewel in the rusty crown
of speed enforcement policy. If drivers are going more slowly when something
goes wrong, then they'll have more time to react and avoid or minimize
a collision. But this jewel turns out to be a nasty bit of broken glass.
Time to react is not usually delivered out of free travelling speed, but
from adjusted speed as a hazard is encountered. We saw more detail in <b><i>Method
2 - carelessness, inattention or hazard perception failure </i></b>above.</font>
<br/> 
</p><p><b><i><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Driver Concentration</font></i></b>
</p><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It is very well known amongst skilled and
advanced drivers that lower speeds demand lower attention, and that lower
speeds promote lower attention. If we slow down vehicles over a wide area,
particularly if we slow them significantly below the speeds that drivers
are currently choosing, we risk increasing accidents due to inattention,
poor concentration and sleepiness. Driver concentration is precious and
must be encouraged and promoted.</font>
<br/> 
</p><p><b><i><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Driver attention</font></i></b>
</p><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Tiny changes in average driver attention
can make accidents out of near misses. “Speed kills” road safety policy
is making quite large changes in the things that drivers pay attention
to. We should not be surprised that fear of speed enforcement is causing
lower average driver attention, nor that this dilution of attention increases
road dangers.</font></p></td>
