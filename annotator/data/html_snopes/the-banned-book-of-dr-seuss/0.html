<p align="center"><font color="#0000FF" size="2"><b><i>A Brief
Note:</i></b> </font></p>
<p><b>My wife stumbled across this book in an antique book shop
in the mountains. As a collector of Seussiana, I was very pleased
to find one I hadn't seen before. After reading it, I was
surprised that it was part of the Dr. Seuss library at all
because of the graphic elements of the story ... the use of
firearms, children being taken away, reference to suicide,
violence, etc. Not that I minded it, you see … I actually
liked it, and wondered why my parents never let me read it when I
was a child. But for whatever reason, the good people at the
Seuss Press decided to take this one and another book (</b><font color="#0000FF"><b><i>I Was Kissed By A Seal At The Zoo</i></b></font><b><i>
… God only knows what that one was about!</i></b><b>) out of
print. If you have any information on the above mentioned book,
please E-mail me, I'd love to hear about it! But here it is for
your enjoyment. Remember, you have been warned … </b></p>

<h3><font color="#FF0000" size="7">D</font>o you know what I'm
going to do next Saturday? </h3>
<h3>Well, sir .... let me tell you!</h3>
<h3>I'm going to do some things no one ever did before.</h3>
<h3><font color="#FF0000" size="7">F</font>irst of all, I'm going

<h3>No one can stop me.</h3>
<h3><font size="2">(Web author's note:<em>"Didn't Charles

<h3>And I want to.</h3>
<h3>I'm going to find someone to take me up in a jet.</h3>

<h3>Well, I'm going to next Saturday.</h3>
<h3>No kid in town ever did a thing like that before.</h3>
<h3>But I'll do more than that.</h3>
<h3>Did you ever go up in a heli ... heli ...</h3>
<h3>How do you say it?</h3>
<h3>Helicopter is how you say it.</h3>

<h3>I'll dump water on Sam.</h3>
<h3>I'll make him take a walk.</h3>
<h3>I'll make Sam walk about a hundred miles.</h3>
<h3>After a walk like that,</h3>
<h3>I'll have to eat a little something.</h3>
<h3>Sam won't keep going,</h3>
<h3>buy I want to keep going.</h3>
<h3>So I'll have to eat and eat.</h3>
<h3>Next Saturday I'm going to eat like a horse.</h3>
<h3>I'm going to jump more stumps than anyone ever jumped before.
</h3>
<h3>Everything I do will be fun!</h3>
<h3>Yes, everything!</h3>
<h3><font color="#FF0000" size="7">E</font>verything ...?</h3>
<h3>Well ... maybe not everything.</h3>
<h3>There is one thing I don't want to do next Saturday.</h3>
<h3>Mother told me I'll have to get my hair cut.</h3>
<h3><font color="#FF0000" size="7">A</font>ll right. </h3>
<h3>I'll go.</h3>
<h3>I'll go and look things over.</h3>
<h3>Oh! Oh!</h3>
<h3>Do I want to look like that next Saturday?</h3>
<h3>No, sir! No, sir!</h3>
<h3>Not next Saturday.</h3>
<h3>I'll get out of there fast,</h3>
<h3>and I'll take my hair with me.</h3>
<h3>No one is going to stop me next Saturday.</h3>
<h3><font color="#FF0000" size="7">T</font>here are things I want
to do.</h3>
<h3>Did you ever play </h3>

<h3><font color="#FF0000" size="7">S</font>hooting! </h3>
<h3>I'll go shooting with the United States Marines.</h3>
<h3>Little guns! Big guns!</h3>

<h3>And they are going to like me.</h3>
<h3><font color="#FF0000" size="7">T</font>hey will ask me to
stay</h3>

<h3>You have to keep eating if you want to keep going.</h3>
<h3>I'll stay with them.</h3>
<h3>I'll play with them.</h3>
<h3>I'll run with them.</h3>
<h3>I'll race with them.</h3>
<h3><font size="2">(Web author's note:<em>"Just when you
thought it couldn't get any stranger ...!"</em>)</font></h3>
<h3><font color="#FF0000" size="7">D</font>id you ever box a
United States Marine?</h3>
<h3>Well, sir, I'm going to box</h3>
<h3>a Marine next Saturday.</h3>
<h3>Then I'll box another way.</h3>
<h3>I'll box with sticks.</h3>
<h3>Two Marines at a time!</h3>
<h3>No kid ever, ever did</h3>

<h3>Next Saturday I'll yell my head off.</h3>
<h3>I'll blow horns. I'll blow and blow.</h3>
<h3><em><u>Next Saturday I'll blow my head off.</u></em></h3>
<h3>No one is going to stop me next Saturday.</h3>
<h3><font size="2">(Web author's note:<em>"At this point, I
had to stop reading, because of the suicidal implications the
previous passage was giving the youth of the time, and how it
would probably have a negative impact on fragile, developing
minds who would be reading it. But I shrugged it off and kept
reading."</em>)</font> </h3>
<h3><font color="#FF0000" size="7">T</font>hey will try to stop
me.</h3>
<h3>They may catch me.</h3>
<h3>They may take me away in a big tin can.</h3>
<h3>They may dump me over a wall.</h3>
<h3><em>But I'll pop up again.</em></h3>
<h3><font color="#FF0000" size="7">A</font>nd then do you know
what I'm going to do?</h3>
<h3>Well, sir, let me tell you ...</h3>
<h3>I'm going to eat more spaghetti </h3>
<h3>than any one ever ate before.</h3>
<h3>Did you ever eat a mile of spaghetti?</h3>
<h3>Did you ever eat two miles of spaghetti?</h3>
<h3>Well, sir,</h3>
<h3>I'm going to eat</h3>
<h3>TEN MILES OF SPAGHETTI.</h3>
<h3>No one ever did that before.</h3>
<h3>Not even a United States Marine!</h3>
<h3><font color="#FF0000" size="7">S</font>o ...</h3>
<h3>when the Marines hear about me and all that spaghetti,</h3>
<h3>do you know what they will do?</h3>
<h3>They will put on a parade.</h3>
<h3>A parade just for me!</h3>
<h3>And it will be ten miles long.</h3>
<h3>Just like the spaghetti.</h3>
<h3><font color="#FF0000" size="7">T</font>hen ... after the
parade,</h3>
<h3>I'll take them all home for supper.</h3>
<h3>I hope Mother has a little something</h3>
<h3>in the house for us to eat.</h3>
<h3><font color="#FF0000" size="7">Y</font>es, sir! </h3>
<h3>That is what I'm going to do next Saturday.</h3>
<h3>Saturday is going to be</h3>
