</p><p>Cohen Clair Lans Greifer &amp; Thorpe, LLP, New York, NY (Bernard E. Clair,
Michael Calogero, and Nancy E. Gianakos of counsel), for appellant.</p>
<p>Casey Greenfield, P.C., New York, NY (Nicholas Connell of counsel), for
respondent.</p>
<p>Barbara H. Kopman, Westbury, NY, attorney for the children.</p>
<p>Appeal from an order of the Supreme Court, Nassau County (Sondra K. Pardes, J.),
dated April 24, 2015. The order, after a hearing, granted the mother's motion to modify
the joint custody provisions of a judgment of divorce dated September 6, 2011, so as to
award her primary residential custody of the parties' children, and denied the father's
motion to modify the judgment of divorce so as to award him sole decision-making
authority with respect to the children.</p>
<p>Ordered that the order is affirmed, with costs.</p>
<p>The parties have two children, a daughter, born in March 1999, and a son, born in
September 2003. In a separation agreement dated April 2, 2010, which was incorporated
but not merged into the parties' judgment of divorce, the parties agreed to share
residential custody of the children on alternating weeks. Shortly after the divorce was
finalized, the mother moved to modify the joint custody provisions of the judgment of
divorce so as to award her sole custody, claiming that there had been a change in
circumstances. The Supreme Court denied the motion without a hearing. On appeal, this
Court found that the mother established that she was entitled to a hearing on her motion,
and remitted the matter to the Supreme Court for the appointment of an attorney for the
children and, thereafter, for a hearing and a new determination (<a href="http://www.nycourts.gov/../2013/2013_00053.htm" target="_blank"><i>see Anonymous 2011-1 v
Anonymous 2011-2</i>, 102 AD3d 640</a> [2013]).</p>
<p>While the hearing was underway, both parties filed emergency orders to show cause
based on circumstances that arose after the hearing had begun. In her motion, the mother
sought, inter alia, an award of temporary residential custody of the children. In his
motion, the father sought, inter alia, sole decision-making authority concerning the
children. Both parties and the attorney for the children asked for a forensic evaluation to
be performed.</p>
<p>On April 3, 2014, the Supreme Court ordered a forensic evaluation of the parties, the
children, and any necessary third parties, scheduled an in camera conference with the
children, and adjourned the hearing pending the conclusion of the forensic evaluation.
The court also took note of the fact that both parties now alleged "a dramatic change in
circumstance in their children's emotional and physical condition so as to warrant an
immediate change of custody, and/or parental <font color="FF0000">[*2]</font>decision making." Based on the parties' affidavits, the court
held, in effect, "that there has been a sufficient change in circumstances to warrant a
determination as to whether modifying the provisions of the agreement is in the best
interests of the children." Neither party challenges the Supreme Court's finding of
changed circumstances.</p>
<p>After the hearing was concluded, in the order appealed from, the Supreme Court
awarded the mother primary residential custody of the children. The court awarded the
father visitation with the children on alternating weekends and, in the weeks preceding
the mother's weekends, visitation with the son from Wednesday until Friday, and directed
that the daughter would have "the option to spend either Wednesday night or Thursday
night, or both, at the father's home." The court further directed that the parties were to
continue to have joint legal custody and joint decision-making authority. The father
appeals, contending, inter alia, that the Supreme Court erred in modifying the judgment
of divorce so as to award the mother primary residential custody, and in denying his
motion for an award of sole decision-making authority with respect to the children.</p>
<p>In determining whether a custody agreement that was incorporated into a judgment
of divorce should be modified, the paramount issue before the court is whether, under the
totality of the circumstances, a modification of custody is in the best interests of the child
(<a href="http://www.nycourts.gov/../2007/2007_03695.htm" target="_blank"><i>see Matter of Honeywell v
Honeywell</i>, 39 AD3d 857</a>, 858 [2007]; <a href="http://www.nycourts.gov/../2005/2005_06768.htm" target="_blank"><i>Cuccurullo v Cuccurullo</i>, 21 AD3d 983</a>, 984 [2005]).</p>
<p>To determine whether modification of a custody arrangement is in the best interests
of the child, the court must weigh several factors of varying degrees of importance,
including, inter alia, (1) the original placement of the child, (2) the length of that
placement, (3) the child's desires, (4) the relative fitness of the parents, (5) the quality of
the home environment, (6) the parental guidance given to the child, (7) the parent's
financial status, (8) his or her ability to provide for the child's emotional and intellectual
development, and (9) the willingness of the parent to assure meaningful contact between
the child and the other parent (<a href="http://www.nycourts.gov/../2013/2013_04785.htm" target="_blank"><i>see McAvoy v Hannigan</i>, 107 AD3d 960</a>, 962-963 [2013];
<a href="http://www.nycourts.gov/../2010/2010_00518.htm" target="_blank"><i>Matter of Mingo v
Belgrave</i>, 69 AD3d 859</a>, 859-860 [2010]; <i>Cuccurullo v Cuccurullo</i>, 21
AD3d at 984).</p>
<p>Weighing the factors relevant to any custody determination requires an evaluation of
the credibility and sincerity of the parties involved. Therefore, the hearing court's
credibility findings are accorded deference and its custody determinations will not be
disturbed unless they lack a sound and substantial basis in the record (<a href="http://www.nycourts.gov/../2012/2012_02498.htm" target="_blank"><i>see Matter of Jackson v
Coleman</i>, 94 AD3d 762</a>, 763 [2012]; <a href="http://www.nycourts.gov/../2011/2011_02663.htm" target="_blank"><i>Matter of Buxenbaum v Fulmer</i>, 82 AD3d 1223</a>, 1224
[2011]). However, the authority of an appellate court is as broad as that of the trial court
(<i>see Matter of Louise E.S. v W. Stephen S.</i>, 64 NY2d 946, 947 [1985]; <a href="http://www.nycourts.gov/../2013/2013_05524.htm" target="_blank"><i>Matter of Ellis v Burke</i>, 108
AD3d 764</a> [2013]), and an appellate court would be seriously remiss if, simply in
deference to the finding of a trial judge, it allowed a custody determination to stand
where it lacked a sound and substantial basis in the record (<a href="http://www.nycourts.gov/../2015/2015_05682.htm" target="_blank"><i>see Matter of Middleton v
Stringham</i>, 130 AD3d 627</a>, 629 [2015]; <a href="http://www.nycourts.gov/../2013/2013_07473.htm" target="_blank"><i>Matter of Cortez v Cortez</i>, 111 AD3d 717</a> [2013]; <a href="http://www.nycourts.gov/../2013/2013_03482.htm" target="_blank"><i>Matter of Iams v Estate of
Iams</i>, 106 AD3d 910</a>, 911 [2013]).</p>
<p>Here, viewing the totality of the circumstances, there is a sound and substantial basis
for the Supreme Court's determination that it is in the best interests of the children for the
mother to be awarded primary residential custody. Particularly relevant in this case are
the clearly stated preferences of the children, especially considering their age and
maturity, and the quality of the home environment provided by the mother (<a href="http://www.nycourts.gov/../2008/2008_06158.htm" target="_blank"><i>see Matter of Manfredo v
Manfredo</i>, 53 AD3d 498</a>, 500 [2008]; <a href="http://www.nycourts.gov/../2005/2005_04230.htm" target="_blank"><i>Matter of O'Connor v Dyer</i>, 18 AD3d 757</a> [2005]).</p>
<p>Moreover, under the circumstances of this case, the Supreme Court did not err in
denying the father's motion for an award of sole decision-making authority with respect
to the children, and continuing instead the existing provisions of the judgment of
divorce, which call for joint legal custody and joint decision-making authority. While
ordinarily it is not appropriate to award joint legal custody and decision-making authority
where the parties are antagonistic toward one another (<a href="http://www.nycourts.gov/../2014/2014_02016.htm" target="_blank"><i>see Irizarry v Irizarry</i>, 115
AD3d 913</a> [2014]), in this case, the record supports the court's finding that, despite
their antagonism, the parties have been able to agree on most decisions concerning the
children (<a href="http://www.nycourts.gov/../2014/2014_02785.htm" target="_blank"><i>see Matter of Thorpe v
Homoet</i>, 116 AD3d 962</a>, 963 [2014]). Moreover, the record supports the court's
finding that if either parent were awarded sole decision-making authority, there would be
a danger that it would be used to exclude the other parent from meaningful participation
<font color="FF0000">[*3]</font>in the children's lives. In addition, the court
appointed a parenting coordinator, who can assist the parents in resolving any disputes
they may have concerning decisions about the children.</p>
<p>We reject the father's contention that the Supreme Court erred in giving the daughter
discretion with respect to her mid-week visitation with him. It is true that awarding
visitation to a parent conditioned on the child's wishes is disfavored where it "tends
unnecessarily to defeat the right of visitation" (<i>Mahler v Mahler</i>, 72 AD2d 739,
739 [1979]; <a href="http://www.nycourts.gov/../2005/2005_07086.htm" target="_blank"><i>see Matter of
Kristine Z. v Anthony C.</i>, 21 AD3d 1319</a>, 1321 [2005]; <i>Pincus v Pincus</i>,
138 AD2d 687, 688 [1988]). However, in this case, the Supreme Court awarded the
father mid-week visitation with the daughter in the weeks before the mother's weekends,
with the daughter to have "the option to spend either Wednesday night or Thursday
night, or both, at the father's home." Contrary to the father's contention, while the
provision confers upon the daughter a limited measure of flexibility regarding the timing
and duration of her mid-week visitation with the father, it does not tend unnecessarily to
defeat the right of visitation.</p>
<p>The father's remaining contentions are without merit. Mastro, J.P., Chambers, Miller
and Hinds-Radix, JJ., concur.</p>
