	LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGEST


   AB 1589, Duvall. Vehicles: reports: reexaminations: removal.
   Existing law authorizes a peace officer, as defined, or a
regularly employed and salaried public employee, who is engaged in
directing traffic or enforcing parking laws and regulations, to
remove a vehicle when the vehicle is found or operated upon a
highway, public lands, or an offstreet parking facility with a
registration expiration date in excess of 6 months before the date it
is found or operated.
   This bill would provide additional instances relating to
registration when a vehicle may be removed from a highway, public
lands, or an offstreet parking facility.
   The bill would also make technical, nonsubstantive changes.
   This bill also would incorporate additional changes in Section
22651 of the Vehicle Code proposed by AB 1165 to be operative if AB
1165 and this bill are both enacted and this bill is enacted last.


THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

  SECTION 1.  Section 22651 of the Vehicle Code is amended to read:
   22651.  A peace officer, as defined in Chapter 4.5 (commencing
with Section 830) of Title 3 of Part 2 of the Penal Code, or a
regularly employed and salaried employee, who is engaged in directing
traffic or enforcing parking laws and regulations, of a city,
county, or jurisdiction of a state agency in which a vehicle is
located, may remove a vehicle located within the territorial limits
in which the officer or employee may act, under the following
circumstances:
   (a) When a vehicle is left unattended upon a bridge, viaduct, or
causeway or in a tube or tunnel where the vehicle constitutes an
obstruction to traffic.
   (b) When a vehicle is parked or left standing upon a highway in a
position so as to obstruct the normal movement of traffic or in a
condition so as to create a hazard to other traffic upon the highway.

   (c) When a vehicle is found upon a highway or public land and a
report has previously been made that the vehicle is stolen or a
complaint has been filed and a warrant thereon is issued charging
that the vehicle is embezzled.
   (d) When a vehicle is illegally parked so as to block the entrance
to a private driveway and it is impractical to move the vehicle from
in front of the driveway to another point on the highway.
   (e) When a vehicle is illegally parked so as to prevent access by
firefighting equipment to a fire hydrant and it is impracticable to
move the vehicle from in front of the fire hydrant to another point
on the highway.
   (f) When a vehicle, except highway maintenance or construction
equipment, is stopped, parked, or left standing for more than four
hours upon the right-of-way of a freeway that has full control of
access and no crossings at grade and the driver, if present, cannot
move the vehicle under its own power.
   (g) When the person in charge of a vehicle upon a highway or
public land is, by reason of physical injuries or illness,
incapacitated to an extent so as to be unable to provide for its
custody or removal.
   (h) (1) When an officer arrests a person driving or in control of
a vehicle for an alleged offense and the officer is, by this code or
other law, required or permitted to take, and does take, the person
into custody.
   (2) When an officer serves a notice of an order of suspension or
revocation pursuant to Section 13388.
   (i) (1) When a vehicle, other than a rented vehicle, is found upon
a highway or public land, or is removed pursuant to this code, and
it is known that the vehicle has been issued five or more notices of
parking violations to which the owner or person in control of the
vehicle has not responded within 21 calendar days of notice of
citation issuance or citation issuance or 14 calendar days of the
mailing of a notice of delinquent parking violation to the agency
responsible for processing notices of parking violation or the
registered owner of the vehicle is known to have been issued five or
more notices for failure to pay or failure to appear in court for
traffic violations for which a certificate has not been issued by the
magistrate or clerk of the court hearing the case showing that the
case has been adjudicated or concerning which the registered owner's
record has not been cleared pursuant to Chapter 6 (commencing with

   (2) The requirements in subparagraph (C) of paragraph (1) shall be
fully enforced by the impounding law enforcement agency on and after
the time that the Department of Motor Vehicles is able to provide
access to the necessary records.
   (3) A notice of parking violation issued for an unlawfully parked
vehicle shall be accompanied by a warning that repeated violations
may result in the impounding of the vehicle. In lieu of furnishing
satisfactory evidence that the full amount of parking penalties or
bail has been deposited, that person may demand to be taken without
unnecessary delay before a magistrate, for traffic offenses, or a
hearing examiner, for parking offenses, within the county in which
the offenses charged are alleged to have been committed and who has
jurisdiction of the offenses and is nearest or most accessible with
reference to the place where the vehicle is impounded. Evidence of

owner is or may be entitled, as security for the full amount of the
parking penalties for all notices of parking violations issued for
the vehicle and for all local administrative charges imposed pursuant

charges imposed pursuant to Section 22850.5.

local administrative charges imposed pursuant to Section 22850.5,
less the amount received from the sale of the vehicle.

she can be located.

72 or more consecutive hours in violation of a local ordinance

structures of unusual size, and the parking of a vehicle would
prohibit or interfere with that use or movement, and signs giving
notice that the vehicle may be removed are erected or placed at least
24 hours prior to the removal by local authorities pursuant to the
ordinance.
   (n) Whenever a vehicle is parked or left standing where local

peace officer, as defined in Chapter 4.5 (commencing with Section
830) of Title 3 of Part 2 of the Penal Code, may remove the vehicle.

a legally parked vehicle.

equipment, an authorized emergency vehicle, or a vehicle that is
properly permitted or otherwise authorized by the Department of
Transportation, is stopped, parked, or left standing for more than
