<h1 align="center"><font color="#800000">President Gerald R. Ford's
Message on the Observance of Black History Month</font></h1>
<p align="center"><font size="2">February 10, 1976 </font></p>
<p><font size="2">In the Bicentennial year of our Independence,
we can review with admiration the impressive contributions of
black Americans to our national life and culture. </font></p>
<p><font size="2">One hundred years ago, to help highlight these
achievements, Dr. Carter G. Woodson founded the Association for
the Study of Afro-American Life and History. We are grateful to
him today for his initiative, and we are richer for the work of
his organization. </font></p>
<p><font size="2">Freedom and the recognition of individual
rights are what our Revolution was all about. They were ideals
that inspired our fight for Independence: ideals that we have
been striving to live up to ever since. Yet it took many years
before ideals became a reality for black citizens. </font></p>
<p><font size="2">The last quarter-century has finally witnessed
significant strides in the full integration of black people into
every area of national life. In celebrating Black History Month,
we can take satisfaction from this recent progress in the
realization of the ideals envisioned by our Founding Fathers. But,
even more than this, we can seize the opportunity to honor the
too-often neglected accomplishments of black Americans in every
area of endeavor throughout our history. </font></p>
<p><font size="2">I urge my fellow citizens to join me in tribute
to Black History Month and the message of courage and
perseverance it brings to all of us. </font></p>
