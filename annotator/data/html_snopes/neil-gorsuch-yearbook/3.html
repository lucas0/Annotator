<p align="center"><a name="GULLIVER_ON_THE_BEACH__"><big><big>GULLIVER ON THE 
BEACH</big></big> </a></p>
<p align="left">     The United States entered its Bicentennial Year with great 
hoopla and fanfare.  But not even the star-spangled splendors served up by 
television, nor the less palatable pap pouring forth from politicians, could 
hide the stark reality:  The United States is failing as leader of the Free 
World.  It is being outflanked, outgunned, and out-maneuvered by the world 
communist movement. </p>
<p align="left">A nation which had an unquestioned eight-hundred percent 
strategic military superiority over the soviet Union in 1960 was settling, 
sixteen years later, for second-place status.  A country which led Europe and 
Japan to post-war recovery was itself being ravaged by inflation, recession, and 
unemployment. </p>
<p align="left">     A people who had never before lost a war watched helplessly 
as thousands of lives and billions of dollars were dumped into a conflict 
halfway around the world, while our own leaders said victory was not our goal. 
 After 50,000 American lives had been lost, a sham "peace" was arranged -- and 
within three months three former allies were clutched in Communist hands.   </p>
<p align="left">     As Red insurgency broke out in Thailand, burma and 
Malaysia, the Philippines decided to mend fences with communist china, North 
Korea again threatened to invade the South, and Singapore, Malaysia, Japan, and 
even Australia wondered aloud just how far they could count on the American 
presence in the Pacific. </p>
<p align="left">     The United States had already "opened the door" to mainland 
china, whose leaders are unquestionably the bloodiest mass murderers in human 
history.  Red China practiced a smiling and beguiling diplomacy toward the West, 
while serving as the world's major pusher of drugs. </p>
<p align="left">     In europe, a crumbling North Atlantic Treaty Organization 
was racked by dissension and outgunned by the Warsaw Pact military alliance. 
 Marxists seized power in Portugal, the new regime in Greece was intermittently 
hostile to the United States, communist Party strength in France and Italy was 
at an all-time high, and the Mediterranean was thoroughly dominated by the 
Russian fleet. </p>
<p align="left">     In the Middle East, a "peace" treaty had sown the seeds for 
a much greater war to come, the Suez Canal was opened to Communist vessels but 
denied to ships of the U.S. Navy, and russian "advisers" were moving into Africa 
by the tens of thousands.  Each sharp soviet thrust was met by a listless, 
ineffectual response from the United States. </p>
<p align="left">     While Red china was reporting its eighteenth nuclear test, 
the Soviet nuclear-powered submarines began operating from cuba, Russian vessels 
played cat-and-mouse with an anemic American fleet in the Pacific, and the 
massive soviet fishing fleet came very near to driving the U.s. fishing industry 
out of business. </p>
<p align="left">     In our own hemisphere, <i>detente</i>-numbed negotiators 
were simultaneously maneuvering to lift the U.S. quarantine of communist cuba, 
and, in outright defiance of Congress, were plotting to give away the Panama 
Canal. </p>
<p align="left">     As the communist world grew more powerful and more brazen, 
it was official United States policy to facilitate the wholesale gift of 
American advanced technology and sophisticated equipment to the Red bloc.  While 
the United States experienced double-digit inflation, its government secretly 
negotiated to give millions of dollars worth of foodstuffs to the Communists on 
credit.  And while the energy crisis grew worse, our weird policies had the dual 
effect of limiting U.S. production of oil while increasing the price of foreign 
imports. </p>
<p align="left">     At home, Congress and the communications media were 
questioning not the demonstrably growing Communist subversion and terror in this 
country, but the perils posed by our own security agencies.  While the FBI 
reported that there were at least 15,000 terrorists operating in the U.S., many 
openly encouraged, if not supplied and directed, by foreign powers, the United 
States was dismantling or hand-cuffing every major governmental unit charged 
with investigating such assaults on our security. </p>
<p align="left">     The American taxpayers continued to pay the lion's share of 
all expenses for the United Nations, which is dominated by a gaggle of Marxist 
dictatorships and "third world" totalitarians. The American host was abused by 
this parasitic combine virtually every day, often by member "governments" that 
practiced a bestiality and savagery usually associated with Stone Age tribes. 
 And, when the United States finally appointed an Ambassador who would (verbally 
at least) give as good as he got, he received so little support and so much 
criticism from our own State Department that he quit in disgust. </p>
<p align="left">     To any objective observer, it must have appeared that 
American leaders had followed Alice in her trip through the looking glass.  Or 
perhaps a collective madness had struck New York and Washington simultaneously. 
 How else can we explain such an amazing tangle of setbacks and surprises, 
mistakes and miscalculations, disastrous blunders and humiliating defeats? </p>
<p align="left">     Was this catastrophic foreign policy what most Americans 
expected when, in 1968 and 1972, they gave a thumping majority to a man who was 
hailed as "the conservative, businessman's President"? </p>
<p align="left">     Certainly not. </p>
<p align="left">     Do a majority of Americans favor recognizing Red Cuba?  Do 
they really concur in our abandoning the Panama Canal?  Are they for one-sided 
wheat deals and technological giveaways to the Soviets?  Do they agree that the 
Soviet Lend-Lease debt to the U.S. should be cancelled, that billions of dollars 
in other loans should be forgotten?  That the United States accept a lesser role 
in world affairs -- become a second-rate power, no longer capable of defending 
its allies or its own freedom?  Of course not! </p>
<p align="left">     The obvious truth is that a majority of American, armed 
with the above information, would oppose these policy decisions.  This political 
fact of life was reflected in the campaign rhetoric of 1976, as the 
Administration pushed such unpleasant subjects as the Panama giveaway and the 
consequences of <i>detente </i>to a back burner. </p>
<p align="left">     As children we read in <i>Gulliver's Travels</i> of how the 
normal-sized Gulliver, washed ashore on an island run by diminutive 
Lilliputians, was captured and tied down by his tiny hosts.  gulliver possessed 
more than enough strength to smash all of Lilliput -- at first.  And yet, he 
found himself completely at the mercy of the Lilliputians. He had been bound 
down, while he slept, by thousands of tiny threads.  Each single strand could 
have been broken, but the cumulative effect of all of them put Gulliver totally 
under the power of his enemies. </p>
<p align="left">      The United States today is in much the same, if you will 
pardon the pun, bind.  This giant of the world, possessor of the greatest 
productive capacity in the history of man, with its awesome defensive and 
offensive power, is being immobilized by a seemingly endless array of isolated 
acts.  But the net effect of <i>all </i>of the pacts, agreements, treaties, and 
accords is to paralyze American strength just as surely as Gulliver was held 
down by his physically inferior captors. </p>
<p align="left">     Undergirding this book is the conviction that what has 
happened to the United States, and what continues to happen -- this incredible 
lopsided weakening of the United States, while we pursue policies that support 
and strengthen our enemies -- is not the result of mere happenstance. </p>
<p align="left">     We believe that much of what is happening in the world 
today can be explained by one single, terrible word: conspiracy.  The basic 
outline of the plot, the historical background and present purposes of the most 
important protagonists, have been discussed by the author in two previous works 
(None Dare Call It Conspiracy and The Rockefeller File)  It is not our purpose 
to replow all of that ground again here. </p>
<p align="left">     Yes, we believe it is possible for moral, intellectually 
honest men to believe in globalism, the evolution of a world government, the 
need to reduce tensions, to "build bridges of understanding", and similar 
slogans.  We also believe that the great majority of persons promoting such 
policies are sincere and well-meaning.  We can accept the explanation that they 
truly believe what they are doing will benefit all of humanity. </p>
<p align="left">     But. . . this does not mean that they are right.  Or even 
that everyone in their corner really is sincere.  Alger Hiss managed to convince 
every Liberal who knew him that he was just another sympathetic sheep in the 
fold.  His friends forgot that there are real wolves in the world. </p>
<p align="left">     This book is the account of one man who, we believe, may be 
another wolf, entrusted with the job of protecting the sheep. It is the story of 
the person who, more than any other individual inside the U.S. government, has 
been the chief architect and apologist for the policies whose effects we have 
summarized above.  It is the record of the present Secretary of State, Henry A. 
Kissinger. </p>
<p align="left">     As we examine each part of the record, we will find that 
the indictment is a terrible one.  This will not be an Horatio Alger account of 
the rise of a poor immigrant boy to power and fame; it is not a self-serving 
piece of puffery that has been sanitized of all unpleasant facts.  This will be 
a cold, hard look at the record. </p>
<p align="left">     Quite simply, we believe that Dr. Kissinger's continued 
occupation of a powerful position in our government presents a clear and present 
danger to this Republic.  As we penetrate the cloak of falsehood and deception 
that has been erected to protect the man and myth, we will find that Dr. 
Kissinger has deliberately misled the Congress and the American people on 
numerous occasions. </p>
<p align="left">     Perhaps, as at least one defector from the Communist 
intelligence network has charged, it is possible that Kissinger's policies have 
been so favorable to the Communist bloc because he works for them! </p>
<p align="left">     Is Henry A. Kissinger a conscious, willful agent of a 
conspiratorial apparatus working for a New World Order?  Or is he rather a vain, 
brilliant, twisted intellectual?  Maybe he is both of these. </p>
<p align="left">     One thing is certain:  Dr. Kissinger has owed far more 
allegiance to the globe-girdling interests of the House of Rockefeller than to 
his ostensible superiors in the White House, or even to the American people he 
purports to serve.  (And the best interests of Americans, and America, are by no 
means synonymous with the Grand Design of the House of Rockefeller!) </p>
<p align="left">     The issue today is not whom he serves (although that 
question is crucial), but what he has done.  That is the subject, and the only 
subject, of this study.  We have no access to secret documents, classified 
information, or the like.  Everything in this book is taken from the public 
record.  In the pages that follow, there is little that is new.  but there is 
much that is shocking. </p>
<p align="left">     We hope this indictment makes you angry.  We hope it makes 
you think.  And then, we hope it makes you act.  For we believe that the future 
of this land of liberty may well depend on whether -- and how soon -- our 
present disastrous course can be changed. </p>

<p align="left">EXCERPTS: </p>
<p align="left">     Who, after all, <i>is</i> Henry Kissinger?  He is not, to 
begin with, Henry Kissinger.  He was born <b>Heinz Alfred Kissinger</b> on May 
27, 1923, in Fuerth, Germany, <b>the son of </b>Louis Kissinger, a school 
teacher and <b>rabbi</b>, and the former <b>Paula Stern</b>. Like many Jewish 
families feeling the rising impact of Naziism, the Kissinger family fled Germany 
to the United States in 1938."   </p>
<p align="left">[Questions: Was his mother, Paula Stern, related in any way to 
the famed terrorist "Stern Gang" in Israel? How did the family manage to escape 
the alleged 'gas chambers' in 1938? Five years earlier, In August, 1933, in 
his ABC broadcast declaring a Holy War against Germany, <font color="blue"><u>
Samuel Untermeyer</u></font> exclaimed that:  "We must save the 600,000 Jews in 
Germany",  That is not a typo. The number of Jews in Germany at that time, 
according to Untermeyer was 600,000, not 6,000,000, and they had begun leaving 
nearly as soon as Hitler took office.  - JP - transcriber} </p>
<p align="left">     As presidential adviser, and later as Secretary of State 
for the outgoing President, Henry Kissinger had: Handled the Intermittent Middle 
East war so ably that. . . <b>Kissinger had represented both the Soviets <i>and</i> 
the United States in the negotiations there</b>." </p>
<p align="left">     Henry the K was nothing less than an outright Rockefeller 
agent ready to carry the family's "Grand Design" into the White House. " </p>
<p align="left">     He was the man who said "power is the ultimate 
aphrodisiac", and who was quoted in New York Times magazine as joking, "The 
illegal we do immediately. the unconstitutional takes a little longer"." </p>
<p align="left">     (It was during this period as intelligence-gatherer and 
interrogator, one defecting communist double-agent has claimed, that <b>
Kissinger himself was recruited by the KGB</b> and given the code name Bor. 
 More on this in Chapter Eleven.)" </p>
<p align="left">     At the 1971 shake-up, Nixon created a special committee to 
which the CIA director, the Attorney General, the Under-Secretary of State, the 
Deputy Secretary of Defense, and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff would 
henceforth report.  Chairman of the strategic committee was -- surprise! -- 
Henry the K. </p>
<p align="left">     He controlled every piece of intelligence to reach the 
President from the State Department, the Defense, Department, and the Central 
Intelligence Agency. </p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p align="center"><a name="THE_MAN_BEHIND_THE_MYTH__"><big><big>THE MAN BEHIND 
THE MYTH</big></big> </a></p>
<p align="left">     When President Nixon finally told the man he had appointed 
as Vice President of his decision to resign, the first thing Gerald Ford did was 
telephone Secretary of State Henry Kissinger. </p>
<p align="left">     It was August 1974, and all the king's horses and all the 
king's men couldn't put Richard Nixon together again.   Watergate had already 
cut deeply, toppling presidential advisers, counselors, election campaign 
chiefs, an attorney general -- and now a President. </p>
<p align="left">     The only member of the inner circle apparently untouched by 
it all was the pudgy, beak-nosed Secretary of State, a man whose 
less-than-spectacular visage had already graced the covers of more magazines 
than any other presidential adviser in history.  The king of flight-bag 
diplomats, who was continually jetting off to "resolve" another world crisis, 
had come to be known variously as "Henry the K", "Superman", Super Kraut", and 
other, even more flowery, descriptions. </p>
<p align="left">     This physically undistinguished diplomat with the deeply 
guttural German accent, who had so often been seen in public with gorgeous 
starlets and well-connected socialites, was reputed to be a secret -- and very 
successful -- swinger. </p>
<p align="left">     This was the man -- and the myth -- to whom the appointed 
vice President turned <i>first </i>after it was apparent that Richard Nixon, 
enmeshed in a web of tapes and cover-ups, was being forced from office by a 
scandal whose origins had been murky and whose political outcome was 
devastating. </p>
<p align="left">     We are told it was Ford who requested a meeting with 
Kissinger -- a meeting which lasted two hours.  The soft-spoken Midwesterner 
prevailed on the whiz-kid super-diplomat to stay on.  It was about as tough a 
sale as peddling a snow cone to a thirsty Arab.  <i>Time </i>says Ford simply 
told Henry, "I need you". <i>Jawohl</i>, replied Henry.  Later, in his first 
public utterance as President-successor, Ford announced that all was well with 
the Republic because Kissinger had consented to remain on the job. </p>
<p align="left">     The whole scenario seemed strangely out of place for a 
reportedly conservative, Midwestern Republican.  After all, Vice President Ford 
and President Nixon had both been presented to their party -- and to the nation 
-- as a "conservative, pro-business" candidates and office holders.  Yet in 1968 
Nixon's first major appointment was to place Henry Kissinger in the key post of 
Adviser for National Security Affairs. </p>
<p align="left">     But, as presidential adviser, and later as Secretary of 
State for the outgoing President, Henry Kissinger had: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p align="left">Been the primary architect of the "opening" to Communist 
	china, while working secretly behind the scenes to oust the Republic of 
	China {Taiwan} from the United Nations, which Free China had helped found.
	</p></li>
<li>
<p align="left">Emerged as spokesman for appeasement of and "rapprochement" 
	with the Soviet Union, and promoted policies which guaranteed the Soviet 
	Union a strategic military superiority over the U.S. </p></li>
<li>
<p align="left">Arranged for supplying the latest American technology and 
	know-how to the Soviet block, while waiving $11 billion owed the United 
	States by the Soviet government. </p></li>
<li>
<p align="left">Provided the U.S.S.R. with American wheat on incredibly 
	favorable credit terms, while bread prices skyrocketed at home. </p></li>
<li>
<p align="left">Designed the Vietnam "peace" accords with the North 
	Vietnamese Communists (for which he shared a Nobel "Peace" Prize), 
	agreements which guaranteed the Communists victory in Vietnam in the <i>
	first </i>war ever lost by this country. </p></li>
<li>
<p align="left">Handled the Intermittent Middle East war so ably that, 
	according to his friend, Soviet Ambassador Anatoly Dobrynin, Kissinger had 
	represented both the Soviets and the United States in the negotiations 
	there. </p></li>
<li>
<p align="left">Alienated such long-time American allies as Turkey and 
	Greece, thus weakening NATO and allowing the Soviet Union to dominate the 
	entire Mediterranean. </p></li>
<li>
<p align="left">Urged a policy of "reconciliation" with Communist Cuba, a 
	Soviet satellite successfully planted in the Western Hemisphere which 
	subsequently sent "volunteers" to stage a Communist coup in Angola. </p></li>
<li>
<p align="left">Attempted, despite massive Congressional and public 
	opposition, to surrender American sovereignty over the Panama Canal, and 
	endorsed the claims of a Moscow-lining Panamanian dictator to the vital 
	waterway. </p></li>
<li>
<p align="left">Supported a boycott of anti-Communist Rhodesia as a "threat 
	to world peace" with the result that the U.S. became dependent on the Soviet 
	Union for chrome ore. </p></li>
</ul>
<p align="left">     As national security adviser, Kissinger had created an 
information-gathering, policy-deciding empire far vaster than anything assembled 
by his predecessors.  He was given so much authority by Nixon that he became the 
second most powerful man in the White House -- if not the most powerful. (His 
"boss" did not survive Watergate; Henry did.) </p>
<p align="left">     He was the man who said "power is the ultimate 
aphrodisiac", and who was quoted in New York Times magazine as joking, "The 
illegal we do immediately. the unconstitutional takes a little longer". </p>
<p align="left">     This is the man who eavesdropped on his own staff and 
bugged suspect newsmen, but who, when challenged about it, blackmailed both 
Congress and the media by threatening to resign if they did not ignore his role 
in the telephone taps. </p>
<p align="left">     Yet, this was the man whom <i>Time</i> called "the world's 
indispensable man" and whom <i>Newsweek</i> caricatured as a flying superman.
</p>
<p align="left">     Like the rest of his image, Henry's reputation as an 
over-sexed Lothario who sweeps the girls off their feet seems strangely 
contrived.  Kissinger courted his first wife, Ann Fleischer, for seven long 
years before the two were wed.  It was another ten years before their first 
child was born.  Prior to his political stardom, Henry was no Speedy Gonzales.
</p>
<p align="left">     There have been various descriptions of how at a party 
given by Barbara Howar for women's lib propagandist Gloria Steinem, Henry 
referred to himself as a "secret swinger".  The phrase swept the cocktail 
circuit gossip line and stuck.  Henry subsequently was able to parlay his 
self-stimulated reputation into much-photographed evenings with Jill St. John, 
Marlo Thomas, Hope Lange, Samantha Eggar, and Judy Brown.  The latter, who 
starred in a Danish pornography film entitled "Threesome", enhanced his Don Juan 
reputation when she called in reporters to discuss their eighteen-month 
"relationship". </p>
<p align="left">     These were part of the boola boola build-up of the man who 
had the most meteoric rise to power in contemporary American history.  Yet there 
were other, less-flattering descriptions of Henry the K.  But the negative 
comments were overwhelmed by the press-agentry which cast the middle-aged 
professor in his Superman sex-symbol role. </p>
<p align="left">     Writer Noel. E. Parmentel describes how after Ann Fleischer 
"literally slaved to send him through graduate school", Kissinger browbeat her 
unbelievably by his abusive screaming and shouting.  He was ashamed of <i>her
</i>New York accent; he told her she embarrassed him in front of "important 
people".  The marriage broke up after fifteen years -- just as Henry began to 
taste public (and, presumably, private) success. </p>
<p align="left">     Friends and ex-associates describe Kissinger as a man who 
was "openly cruel" to Ann Fleischer, who sulked petulantly whenever he was 
upstaged, and who ignored anyone who couldn't help him. </p>
<p align="left">     A former Kissinger staff member described him this way: 
 "He's got us all buffaloed.  He can (and will) lift your security, get you a 
foundation black ball, bong you at the colleges, put you in Coventry.  He's got 
spies in every department.  He's running the Ministry of Fear.  All of his 
phones are tapped and he keeps long dossiers".  Another Kissinger ex-staffer 
added: "In my book Hank Kissinger is a suspicious, fearful misanthrope 
surrounded by people who are compelled to maintain a low profile to keep their 
jobs.  I'd sooner dig ditches than work for him again." </p>
<p align="left">     And there have been even more sinister assessments of the 
Kissinger psyche.  Phyllis Schlafly and Rear Admiral Chester Ward (USN-Ret.) 
produced an exhaustive study of Kissinger deeds, misdeeds, and mentality.  Their 
800-page analysis, <i>Kissinger on the Couch</i>, concludes that Kissinger is 
obsessed with both megalomania and defeatism.  They contend he is a man so 
driven by a lust for power that he would lie to anyone, including the President, 
to achieve a goal. </p>
<p align="left">     Former Nixon aide Charles W. Colson, the Watergate victim 
who spoke out clearly about conspiracy in high places, has said that Nixon told 
him as early as December 18, 1973, that Kissinger "is really unstable at times". 
 A woman staff assistant at Harvard has recalled: "He appeared to have this fear 
that other lecturers were laughing behind his back.  I feel certain that if a 
proper mental diagnosis had been made in 1962, he would have been declared 
sick".  This, of course, is the classic description of paranoia. </p>
<p align="left">     This was the strangely mercurial, contradictory man to whom 
Gerald Ford, the unlikely President, turned <i>immediately</i> as Nixon prepared 
to leave the presidency. </p>
<p align="left">     How did a German immigrant, who once said his highest 
ambition was to become an accountant, zoom from academic obscurity to the second 
most powerful position in the White House -- all within five years? </p>
<p align="left">     At first blush, the phenomenon seems as inexplicable as 
Richard Nixon leaving the tape recorder on. </p>
<p align="left">     Can we really believe that President Nixon plucked Henry 
Kissinger out of the academic ozone, as <i>Time</i> reported, just on the basis 
of having met him at a cocktail party, and remembering reading an earlier 
Kissinger book? </p>
<p align="left">     Is it reasonable to believe that Nixon, a super partisan, 
would give the position of what amounted to "assistant President in charge of 
foreign policy" to a Harvard Professor who never claimed to be a Republican? 
 Are we to believe that Nixon was so enraptured by the genius of this man who 
can hardly speak English that he gave him one of the most important appointments 
in his administration? </p>
<p align="left">     Well, hardly.  Nothing about the Kissinger rollercoaster 
career makes an iota of sense -- not his surprising selection by Nixon as 
security adviser, not his deliberate acquisition of more power than any similar 
White House official had ever enjoyed before, not his appointment as Secretary 
of State, not his survival of the Watergate sweep which eliminated all other 
Nixon advisers, not his preeminent position in the Ford Administration -- unless 
we ask who placed Henry Kissinger on his Yellow Brick Road in the first place. 
 Henry was not provided with magic glass slippers by the Witch of the East.  He 
had something better. </p>
<p align="left">     Once you strip away all of the puffery, press-agentry, and 
Madison Avenue hokum which have been erected around the persona of Henry 
Kissinger, one unmistakable fact emerges:  Henry Kissinger is now and, for all 
of his political life, has been an agent of the mightiest combine of power, 
finance, and influence in American politics:  The House of Rockefeller. (The 
story of the alarming power and frightening ambition of the House of Rockefeller 
is told in detail in the <i>Rockefeller File </i>by Gary Allen, published 
earlier this year [1976] by '76 Press.) </p>
<p align="left">     Said <i>U.S. News &amp; World Report </i>on November 1, 1971: 
 "It was on the advice of Governor Rockefeller, who described Mr. Kissinger as 
'the smartest guy available', that Mr. Nixon chose him for his top adviser on 
foreign policy". </p>
<p align="left">     The <i>Deseret News</i> had already quoted a Rockefeller 
aide as saying:  "Rocky set up the job for Henry because he. . . thought it 
might (!) give (Rockefeller) some voice in U.S. foreign policy". </p>
<p align="left">     Just as Nixon was packaged and peddled to the American 
people as a conservative with middle-American values who would stand up to the 
effete Eastern Establishment, Kissinger -- incredibly enough -- was initially 
promoted as a conservative and staunch anti-Communist.  Erstwhile conservative 
William F. Buckley, for example, hailed as "a happy office" Nixon's first major 
appointment, and described the 45-year-old professor Kissinger as "the 
anti-Communist at Harvard".  While Buckley was pleased, his supposed opposites 
on the Left were gleefully adoring. </p>
<p align="left">     Adam Yarmolinsky, the notorious Leftist who was responsible 
for the appointment of Robert Strange McNamara as Secretary of Defense, 
declared:  "I will sleep better with Henry Kissinger in Washington".   </p>
<p align="left">     Arthur Schlesinger, Jr. stated:  "I think it's an excellent 
appointment.  It's very encouraging.  He's the best they'll get." </p>
<p align="left">     While the Liberal press went into paroxysms of ecstasy over 
Nixon's appointment of a Harvard intellectual to the post of Adviser on National 
Security Affairs, little attention was paid to the fact that Kissinger could not 
even assume the most sensitive White House job there is, outside of the 
Presidency itself, until he was given a security waiver by his new boss.  The 
reasons Kissinger could never pass accurate security procedures will be 
discussed in a subsequent chapter. </p>
<p align="left">    Who, after all, <i>is</i> Henry Kissinger? </p>
<p align="left">     He is not, to begin with, Henry Kissinger.  He was born 
Heinz Alfred Kissinger on May 27, 1923, in Fuerth, Germany, the son of Louis 
Kissinger, a school teacher and rabbi, and the former Paula Stern. Like many 
Jewish families feeling the rising impact of Naziism, the Kissinger family fled 
Germany to the United States in 1938. </p>
<p align="left">     Already a skilled debater when he arrived in America at the 
age of fifteen, Heinz -- now Henry -- did well in rhetoric and other fields as a 
high school student in New York City.  when he graduated with honors, he said 
that his highest ambition was to be an accountant. </p>
<p align="left">     But fate, in the form of World War II, intervened.  Drafted 
into the U.S. Army in 1943 -- a process which also made him an American citizen 
-- the young Kissinger was "discovered" by a fellow German refugee, Dr. Fritz 
Kraemer.  Kraemer served in American military intelligence and got Kissinger 
promoted into the 970th counter-intelligence detachment.  when hostilities 
ceased, Kissinger's special position enabled him to become the virtual dictator 
of a German town, where he commandeered a villa and began living in the grand 
manner.  He administered an entire district and, as a civil service employee, 
received the then-considerable salary of $10,000 per year. </p>
<p align="left">     Henry ruled his quasi-fiefdom until April 1946, when he was 
transferred to the European command Intelligence School.  (It was during this 
period as intelligence-gatherer and interrogator, one defecting communist 
double-agent has claimed, that Kissinger himself was recruited by the KGB and 
given the code name Bor.  More on this in Chapter Eleven.) </p>
<p align="left">     After leaving the Army, Kissinger enrolled at Harvard 
University, majoring in government and securing four scholarships.  It can be 
argued that Heinz, er Henry, had already been tapped by important people as a 
man with a future. </p>
<p align="left">     Competition for admission to Harvard is always super stiff. 
 But in 1946, with all the veterans trying to squeeze in, it was incredible. 
 Yet, little Heinz, the refugee, not only gained admission but had his education 
paid in full by multiple scholarships. </p>
<p align="left">     Harvard was the turning point in Kissinger's life. 
 (Assuming, of course, that a more sinister turning point had not already 
occurred in his Army intelligence days in post-war Germany, through a working 
relationship with Soviet agents.) </p>
<p align="left">     With the help of a grant from the Rockefeller Foundation 
Fellowship for Political Theory, the bright young ex-intelligence officer 
graduated from Harvard in 1950.  but Kissinger did not stop there; he received 
his MA in 1952 and a doctorate in 1954.  His dream of becoming an accountant was 
obviously fading faster than bookings for a return voyage on the <i>Titanic. </i>
</p>
<p align="left">     Somehow, somewhere, something happened to Herr Kissinger 
along the academic way.  First came the grant from the Rockefellers.  Then, 
while he was working on his Master's, Kissinger was made executive director of 
the Harvard International Seminar -- a student exchange program which was later 
found to be financed by the Central Intelligence Agency. </p>
<p align="left">     While working toward his doctorate, he was employed on 
numerous occasions as a consultant for various government agencies.  Kissinger 
apparently made a favorable impression on those members of the Eastern Liberal 
Establishment who look for reliable bright young men.  With the support of his 
mentor, Professor William Elliott, a well-connected Establishmentarian.   </p>
<p align="left">     Henry was ushered into that repository of power and 
prestige, the elusive, secretive Council on Foreign Relations -- perhaps the 
nation's most important and influential organization.  (More about the CFR in 
the next chapter.) </p>
<p align="left">     At the same time, he also became affiliated with the 
Rockefeller Brothers Trust Fund.  For a young German immigrant still hampered by 
a heavy accent, Kissinger had obviously arrived.  If the House of Rockefeller 
approved him, who would say him <i>nein</i>? </p>
<p align="left">     Kissinger next was promoted to associate director of 
Harvard's Center for International Affairs and director of its special Studies 
Project.  In 1956, his fellow harvard alumni and CFR members McGeorge Bundy, 
Arthur Schlesinger, Jr., and William Elliott suggested Kissinger become editor 
of <i>Foreign Affairs</i>, the very influential quarterly journal of the 
Rockefeller's Council on Foreign Relations. </p>
<p align="left">     Henry declined the opportunity to polish other men's prose, 
electing instead to write an analysis of nuclear weapons.  The result was 
Kissinger's first book, <i>Nuclear Weapons and foreign Policy</i>, which 
impressed many persons (including then-Vice President Richard Nixon) and drew 
supportive comments from such disparate sources as National Review and security 
risk J. Robert Oppenheimer.   </p>
<p align="left">     This book has been quoted over and over again by 
"conservatives" like William F. Buckley who try to pass off Kissinger as an 
anti-Communist.  The truth is that in his second book, <i>The necessity for 
Choice</i>, Kissinger admitted that he had reconsidered his earlier views, and 
had reached a vastly different conclusion.  The result was an espousal of 
"flexible response" and "limited warfare" and the other cliches which resulted 
in sending 500,000 men into a no-win war in Vietnam. </p>
<p align="left">     With the force of the Rockefeller-CFR propaganda arm behind 
him, Henry was now attracting national attention in high circles.  He was 
invited to attend the infamous Pugwash Conferences, the "private" 
Soviet-American meetings sponsored by Soviet apologist Cyrus Eaton.   </p>
<p align="left">     In later years, the pro-Communist bias of the Pugwash 
reports would be generally acknowledged, even by Liberals. </p>
<p align="left">     Kissinger got into the governmental advisory business under 
Democratic President John F. Kennedy.  He served as a special consultant to JFK 
during the Berlin crisis and also was appointed to the Arms Control and 
disarmament Agency. </p>
<p align="left">     At the CIA-funded Harvard International Seminar, Kissinger 
founded a magazine called <i>Confluence</i>, which eventually came under the 
close scrutiny of the Defense Department because of its pro-Communist bias. </p>
<p align="left">     If the magazine correctly reflected Kissinger's views, and 
if his second book corrected his earlier comments on national security <i>
vis-a-vis</i> the Communists, then Henry put it all together in his third book,
<i>The Troubled Partnership</i>, published in the mid-60s. </p>
<p align="left">     This CFR-sponsored volume in effect called for the merging 
of the United States with the increasingly socialist nations of Europe into a 
single nation, as part of what Kissinger called a "Grand Design". </p>
<p align="left">     The services Kissinger had begun for Kennedy were continued 
for his successor.  Henry represented the Johnson Administration on three secret 
missions to Vietnam, two of them to North Vietnam.  but while serving these two 
Democratic presidents, Henry was also the key foreign policy adviser to 
Republican Nelson Rockefeller. </p>
<p align="left">     In fact, it was even reported that Kissinger, who never had 
a good word to say about Richard Nixon prior to his appointment by him, wept 
openly when Nelson Rockefeller lost his 1968 bid to garner the Republican 
nomination for President. </p>
<p align="left">     According to an account by United Press International, 
Kissinger was "reluctant" to accept Nixon's "surprise offer" of a presidential 
appointment.  Rockefeller, K's employer for ten years, made up his mind for him, 
according to UPI, when he told Henry that if he did not accept it, "never talk 
to me again". </p>
<p align="left">     Later, during a party celebrating Henry Kissinger's 
fiftieth birthday, Rocky toasted his longtime employee, saying that he'd been 
associated with him in three Presidential campaigns and "We succeeded in the 
third.  Henry went to the White House". </p>
<p align="left">     Henry's sadness at leaving the direct employment of 
Rockefeller -- a position that had seen his salary jump from $500 a month in 
July 1958 to a much more comfortable $4,000 a month a mere ten years later -- 
was no doubt partially assuaged by Nelson's parting token of appreciation:  a 
check for $50,000. </p>
<p align="left">     Rockefeller later explained that he wanted to do something 
to help out a "poor guy faced with tremendous obligations".  Of course, if any 
other billionaire businessman did it, we would call it bribery.  with 
Rockefeller, it's simply a nice gesture. </p>
<p align="left">     Keep in mind that the Rockefellers own properties and do 
business in some 125 separate nations, including the Soviet Union and Red china. 
 Every decision Kissinger would make in Washington was a potential conflict of 
interest involving his sponsor and benefactor, Rockefeller.  Yet, even in the 
wake of Watergate, when the "gift" was revealed at Rocky's Vice Presidential 
confirmation hearings, the story caused no more splash than a leaf falling from 
a tree.  The TV anchormen did not even mention it. </p>
<p align="left">     In tracing Henry's meteoric rise from obscurity to 
international acclaim, we see that his magic slippers had the Rockefeller label. 
 From Henry's membership in the Rockefeller's CFR while a professor at Harvard, 
to his association with a host of Rockefeller-connected activities, to his 
appointments in Washington, even to his second marriage, the Rockefeller power, 
prestige, and influence were paving the way for him. </p>
<p align="left">     (Nancy Maginnes, Henry's new wife, was -- and remains -- a 
Rockefeller employee.  The relationship is such a family affair that Nelson even 
supplied the jet that whisked the couple to their honeymoon retreat, and threw a 
lavish party for them when they returned to Washington.) </p>
<p align="left">     This, then, was the background of Richard Nixon's <i>most 
important</i> appointment. The man selected as chief adviser to the President 
was a trusted spokesman for the Council on Foreign Relations.  In fact, Henry 
the K was nothing less than an outright Rockefeller agent ready to carry the 
family's "Grand Design" into the White House. </p>
<p align="left">     Kissinger promptly began to centralize his power and to 
promote his Grand Design.  Or, as he and the Rockefellers now call it, the "New 
World Order".  It came as no surprise to Kissinger-watchers when President Nixon 
reorganized U.S. intelligence operations in 1971 and Kissinger emerged at the 
pinnacle of power.   </p>
<p align="left">     Henry had put together the largest team ever to serve the 
national security adviser.  Many of his key aides and assistants were holdovers 
from the Kennedy-Johnson Administration.   </p>
<p align="left">     At the 1971 shake-up, Nixon created a special committee to 
which the CIA director, the Attorney General, the Under-Secretary of State, the 
Deputy Secretary of Defense, and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff would 
henceforth report.  Chairman of the strategic committee was -- surprise! -- 
Henry the K. </p>
<p align="left">     As the <i>Los Angeles Times </i>reported, "efficiency" was 
not the real reason for the move.  The White House was said to be "unhappy" 
because certain military bureaus -- particularly the Defense Intelligence Agency 
-- were too "hard-line" in their interpretations of Communist plans, whereas CIA 
Director Richard Helms, a long-time Kissinger chum, and Kissinger himself could 
be counted on to take a more <i>reasonable</i> view. </p>
<p align="left">     In any case, by 1971 Henry had become, as the <i>Times </i>
noted, virtually "all-powerful in the sprawling sector of the government which 
seeks to advise the President on national security matters".  His dominance of 
the expanded, 110-member National Security Council was so complete that he 
controlled every piece of intelligence to reach the President from the State 
Department, the Defense, Department, and the Central Intelligence Agency. </p>
<p align="left">     Never before in the history of the United States had such 
colossal power been put into the hands of an unelected official.  Despite the 
obvious dangers, the <font color="blue"><u>media</u></font> were quieter than 
Charlie McCarthy when Edgar Bergen is away. </p>
<p align="left">     It became common knowledge that Kissinger spent more time 
with the President than any other White House staffer, and the President 
frequently dropped into his office, less than a half-minute away from his own. 
 Long-time Washington reporter Clark Mollenhoff noted, "Officially, the 
47-year-old former Harvard professor of government is the 'Assistant to the 
President for National Security Affairs' at a salary of $42,500 a year.  But, in 
fact, he has become the Number Two Man in all matters dealing with the Defense 
and State Departments". </p>
<p align="left">     Numero Uno was of course the President himself, not the man 
confirmed by the Senate as Secretary of State.  It was common knowledge on the 
Washington cocktail circuit that Kissinger had far more power than the actual 
Secretary of State, William P. Rogers. </p>
<p align="left">     It was in August 1973, during a dip in the presidential 
pool at Nixon's San Clemente home, that the President finally popped the 
question to the man who was already Secretary of State in all but name. "If you 
will let me, I would like to nominate you for Secretary of State tomorrow", <i>
Time</i> claims was the Nixon approach. </p>
<p align="left">     We find it a little hard to believe <i>Time's</i> 
follow-up:  "No matter how prepared Henry Kissinger may have been for that 
moment, it still stunned him." </p>
<p align="left">     By the time the question was put to him, the <i>de facto
</i>Secretary of State was already known as the architect of East-West <i>
detente</i>, the chief spokesman for appeasement and rapprochement, the man 
whose "ping-pong diplomacy" secured the opening to Red China, the statesman who 
would bring peace to Southeast Asia, the brilliant diplomat who would defuse the 
powder-keggy Middle East. </p>
<p align="left">     Kissinger -- <i>Time</i> magazine's Man of the Year -- <i>
stunned</i>?  About as stunned as Dean Martin upon being nominated to the 
Imbibers Hall of Fame. </p>
<p align="left">     The next day Kissinger greeted newsmen at the Western White 
House and demonstrated that modest was still not one of his hallmarks.  Asked 
how he now preferred to be addressed, he replied:  "Oh, I don't stand on 
protocol.  If you will just call me Excellency, it will be okay". </p>
<p align="left">     Only two members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee 
even bothered to sit through the two and one-half hours of hearings on the 
Kissinger nomination as the nation's first foreign-born Secretary of State. 
 Perfunctory approval followed swiftly in the full Senate; the final vote was 78 
ayes to 7 nays. </p>
<p align="left">     (Henry's strong guttural accent, after more than four 
decades in the United States, is itself an intriguing mystery.  After all, 
Henry's wheeler-dealer businessman brother Walter speaks English with perfect 
diction.  <i>TV Guide </i>reported on January 26, 1974 that "it is believed by 
some that Kissinger was kept off television for his first two years in the 
Administration because the White House feared that the German accent would be a 
poor image".) </p>
<p align="left">     Finally, Henry had it made.  He was in the limelight now. 
 He ran a vast empire, in name as well as in deed.  He presided over 12,000 
diplomats, code clerks, economic analysts, linguists, secretaries, and the like. 
 His salary was a comfortable $60,000 per year.  But, ahh, the perquisites, 
prestige, and power! </p>
<p align="left">     During his confirmation hearings, it was revealed that 
Kissinger headed the most immense intelligence-gathering and policy-determining 
apparatus in White House history.  At the time of the confirmation, Kissinger 
was: a) head of the national Security Council, b) chairman of every important 
committee on the Council,  c) the man to whom the CIA director reported, and  d) 
chairman of the "Forty" Committee, the "covert operations" arm of the NSC.  As 
Senator Stuart Symington observed to our hero: </p>
<p align="left">     "If you stay in two positions, head of State and also head 
of the National Security Council, you are going to be in a position where you 
are going to have unprecedented authority never granted to anybody but the 
President." </p>
<p align="left">     And that is just what Kissinger got -- with not a yelp from 
the fawning media. </p>
<p align="left">     The intelligence empire over which Kissinger reigned and 
reigns is far vaster than just the State Department.  It includes some 16 major 
agencies, with 200,000 employees, a total annual budget in excess of $6 billion, 
and controls the most sophisticated gadgetry and computers on the planet. </p>
<p align="left">     And there is no doubt at all that Henry wanted every jot 
and tittle of delicious power and delectable authority he could get.  The <i>
Washington Star </i>of November 19, 1972 quotes Super K as saying: </p>
<p align="left">"When one holds power in one's hand, and when one holds it 
formally for quite a long time, you get used to considering it as something you 
are entitled to have. . . What I am interested in is what you can do with power. 
 You can make marvelous things with it, believe me". </p>
<p align="left">     Increasing concern over the amount of power Kissinger 
possessed, however, caused the Secretary of State to doff his other hat, that as 
director of the National Security Council, last year.  But the fact that the NSC 
directorship passed to a long-time Kissinger protege, Lt. General Brent 
Scowcroft, makes the gesture virtually meaningless.  Senator Henry M. Jackson, a 
persistent Kissinger needler, noted that, "Despite the appearances, Kissinger 
will retain full control of the National Security Council". </p>
<p align="left">     And even ultra-Liberal Adlai Stevenson II, the junior 
Senator from Illinois, observed that "the change is only symbolic". </p>
<p align="left">     Ford's swift guarantee of Kissinger's continuance in the 
White House could only mean one thing:  the Grand Design remains in force.  The 
players might change, but the game is the same. </p>
<p align="left">     As election year 1976 began, candidate Ford's speeches 
sounded like replays of 1968 and 1972 -- warmed-over servings of Nixon 
"conservatism".  This was an indirect admission by The Powers That Be of the 
need to campaign on Middle American ideals, virtues, and traditions.   </p>
<p align="left">     Or, to put it another way, the only way to con Americans 
out of their heritage is to promise the Old Time Values while delivering the New 
World Order. </p>
<p align="left"> </p>
<p><b><a name="Chapter_Three__"><font size="5">Chapter Three </font></a></b></p>
<p align="left"><b>EXCERPTS: </b></p>
<p align="left">     It can hardly be surprising that Rockefeller's chief 
foreign policy adviser at the time, one Henry A. Kissinger, later arranged to 
move President Nixon toward just such accommodation and amalgamation with the 
Communist world." </p>
<p align="left">     Working very hard to implement the CFR's wishes, and hasten 
the day when its "New World Order" will be a frightening fact, is the man who 
was plucked from obscurity for just such a mission:  Henry A. Kissinger.  And 
having been made a superstar because of his reliability, Henry is unlikely to 
change sides now.  As we shall see, his record shows that he can accomplish 
wonders -- for his real masters in the Shadow Government." </p>
<p align="center"><a name="KISSINGER_AND_THE_SHADOW_GOVERNMENT__"><big><big>
KISSINGER AND THE SHADOW GOVERNMENT</big></big> </a></p>
<p align="left">     "Kissinger has grown up in the foreign policy group which 
revolves around the Council on Foreign Relations.  Here he came to know, and 
work with, the whole cluster of top men in banking and industry who make up the 
true core of the so-called 'Eastern Establishment'."  So says columnist Joseph 
Harsch, and of course, he should know, since he is a member of that selfsame CFR. 
  </p>
<p align="left">     So much does Kissinger owe to the Council on Foreign 
Relations that he said at a party honoring a retiring high official of the 
organization:  "You invented me". </p>
<p align="left">     Is it significant that the Council on Foreign Relations -- 
after this abbreviated as CFR -- invented Henry K?  It is if you want to 
understand how the executive branch of the American government is really run.
</p>
<p align="left">     The CFR, headed by David Rockefeller and under the control 
of his lieutenants, is America's "Shadow Government" or "Invisible Government". 
 Administrations, both Democrat and Republican, come and go, but as we shall 
see, the key appointments in both <i>always</i> go to members of the mysterious 
Council on Foreign Relations. </p>
<p align="left">     This organization, headquartered in New York City, is 
composed of an elite of approximately 1,600 of the nation's Establishment 
Insiders in the fields of hight finance, academics, politics, commerce, the 
foundations, and the communications media.  The names of most of its members are 
household words, but few ordinary Americans have ever heard of this 
organization.  Even fewer are aware of its goals. </p>
<p align="left">     Despite the fact that the key moguls of the mass media are 
members of the CFR, its first fifty years of existence went uncommented except 
for a single article in <i>Harper's</i>, a feature in the <i>Christian Science 
Monitor</i>, and an occasional perfunctory announcement in the New York Times.  
</p>
<p align="left">     Such anonymity can hardly be accidental -- especially when 
you realize that the membership of the Council on Foreign Relations includes top 
executives from the <i>New York Times</i>, the <i>Washington Post</i>, the <i>
Los Angeles Times</i>, the <i>Knight</i> newspaper chain, <i>NBC, CBS, Time, 
Life, Fortune, Business Week, U.S. News &amp; World Report</i>, and many others. </p>
<p align="left">     For several years now a handful of conservative authors has 
been laboring to expose the activities of the CFR.  Until recently these 
efforts, though cumulative, could be ignored.  Four years ago, however, it began 
to be apparent that George Wallace was planning to seize upon the Council as an 
electoral issue. </p>
<p align="left">     Obviously anticipating this, two very similar articles on 
the CFR appeared in the <i>New York Times </i>and N<i>ew York</i> magazine.  The 
strategy was to admit that the Council on Foreign Relations has long acted as an 
unelected secret government of the United States, but to maintain that it has 
voluntarily withdrawn to the sidelines for reasons of altruism. </p>
<p align="left">     Contrary to what the <i>Times </i>wanted its readers to 
believe, the CFR (with Kissinger in charge of American foreign policy) was just 
reaching its zenith of power.  Still, as John Franklin Campbell put it in <i>New 
York </i>for September 20, 1971: </p>
<blockquote>
<p align="left">     Practically every lawyer, banker, professor, general, 
	journalist and bureaucrat who has had any influence on the foreign policy of 
	the last six Presidents -- From Franklin Roosevelt to Richard Nixon -- has 
	spent some time in the Harold Pratt House, a four-story mansion on the 
	corner of Park Avenue and 68th Street, donated 26 years ago by Mr. Pratt's 
	widow (an heir to the Standard Oil fortune) to the Council on Foreign 
	Relations, Inc. . . </p>
<p align="left">     If you can walk -- or be carried -- into the Pratt 
	House, it usually means that you are a partner in an investment bank or law 
	firm -- with occasional "trouble-shooting" assignments in government.  You 
	believe in foreign aid, NATO, and a bipartisan foreign policy.  You've been 
	pretty much running things in this country for the last 25 years, and you 
	know it. </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left">     Anthony Lukas, writing in the New York Times magazine of 
November 21, 1971, also admitted that the Insiders of the Council have been 
responsible for our disastrous foreign policy over the past twenty-five years. 
 Mr. Lukas observed: </p>
<blockquote>
<p align="left">     From 1945 well into the sixties, Council members were 
	in the forefront of America's globalist activism:  the United Nations 
	organizational meeting in San Francisco (John McCloy, Hamilton Fish 
	Armstrong, Joseph Johnson, Thomas Finletter and many others); as ambassadors 
	to the world body (Edward Stettinius, Henry Cabot Lodge, James Wadsworth and 
	all but three others); the U.S. occupation in Germany (Lucius Clay as 
	military governor, McCloy again and James Conant as High Commissioners); 
	NATO (Finletter again, Harland Cleveland, Charles Spofford as U.S. 
	delegates). </p>
<p align="left">     For the last three decades, American foreign policy has 
	remained largely in the hands of men -- the overwhelming majority of them 
	Council members -- whose world perspective was formed in World War II and in 
	the economic reconstructions and military security programs that followed. . 
	. </p>
<p align="left">     The Council was their way of staying in touch with the 
	levels of power. . . </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left">     Liberal columnist Joseph Kraft, himself a member of the CFR, 
noted in <i>Harper's </i>for July of 1958 that the Council "has been the seat 
of. . . basic government decisions, has set the context for many more, and has 
repeatedly served as a recruiting ground for ranking officials."  Kraft, 
incidentally, called his article "School For Statesmen" -- an admission that the 
members of the Council are drilled with a "Line" of strategy to be carried out 
in Washington. </p>
<p align="left">     In <i>New York magazine,</i> Campbell tells of CFR 
influence in World War II and in post-war planning: </p>
<blockquote>
<p align="left">     In 1939, with Rockefeller money and the blessings of 
	Secretary of State Cordell Hull, the Council established planning groups on 
	political, economic and strategic problems of the war, which, in 1942, were 
	transferred along with most of their personnel directly into the State 
	Department. </p>
<p align="left">     Many of their studies which culminated in the new 
	international institutions of 1945 -- the United Nations, the World Bank, 
	and the International Monetary Fund -- began as research efforts at the 
	Council. </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left">     When he was chairman of the board of the Council, John J. 
McCloy wrote a private letter to its members in which he euphemized that </p>
<blockquote>
<p align="left">"The Council -- more than any other organization in the 
	foreign field -- has helped leading private citizens to gain an 
	understanding of international problems, and many of them have subsequently 
	used this knowledge as government officials responsible for carrying out 
	United States foreign policy". </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left">     Indeed, the CFR has served as a virtual employment agency 
for the federal government under both Democrats and Republicans.  The <i>
Christian Science Monitor</i> report back in September 1961 confirmed this 
conclusion: </p>
<blockquote>
<p align="left">     Because of the Council's single-minded dedication to 
	studying and deliberating American foreign policy, there is a constant flow 
	of its members from private to public service.  Almost half of the Council 
	members have been invited to assume official government positions or to act 
	as consultants at one time or another. </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left">     Anthony Lukas comments in the <i>New York Times</i> 
magazine: </p>
<blockquote>
<p align="left">     . . . Everyone knows how fraternity brothers can help 
	other brothers climb the ladder of life.  If you want to make foreign 
	policy, there's no better fraternity to belong to than the Council . . . </p>
<p align="left">     When Henry Stimson -- the group's quintessential member 
	-- went to Washington in 1940 as Secretary of War, he took with him John 
	McCloy, who was to become Assistant Secretary in charge of personnel.  McCloy 
	has recalled "Whenever we needed a man we thumbed through the roll of the 
	Council members and put through a call to New York". </p>
<p align="left">     And over the years, the men McCloy called in turn 
	called other Council members. . . Of the first 82 names on a list prepared 
	to help President Kennedy staff his State Department, 63 were Council 
	members. . . </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left">     Indeed, the CFR provided the key men, particularly in the 
field of foreign policy, for the Roosevelt, Truman, Eisenhower, Kennedy, 
Johnson, Nixon, and now Ford Administrations.  As Joseph Kraft phrased it: </p>
<blockquote>
<p align="left">"the Council plays a special part in helping to bridge the 
	gap between the two parties, affording unofficially a measure of continuity 
	when the guard changes in Washington." </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left">     The following prominent Democrats have been, or now are, 
agents of the Council on Foreign Relations:  Dean Acheson, Alger Hiss, Adlai 
Stevenson, John Kennedy, Robert Kennedy, Edward Kennedy (Boston Committee), 
Averell Harriman, George Ball, Henry Fowler, Dean Rusk, Adam Yarmolinsky, Hubert 
Humphrey, Frank Church, George McGovern and John Lindsay.   </p>
<p align="left">     Holding the fort for the CFR in the Republican Party have 
been Dwight Eisenhower, John Foster Dulles, Thomas E. Dewey, Jacob Javits, 
Robert McNamara, Henry Cabot Lodge, Paul Hoffman, John Gardner, the 
Rockefellers, Elliot Richardson, Arthur Burns and Richard Nixon. </p>
<p align="left">     The <i>policy-making</i> power of the CFR is absolutely 
awesome and yet remains, strangely, virtually unknown to the American public. 
</p>
<p align="left">     <i>Every</i> Secretary of State from 1934 to 1976 [in an 
unbroken line to the present - 2002] (except James Byrnes) has been a member of 
the Council, as has every Secretary of Defense and every Deputy Secretary of 
Defense. </p>
<p align="left">     In the 44 years from 1928 to 1972, nine out of ten 
Republican presidential nominees were CFR members, and from 1952 to 1972 a CFR 
member won every presidential election (except Lyndon Johnson, whose White House 
staff was nonetheless CFR-dominated). </p>
<p align="left">     In half of the presidential campaigns during those same two 
decades, <i>both</i> candidates had been or were CFR members.  More than 40 CFR 
members were among the U.S. delegation to the first United Nations conference in 
San Francisco, including Soviet agent Alger Hiss. </p>
<p align="left">     In the Kennedy-Johnson Administrations, more than 60 CFR 
members held major policy-making decisions. President Nixon appointed at least 
115 members of the Council on Foreign Relations to key posts in his 
Administration, an all-time high for any President.  These included such 
established Leftists as Charles Yost, Stanley R. Resor, Arthur Burns, Harold 
Brown, Maxwell Taylor, Lincoln Bloomfield, George A. Lincoln, Henry Cabot Lodge, 
Robert Murphy, Dr. Frank Stanton, Richard F. Pederson, Alan Pifer, Dr. Paul 
McCracken, Ellsworth Bunker, Dr. Glenn Seaborg, Joseph Sisco, Jacob Beam, Gerard 
Smith, and John McCloy. </p>
<p align="left">     George Wallace made famous the slogan that at the 
Presidential level there is not a dime's worth of difference between the 
Democrat and Republican parties.  Many observers have noted that while the two 
parties use different rhetoric and aim their spiels at differing segments of the 
population, it seems to make little difference who wins the election. </p>
<p align="left">   The reason for this is that while grass roots Democrats and 
Republicans generally have greatly differing views on the economy, political 
policies, and federal activities, as you climb the sides of the political 
pyramid the two parties become more and more alike. The reason there isn't a 
dime's worth of difference is that instead of having two distinctly different 
groups called Democrats and Republicans, we actually have Rockedems and 
Rockepubs. </p>
<p align="left">     Of some 1,600 CFR members, 120 either own or control the 
nation's major newspapers, magazines, radio and television networks, as well as 
the most powerful book-publishing companies. The interlock with academia is 
immense. </p>
<p align="left">   As the Schlafly-Ward writing team has noted: </p>
<blockquote>
<p align="left">"The Rockefeller clique includes the most influential of the 
	82 CFR foundation-administration types who have disproportionate influence 
	on what is taught in our universities and over professorial and department 
	appointments." </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left">     Plus, CFR members virtually control the major foundations, 
whose grants quite often are bestowed on persons or groups tied to the CFR. 
 With this group, the "coincidences" are simply astounding. </p>
<p align="left">     The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) has been under 
virtual CFR control since its creation.  Even though James R. Schlesinger, who 
briefly headed it in 1973, was not a CFR member, he was a protege of CFR man 
Daniel Ellsberg of "Pentagon Papers" fame, and his appointment was manipulated 
by the key CFR operative, Henry Kissinger. </p>
<p align="left">     Secretaries of State Dean Acheson, John Foster Dulles, Dean 
Rusk, and Henry Kissinger <i>all </i>were CFR members -- all, in fact, worked 
directly for the House of Rockefeller -- before their appointments to major 
federal posts. </p>
<p align="left">     The balance of the CFR elitist clique is predominantly the 
big money boys.  Of the CFR's 1974 membership, about 90 represented the major 
Wall Street international banking organizations.  In addition, presidents, 
vice-presidents and chairmen of the boards of most of the giant corporations are 
members of the CFR. </p>
<p align="left">     The Council on Foreign Relations gets little publicity and 
is virtually unknown to the general public.  But it represents Big Government, 
Big Business, Big Banking, and the Big Media.  At the apex of this power elite 
sits none other than David Rockefeller.  And remember, this is the organization 
which Henry says "invented" him. </p>
<p align="left">    Nobody can rationally deny that "our" government has been 
run by CFR members for many years.  They indeed form a shadow government.  The 
question is: Do these CFR members generally share common beliefs and goals? </p>
<p align="left">     For the first time we now have an actual member of the CFR 
who is willing to testify against the organization.  He is Admiral Chester Ward, 
U.S. Navy (Ret.), who as a hot-shot youngish Admiral had become Judge Advocate 
General of the Navy.  As a "man on the rise" he was invited to become a member 
of the prestigious CFR.  The Establishment obviously assumed that Admiral Ward, 
like so many hundreds before him, would succumb to the flattery of being invited 
into the inner sanctum and that through subtle appeals to personal ambition he 
would quickly fall in line. </p>
<p align="left">     The Insiders badly underestimated the toughness and stern 
character of Admiral Ward.  He soon became a vocal opponent of the organization. 
 And while the Rockefellers were not so gauche as to remove him from the rolls 
of the organization, he is no longer invited to attend the private luncheons and 
briefing sessions.  The Admiral states: </p>
<p align="left">     The objective of the influential majority of members of CFR 
has not changed since its founding in 1922, more than 50 years ago.  In the 50th 
anniversary issue of <i>Foreign Affairs</i> (the official quarterly publication 
of the CFR), the first and leading article was written by CFR member Kingman 
Brewster, Jr., entitled "Reflections on Our National Purpose". </p>
<p align="left">     He did not back away from defining it:  our national 
purpose should be to abolish our nationality.  Indeed, he pulled out all the 
emotional stops in a hardsell for global government.  He described our 
"Vietnam-seared generation" as being "far from America Firsters" -- an 
expression meant as a patronizing sop to our young people.  In the entire CFR 
lexicon, there is no term of revulsion carrying a meaning so deep as "America 
First". </p>
<p align="left">     While CFR members are not robots and may disagree on many 
minor matters, according to the Admiral, this <i>lust to surrender</i> our 
independence is common to most of them: </p>
<blockquote>
<p align="left">"Although, from the inside, CFR is certainly not the 
	monolith that some members and most nonmembers consider it, this lust to 
	surrender the sovereignty and independence of the United States is pervasive 
	throughout most of the membership, and particularly in the leadership of the 
	several divergent cliques. . . " </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left">     If the Rockefeller family's CFR has a "lust to surrender 
the sovereignty and independence of the United States", to whom are we supposed 
to surrender? </p>
<p align="left">     Admiral Ward answers that the goal is the "submergence of 
U.S. sovereignty and national independence into an all-powerful one-world 
government".  And, according to the Admiral, about 95 percent of the 1,600 
members of the CFR are aware that this is the real purpose of the Council -- and 
support that goal! </p>
<p align="left">     The Council on Foreign Relations is the chief tool of the 
Money Trust in promoting World Government.  The late James Warburg (CFR), scion 
of the international banking family which was principally responsible for the 
creation of the Federal Reserve System that controls our money, told a Senate 
Committee on February 17, 1950: </p>
<blockquote>
<p align="left">"We shall have world government whether or not you like it 
	-- by conquest or consent." </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left">     Most Insiders, however, avoid using the term World 
Government because it frightens the geese; instead they use code phrases like 
"new international order" or "new world order".  But Nelson Rockefeller spelled 
out quite clearly what the Insiders mean by "new world order" in this <i>
Associated Press </i>report dated July 26, 1968: </p>
<blockquote>
<p align="left">"New York Governor Nelson A. Rockefeller says as president 
	he would work toward international creation of a 'new world order' based on 
	East-West cooperation instead of conflict.  The republican presidential 
	contender said he would begin a dialogue with Red China, if elected, to 
	'improve the possibilities of accommodations' with that country 'as well as 
	the Soviet Union'." </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left">     It can hardly be surprising that Rockefeller's chief 
foreign policy adviser at the time, one Henry A. Kissinger, later arranged to 
move President Nixon toward just such accommodation and amalgamation with the 
Communist world. </p>
<p align="left">     During his trips to both Red China and U.S.S.R., again and 
again Mr. Nixon called upon the Communists to join him in a "New World Order". 
 The constant repetition of that phrase by members of the CFR strains the 
possibility of coincidence. </p>
<p align="left">     Working very hard to implement the CFR's wishes, and hasten 
the day when its "New World Order" will be a frightening fact, is the man who 
was plucked from obscurity for just such a mission:  Henry A. Kissinger.  And 
having been made a superstar because of his reliability, Henry is unlikely to 
change sides now.  As we shall see, his record shows that he can accomplish 
wonders -- for his real masters in the Shadow Government. </p>

<p align="left">EXCERPTS: </p>
<p align="left">     But all of this was just the warm-up for the main event. 
 In the early '60s, Congress approved legislation creating something called the 
Arms Control and Disarmament Agency.  A program of "general and complete 
disarmament" became the official policy of the United States.   </p>
<p align="left">     The entire sequence is a fascinating illustration of how 
the Shadow Government achieves its aims. The first serious disarmament proposal 
was produced by the Council on Foreign Relations in 1959.  The idea was then 
discussed at a Pugwash Conference, and, in September 1960, the soviets presented 
their own disarmament program.   </p>
<p align="left">     One year later, in September 1961, the Kennedy 
Administration issued its disarmament proposal, in State Department Publication 
7277, <font color="blue"><u>Freedom From War</u></font>.   </p>
<p align="left">     Now, <b>here is the clincher</b>:  all four proposals -- 
from the CFR, the Pugwash Conference, the Soviets, and the State Department -- 
are virtually identical!  For more details on this amazing "coincidence", see 
Chapter Eight of my previous book, <i>The Rockefeller File</i>."  </p>
<p align="center"><a name="DESTRUCTION_THROUGH_DETENTE__"><big><big>DESTRUCTION 
THROUGH <i>DETENTE</i></big></big> </a></p>
<p align="left">     As America's Bicentennial year began, Secretary of State 
Henry Kissinger could (and undoubtedly did) take pride in the fact that, almost 
single-handedly, he had sewn together a new foreign policy for America. Secret 
deal by secret deal, <i>detente</i> had become a reality. </p>
<p align="left">     But within a few months, the entire fabric was in danger of 
being torn to shreds.  There were violations and rumors of violations of the 
Strategic Arms Limitations Talks agreements; voices were heard loudly protesting 
that the United States was slipping (or may have already slipped) to number two 
in comparison with Soviet military strength; and other serious charges were 
aired. </p>
<p align="left">     In the face of mounting doubts and criticism that 
Kissinger's policies had been the best policies for America, President Ford 
tried to defuse discussion by simply dropping the word "<i>detente</i>" from the 
White House vocabulary.  Henceforth, members of the Ford Administration were 
told, the password is "peace through strength". </p>
<p align="left">     Kissinger was not happy with the decision, but agreed to go 
along with the verbal gymnastics during an election year.  After all, no one had 
suggested that the policies themselves be changed, merely the pet phrases used 
to describe them.  (According to <i>Time </i>magazine, Kissinger complained that 
the move represented "a petty capitulation to right-wing critics" on the part of 
the President). </p>
<p align="left">     <i>Detente</i> has been the foundation of <i>pax 
Kissingerae</i>, the very cornerstone of the policy Henry Kissinger packaged and 
sold to Presidents Nixon and Ford.  The word itself comes from the French and 
can mean either a "relaxation of tensions" or a "a trigger".  It was the first 
explanation that was sold to a trusting American public. </p>
<p align="left">     We were told that: "The Cold War is over" and "The 
Communists have mellowed".  Like small children, we were lectured, "It's time 
for a more mature relationship between countries".  And above all, we were 
promised that <i>detente </i>would mean a give-and-take, a fair exchange, 
acceptable accommodation by both sides.  In practice, <i>detente</i> turned out 
to be a one-way street benefiting only the Communists.  Consider: </p>
<p align="left">     In 1968, when the first SALT talks were scheduled, the 
United States possessed 1,054 intercontinental ballistic missiles; the Soviets 
had only 850.  By 1975, however, the Soviets had 1,618 long-range missiles 
deployed while we, in turn, still had 1,054.  In other words, a five-to-four 
American advantage had changed to an eight-to-five Soviet superiority.  And 
that's just the beginning. </p>
<p align="left">     During those same eight years, the Soviet armed forces had 
expanded from 1.8 million men to over 2.5 million.  Meanwhile, the United States 
was scuttling the draft and downgrading its own armed services; the result was a 
drop to military forces from 940,000 men in uniform to less than 790,000. </p>
<p align="left">     On the high seas, the Soviets maintain a flotilla of 253 
attack submarines, compared to 73 for the United States.  They have more than 
twice as many supply ships as we do -- 2,358 to 1,009.  And, Defense Secretary 
Donald Rumsfeld has estimated the Red lead in tactical aircraft at a ratio of 
nearly two-to-one. </p>
<p align="left">     The Soviet submarine fleet is larger than American, 
British, and French forces combined.  Moreover, the Communists now have the 
world's <i>largest </i>submarines, Delta-class vessels one and one-half times 
longer that a football field; each one is equipped with twelve tubes for firing 
nuclear missiles. (The missiles, incidentally, have a range of some 4,000 miles. 
 And with such subs now patrolling off our Atlantic, Pacific, and Gulf coasts, 
there is not a town in America that is not within range of Soviet nuclear 
missiles this very evening.) </p>
<p align="left">     Meanwhile, in this era of <i>detente</i>, other parts of 
our military arsenal are allowed to rust away.  Prior to the advent of Henry the 
K, the U.S. could deploy 434 major combat ships.  Today, that number has been 
cut almost in half, to only 253.  Even more alarming, Congressman Les Aspin told 
his colleagues in the House on February 3, 1976 that because of poor 
maintenance, only thirty percent of U.S. Navy vessels can meet "the standard of 
full combat readiness".  Moreover, the Congressman said, nearly half the Navy's 
7,400 aircraft are unprepared and unequipped for hostile action. </p>
<p align="left">     While British authority Captain John Moore, in the book <i>
The Soviet Navy Today </i>(published in January 1976), says that the Soviet 
Navy's firepower is "the most potent of any fleet that ever existed", the U.S. 
fleet is the smallest and weakest it has been at any time since 1939.  Moore 
estimates that the United States is presently at least seven to eight years 
behind the Communists, and we are falling further behind every week. </p>
<p align="left">     The Red Navy dominates the North Sea, patrols the Arctic 
and the Antarctic, is "strongly present" in the Atlantic and Pacific, controls 
Sweden's sea outlets of Skagerrak and Kattegat, and is heavily and visibly 
present in the Mediterranean and Arabian Seas, the Indian Ocean, the Persian 
Gulf, and off both coasts of Africa. </p>
<p align="left">     The Soviets scored a major victory in 1975 without flexing 
a muscle, when Henry the Knife ordered the $6 billion anti-ballistic missile 
defense complex in North Dakota shut down.  The ABM complex had been operational
<i>for only one month</i> when it was decided, in the spirit of <i>detente</i>, 
that it could be scrapped. </p>
<p align="left">     Coming at a time when the Russians were improving and 
modernizing their own anti-ballistic missile system, the move left the United 
States with no protection against Soviet or chinese missiles. Super K has 
already been quoted as saying that Red China and the Soviet Union are no longer 
"revolutionary" states.  As the Secretary sees it, the two Communist giants "no 
longer entertain ambitions to destroy the existing international order". </p>
<p align="left">     Soviet party chief Leonid Brezhnev has a slightly different 
perspective.  He told a meeting of the Politburo in 1974: </p>
<blockquote>
<p align="left">"We Communists have got to string along with the capitalists 
	for a while.  We need their agriculture and their technology.  But we are 
	going to continue massive military programs. . . (soon) we will be in a 
	position to return to a much more aggressive foreign policy designed to gain 
	the upper-hand. . . " </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left">     We do not believe that the United States must match the 
Soviets man for man, tank for tank, or even ship for ship in order to protect 
itself.  Today, technology is the equalizer that the Colt .45 was in the old 
West. </p>
<p align="left">     Possibly the ultimate equalizer, the one which could 
guarantee our safety, is the cruise missile.  This nuclear warhead is small 
enough to be launched from almost anywhere, powerful enough to fly 2,000 miles 
or more, and accurate enough to strike within 100 feet of its target. </p>
<p align="left">     Now, here is the punch line:  Henry Kissinger has offered 
to bargain away even this ultimate weapon at the SALT table! </p>
<p align="left">     Under the circumstances, it can come as no surprise that an 
analysis of our military preparedness, undertaken by the non-partisan Library of 
Congress, warns that the balance of military power is shifting strongly in favor 
of the Soviet Union.  The report was prepared for the Senate Armed Services 
Committee.  released to the public in February 1976, it states that unless 
current policies are reversed, the United States will have to reassess its 
position as a global power! </p>
<p align="left">     While the crippling of our military position by our 
detente-minded Secretary of State was becoming an open scandal in Washington, 
another shock wave hit the Capitol.  In late February 1976, it was confirmed 
that previous estimates by the CIA of Soviet military expenditures were fifty 
percent too low. </p>
<p align="left">     At the beginning of this election year, world renowned 
nuclear physicist Edward Teller warned that the United States was already a 
clear second to the Soviet Union in military strength.  "We would have no chance 
against Russia if there was a conflict now", he said.  Dr. Teller added he 
believed it would take us ten years to surpass the Soviets even if present 
policies are changed. </p>
<p align="left">      By now you may be asking, what in God's name has happened 
during the past eight years?  How did an eight-to-one American military 
superiority over the Communists vanish in less than a decade? </p>
<p align="left">     <i>Detente's </i>disastrous roots stretch back at least 
thirty years, to Yalta and similar post-World War II concessions to the 
Communists.  Trying to explain why he had been so incredibly generous to Soviet 
strongman Stalin, a sick and war-weary Franklin D. Roosevelt told our Ambassador 
to Moscow, William C. Bullitt: </p>
<blockquote>
<p align="left">"I have a hunch that Stalin. . . does not want anything but 
	security for his country, and I think that if I give him everything I 
	possibly can and ask for nothing from him in return, he won't try to annex 
	anything and he will work with me for a world of peace and harmony." </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left">     Roosevelt's wishful dream of "a world of peace and harmony" 
was forgotten during the Soviet conquest of Eastern Europe and the Communist 
chinese assault on Korea. </p>
<p align="left">{NOTE: Historical books that have been suppressed from the 
public are replete with accounts of FDR's treasonous actions dealing with the 
U.S.S.R.  That would belie a sentiment claiming he 'dreamed of a world of peace 
and harmony', other than the 'peace' sought by Zionist/Bolshevist Globalists: a 
world without resistance to their planned tyrannical World Government. - JP - 
transcriber} </p>
<p align="left">     But by the mid-1950s the peacemongers were setting up shop 
once again.  One of the most important operations was something known as the 
Pugwash Conferences.  Officially described as "Joint Conferences on Science and 
World Affairs" between Russian and American scientists and intellectuals, the 
first meeting took place in 1957 at the Pugwash, Nova Scotia home of the 
notorious Soviet apologist, Cyrus Eaton. </p>
<p align="left">     Since then, more than twenty "Pugwash Conferences" have 
been held, most of them outside the United States and all of them financed by 
the tax-exempt Rockefeller-CFR foundations.  An active participant in those 
early meetings was Henry A. Kissinger. </p>
<p align="left">     The Pugwash Conferences did not push <i>detente</i>, but 
only because the word had not been coined back then.  The pet phrase of the 
conferees was "disarmament". It was at these meetings that the framework for the 
Nuclear Test Ban Treaty was constructed.   </p>
<p align="left">     Remember the first test Ban Treaty?  The Soviets signed it 
and paid lip service to it for almost a year -- while they made secret 
preparations for the mightiest series of nuclear tests they had ever conducted. 
 While most Americans were still in shock because of the Communists' blatant 
deceit, another test ban treaty was prepared in 1963.  This one froze the 
advantages that the Soviets had gained by betraying the first one -- and 
guaranteed that the United States would not conduct additional nuclear tests.
</p>
<p align="left">     Over vociferous protests from countless Americans, the 
United States signed the second Nuclear Test Ban Treaty as well.  Professor 
Kissinger and his crowd were delighted. </p>
<p align="left">     But all of this was just the warm-up for the main event. 
 In the early '60s, Congress approved legislation creating something called the 
Arms Control and Disarmament Agency.  A program of "general and complete

<p align="left">     The first Secretary of Defense to implement this policy was 
CFR member Robert S. McNamara, who held office from 1961 through 1968.  During 
that time, he succeeded in reducing our nuclear striking force by fifty percent; 
scrapping three-quarters of our multi-megaton missiles and half of the Minuteman 
missiles; blocking development of the B-70 strategic bomber after it had proven 
its effectiveness; cancelling the Skybold, Pluto, Dynasoar, and Orion missile 
systems; and mothballing much of the sea and air fleets he inherited. </p>
<p align="left">     In fact, McNamara destroyed more operational U.S. strategic 
weapons than the Soviets could have destroyed in a full-scale nuclear attack!
</p>
<p align="left">{NOTE:  It was also McNamara who recalled (three times) the 
fighter jets sent out from the USS. Saratoga to come to the aide of their 
brothers on the USS Liberty when they and it were attacked by the Israelis 
during the six-day war in 1967. Because of McNamara's orders 34 American sailors 
were killed; over 170 were injured and maimed; the ship was damaged beyond 
repair. - JP - transcriber} </p>
<p align="left">     All of these accomplishments would pale in comparison to 
what Henry the K would accomplish for the disarmament lobby during the next 
eight years, however.  The intellectual with the heavy accent and even heavier 
connections had come a long way, baby, since those first Pugwash Conferences.
</p>
<p align="left">     The Strategic Arms Limitations Talks, or SALT 1, were 
Henry's first big opportunity.  Curiously, had it not been for the Soviet 
invasion of Czechoslovakia, the talks would have been over before he was in 
office.  The first SALT conference was originally scheduled to be held in July 
1968.  When Soviet tanks rumbled into Czechoslovakia, however, to crush the 
"liberal spring" of Alexander Dubcek (only two weeks after Soviet officials had 
signed the Declaration of Bratislava, guaranteeing Czech independence!), it was 
decided to postpone the SALT meetings until November 1969. </p>
<p align="left">     Having gotten his big chance, Henry was not going to let 
anyone else interfere with his operation.  At the SALT talks, Henry the K no 
longer was an understudy.  Suddenly he had a starring role.  And he was not 
about to let anyone else share the spotlight with him. </p>
<p align="left">     In his book <i>Cold Dawn</i>, the behind-the-scenes story 
of SALT, John Newhouse portrays Kissinger as secrecy obsessed, suspicious of his 
own staff, and constantly scheming to grasp more power and control over other 
positions and personnel.  Ultimately, Henry the Knife would successfully emerge 
as the <i>sole</i> American architect of SALT. </p>
<p align="left">     Even such long-time and influential Liberals as Paul Nitze 
and Gerard Smith found it impossible to get along with fellow-CFR member 
Kissinger.  Nitze, the senior delegate at earlier SALT conferences, had such 
serious disputes with Kissinger that he quit the delegations.  Smith, head of 
the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, had been the chief U.S. arms negotiator 
before Kissinger came along.   </p>
<p align="left">     When Henry did not even consult with him during the last 
twenty days of negotiations -- preferring secret deals directly with the Soviets 
-- Smith blew his top.  But in the end, it was Smith, not Kissinger, who was 
"retired" from his position. In short, at SALT it was Henry Kissinger, and no 
one else, who arranged America's terms.  Just what kind of a deal did he 
endorse?  In their exhaustive 800-page analysis, <i>Kissinger on the Couch</i>, 
authors Phyllis Schlafly and Chester Ward say that SALT 1 was incredibly slanted 
to favor the Soviets: </p>
<blockquote>
<p align="left">     Every single key provision of both SALT agreements 
	originated with Soviet strategic experts and planners in the Kremlin, was 
	approved by Leonid Brezhnev and his closest associates in the Politburo, and 
	was passed -- usually by Soviet Ambassador Anatoly. dobrynin --to Henry 
	Kissinger, who then provided the rationalization for it and "sold" it to 
	President Nixon. </p>
<p align="left">     Kissinger not only accepted Soviet dictation of all the 
	key provisions of the agreements, but sold them to President Nixon and the 
	nation by providing rationalizations he knew were misleading.  That is to 
	say, he was working with the Soviets and against the United States of 
	America.  He was deliberately and elaborately deceiving the American people, 
	Congress, and probably the President with his cunning charade. . . </p>
<p align="left">     All the substantive provisions of both, SALT ! 
	agreements were in fact dictated by the Kremlin and secretly accepted by 
	Henry Kissinger without the participation of the U.S. SALT delegation. </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left">     Just how bad were the SALT agreements?  Unless you are a 
paranoid masochist, with a secret lust to see this Republic destroyed, they are 
a <i>disaster</i>.  The SALT 1 Treaty, which Henry the K so proudly exhibited, 
granted the Soviets a 41-percent superiority in land-based missiles, a 
94-percent superiority in sea-based missiles, and a 50-percent superiority in 
submarines. </p>
<p align="left">      Senators Barry goldwater and John Tower joined other 
legislators in warning that the agreements <i>guarantee </i>the Communists a 
four-to-one advantage over the U.S. in missile payload capability;  permit the 
Reds to continue building nuclear submarines while blocking us from doing the 
same; and, assure the Soviets of a three-to-two advantage in the number of 
missiles deployed. </p>
<p align="left">     General Bruce K. Holloway, former Commander-in-Chief of the 
Strategic Air Command, stated in 1971 that "The U.S.S.R. exceeds us in every 
offensive and defensive strategic weapon system, except missile submarines." 
 This one slight advantage is rapidly disappearing, thanks to Secretary 
Kissinger. </p>
<p align="left">     Even though the SALT 1 accord was slanted in the Soviets' 
favor on every important point, apparently this was not enough for the 
Communists.  For the signatures of the signers barely had time to dry before 
reports began leaking out of Washington that the Russians, once again, were 
cheating. </p>
<p align="left">     The only surprise would have been if the Communists had 
kept their word.  Out of seventeen previous agreements with the U.S. relating to 
arms and defense, the Soviets have broken every single one. </p>
<p align="left">     The big story, however, was not that the Communists had 
violated yet another agreement -- such disparate sources as muckraking columnist 
Jack Anderson and the respected trade journal <i>Aviation Week &amp; Space 
Technology</i> agreed on that -- but that Secretary of State Henry Kissinger was 
deceiving the public, and perhaps even the President, about such violations. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p align="left">Former chief of Naval Operations, Admiral Elmo R. Zumwalt 
	Jr., a vocal and persistent critic of detente, charged that Kissinger:  </p></li>
<li>
<p align="left">Withheld from the Congress at least five intelligence 
	reports of possible Soviet violations; </p></li>
<li>
<p align="left">Instructed intelligence officials to avoid any written 
	statements that could be interpreted as suggesting the Communists had 
	violated the agreements' </p></li>
<li>
<p align="left">Deliberately misled then-Secretary of State William P. 
	Rogers about the nature and extent of Soviet abuses of the SALT agreement;
	</p></li>
<li>
<p align="left">Ordered the Voice of America to edit out of its Eastern 
	European broadcasts anything unfavorable to the soviet Union; </p></li>
<li>
<p align="left">Carried on secret discussions with soviet officials 
	regarding "loopholes" in the present accords as well as plans for future 
	disarmament measures; </p></li>
<li>
<p align="left">Persuaded President Ford to claim that the Standing 
	Consultative Group, established under the SALT 1 pact, would investigate any 
	complaints of violations, although as chief negotiator of the agreement he 
	knew that the group could do no such thing. </p></li>
</ul>
<p align="left">     "The Soviets have violated the basic contracts, the 
attached protocols, the agreed interpretations, and the unilateral 
declarations", Zumwalt charged. "The U.S. has protested to the SCG.  That group 
-- the President's answer notwithstanding -- is not an investigative or 
fact-finding body, nor can it form conclusions about violations. . . The 
evidence from the intelligence community is inarguable. . . the Soviets have 
lied to us." </p>
<p align="left">     According to the Admiral, it is not just the Soviets who 
deliberately distort the truth.  In February 1976, the San Francisco Chronicle 
carried some major revelations by Zumwalt of conversations he had with Kissinger 
six years earlier.  In notes he made at the time, Admiral Zumwalt wrote: </p>
<blockquote>
<p align="left">"K feels the U.S. has passed its historic high point like so 
	many earlier civilizations.  He believes the U.S. is on the downhill. . .
	</p>
<p align="left">He states that his job is to persuade the Russians to give 
	us the best deal we can get, recognizing that the historical forces favor 
	them.  He says that in the light of history, he will be recognized as one of 
	those who negotiated terms favorable to the Soviets, but that the American 
	people have only themselves to blame because they lack the stamina to stay 
	the course against the Russians, who are Sparta to our Athens." </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left">     The Secretary of State branded Zumwalt's revelations as 
"contemptible falsehoods". The Admiral responded: "Kissinger's answer is just 
one more indication that liars lie." </p>
<p align="left">     If we score each year of the Kissinger Era as one round in 
the match between the U.S. and the U.S.S.R., the total in this Bicentennial 
election year stands at East 8, West 0.  In Germany, the 1970 treaties with 
Russia and Poland negotiated by Willi Brandt and the 1971 agreement on Berlin 
were clear victories for the Communists.  In conferences involving Warsaw Pact 
and NATO forces, the Soviet bloc almost without exception has come out ahead. 
 In terms of aid and trade, the Communists have made out like the bandits they 
are.  And in discussions of arms limitations, as we have seen, <i>pax 
Kissingerae </i>has meant a clean sweep for the Communists. </p>
<p align="left">    Perhaps the Reds' clearest victory, at least 
psychologically, occurred in Helsinki, Finland in July 1975, when President 
Ford, on behalf of the United States, signed a document supposedly drafted by 
the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, but actually prepared by 
Henry Kissinger and his soviet comrades.   </p>
<p align="left">     The Helsinki Declaration is nothing less than a complete 
and shameful betrayal of Soviet-occupied Eastern Europe.  It sanctions the rape 
of Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Czechoslovakia, and the other Soviet 
satellites.  It puts the U.S. stamp of approval on the Communist conquest of 
one-half of Europe. </p>
<p align="left">     Meanwhile, Dr. Kissinger has managed to eliminate any 
opposition within the Executive Branch to his plans for a New World Order.  And 
he is not always very subtle about it.  When Admiral Zumwalt was invited to 
appear on "Meet The Press" two years ago [1975], Kissinger (operating through 
Defense Secretary James Schlesinger) ordered the Admiral not to participate in 
the panel show. </p>
<p align="left">     When Zumwalt pointed out that he had retired from the 
government and was not subject to Dr. K.'s commands, Henry the Knife then 
threatened to have him court-martialed.  A compromise was finally reached, 
permitting Zumwalt to appear as scheduled, so long as he promised <i>not </i>to 
discuss the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks. </p>
<p align="left">     Schlesinger himself did not last long enough at the 
Pentagon to gain any seniority.  He was fired by President Ford in November 1975 
because of "growing tensions" between himself and the Secretary of State.  A few 
days later, Kissinger's satisfied smirk must have spread when he learned that 
Lt. Gen. Daniel O. Graham, Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, had also 
submitted his resignation.   </p>
<p align="left">     While neither Schlesinger or Graham could be described as 
hard-nosed conservatives, both men had expressed serious reservations about <i>
detente</i>, and both men were openly alarmed about the Soviets' massive 
military build-up.  But apparently the watchword in Washington is, "You don't 
have to agree with everything Super K does; just don't <i>disagree </i>with 
anything!" </p>
<p align="left">     Meanwhile, the Soviets continue to increase their military 
posture at a furious pace.  Malcolm R. currie, a director of research for the 
Defense Department, told a Senate Committee in February 1976 that the Communists 
have launched "a large and determined effort, and the Soviets are inexorably 
increasing their level of technology. . . " </p>
<p align="left">     Currie cited the following Soviet gains during the past 
year: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p align="left">Rapid progress in high-accuracy guidance for new 
	intercontinental ballistic missiles; </p></li>
<li>
<p align="left">Intensive research in an anti-ballistic missile program;
	</p></li>
<li>
<p align="left">New developments in underseas surveillance and strategic air 
	defense systems; </p></li>
<li>
<p align="left">An aggressive space program that saw the Russians launch 
	eight times more military spacecraft in 1975 than the United States did;
	</p></li>
<li>
<p align="left">Development of two new kinds of satellites for ocean 
	surveillance, "possibly to provide targeting information for attack 
	submarines and guided-missile ships". </p></li>
</ul>
<p align="left">     In other words, while the United States has stood still 
(and in some areas has slipped backwards), the Soviets have been aggressively 
moving forward.  The situation has become so critical that the normally 
restrained writing team of Admiral Chester Ward and Phyllis Schlafly have 
accused Henry Kissinger of making "the entire population of the United States 
hostages to the Kremlin". </p>
<p align="left">     Unless our egotistical and surrender-prone Secretary of 
State is stopped, they warn, "We will have been set up for mass murder on a 
scale never before witnessed in the history of the world." </p>
<p align="left">     Although we certainly do not question the facts that 
Admiral Ward and Mrs. Schlafly have assembled, we do not share their 
conclusions.  While it is possible that Henry the K is setting us up for nuclear 
annihilation, we think it is far more probable that the real purpose is not 
nuclear bombs, but nuclear blackmail.   </p>
<p align="left">     Why is the United States being disarmed?  The answer, we 
believe, is that the way is being prepared for a New World Order ultimatum.  It 
will be hailed as "the best deal we can get" by Kissinger and the network media 
boys -- who have remained deaf, dumb, and blind while the situation was being 
set up. The Communists are working hand-in-hand with internationalists in our 
own country. </p>
<p align="left">     When the former are strong enough, thanks to Henry K, the 
latter (led, not so coincidentally, by Henry K) will insist we must scrap our 
national sovereignty and merge into a One World Government.   </p>
<p align="left">     The entire scenario is in keeping with a statement made to 
the Senate Foreign Relations Committee more than twenty-five years ago by 
international banker and CFR potentate James Warburg.  He said, "We will have 
world government whether or not you like it -- by conquest or consent." </p>
<p align="left">     The Shadow Government has been working for just such a 
conclusion to American independence for many years.  It would not be accurate to 
blame Henry Kissinger for creating all of these policies; he has simply been the 
master architect in finalizing the destruction of our defensive capability.  He 
is the undisputed champion of creating, crafting and selling the disarmament of 
the United States in what he believes will be the final period of our 
independence. </p>
<p align="left">     But disarming the United States is only half of the plot. 
 Just as significant, and even less publicized, is the lengthy history of 
Western aid to the Soviet Union, which began almost as soon as the Bolsheviks 
seized power.  It is not the purpose of this volume to substantiate how the 
West, particularly the United States, literally has created the 
industrial-military complex of the Soviet Union. </p>
<p align="left">     The fascinating, almost unbelievable saga has been 
chronicled elsewhere.  (See "Building the Big Red Machine" in the author's 
previous book, <i>The Rockefeller File</i>, as well as the series of important 
studies on this subject by Professor Antony C. Sutton.) </p>
<p align="left">     The point was driven home with cruel irony during the 
Vietnam War, when the Soviet bloc provided 80 percent of the war materials for 
North Vietnam -- materials that were used against Americans and South Vietnamese 
in the field at the very time American supplies were being unloaded at Soviet 
ports and the U.S. was helping construct the largest truck-building complex in 
the world in Russia! </p>
<p align="left">     Thousands of items with strategic applications were cleared 
for shipment to the Communists while U.S. credits, subsidized by taxpayers, 
financed the purchases. </p>
<p align="left">     The Soviet Union, in the era of detente as before, has 
needed Western technology and Western foodstuffs to survive.  It has been 
getting both, largely through the ingenious method of having the U.S. taxpayers 
finance the long-term, low-interest loans necessary so the Russians could 
purchase such goods.   </p>
<p align="left">     The Export-Import Bank (ExIM) has loaned the Soviets 
hundreds of millions of dollars and Senator Harry F. Byrd of Virginia has 
warned, "It appears that loans in the billions are in the works". </p>
<p align="left">     While Americans must pay ten percent, twelve percent, or 
more for loans, ExIm lends the Reds money at six percent interest.  The banks 
handling the deals, and the businessmen selling the goods, make a windfall, but 
it is the American citizens ultimately who pay the cost.  The industrialization 
of Communist Russia has, in no small part, been financed by U.S. taxpayers 
precisely in this fashion. </p>
<p align="left">     The fact that the Soviet Union exceeds the U.S. in steel 
output is in no small part due to the investments there by U.s. and other Free 
World firms.  The largest iron and steel plant in the world was built in the 
U.S.S.R. by the American-based McKee Corporation.  The Soviet Union is now the 
world's major producer of oil, due to the development of the Russian oil and gas 
potential by Western, primarily American, interests. </p>
<p align="left">     During the past three years, while Soviet-supplied forces 
were completing their conquest of Southeast Asia, the United States was building 
the largest truck factory in the world -- on the Kama River in Russia. During 
the same time we were financing, building and equipping the largest tanker 
shipyard in the world. . . on the Black Sea; the largest fertilizer complex in 
the world. . . on the Volga River; and a very large chemical plant -- at 
Severondenetz. </p>
<p align="left">     In April 1975 the Ford Administration actually licensed the 
sale to the Soviet Union of eleven advanced-design giant IBM computers.  Within 
days of this deal, it was announced that a bank consortium (made up of the cream 
of CFR-connected wheelers and dealers) was lending the Soviet Union $250 million 
"with no strings attached to the loan". </p>
<p align="left">     And that very same day, Bank of America announced it had 
another syndicate ready to lend the U.S.S.R. $500 million.  Do you begin to 
detect a pattern in all of this? </p>
<p align="left">     Secretary of State Kissinger acknowledged the obvious last 
year when he said that "the Soviet Union is much more interested in credits than 
in trade, because for the next five years Russia will have little to give in 
reciprocal trade". </p>
<p align="left">     What Henry didn't way was that, given past performances, 
the Soviet Union had everything to gain and nothing to lose by such deals. 
 After all, it was <i>detente</i>-minded boys in the State Department who 
earlier had agreed to allow the Soviets to pay off an $11 billion World War II 
Lend-Lease debt for a mere $722 million, or seven cents on the dollar.  True to 
form, the Communists paid only $32 million, then reneged on the rest. </p>
<p align="left">     Admiral Elmo zumwalt has described the situation in this 
hardly flattering but frankly accurate passage: </p>
<p align="left">     "The Soviets see the United States right now as a great 
placid bovine chewing its cud in the sun and with two huge udders extended to 
them, one labeled grain and the other labeled technology.  It stands there 
letting itself be milked dry, twitching its tail contentedly, too lazy and too 
placid to notice." </p>
<p align="left">      Of the myriad deals Herr Kissinger has arranged for his 
Soviet friends in the past eight years, only one almost became a public scandal. 
 It wasn't all that more important than the Secretary's other pacts and 
promises, it was just a lot more obvious. </p>
<p align="left">     We're referring, of course, to the "great grain robbery" of 
1972.  It was a performance that made the Brink's robbery seem like a 
kindergarten heist of four marbles and one slightly licked lollipop. </p>
<p align="left">     Before most Americans knew what was happening, the Soviets 
had purchased a whopping twenty-five percent of the U.S. wheat crop at 
bargain-basement prices.  The sale created a wheat shortage in the United 
States, with the result that bread prices suddenly shot through the ceiling. 
 But that was just part of the story.  We financed the loan, so the Soviets 
could make the purchase, and we also subsidized the freight to get the grain to 
them. </p>
<p align="left">     Kissinger followed up this Soviet success with a five-year 
agreement, signed in October 1975, which entitles the Soviets to buy a minimum 
of six million metric tons of U.S. grain annually, beginning with the 1976 crop 
year.  It is a "swap deal" -- we are supposed to keep the usually empty Soviet 
larder stocked, while in return the Soviets will sell us ten million metric tons 
of oil and oil products each year. </p>
<p align="left">     Part of the deal allows the Russians to buy up to seven 
million more tons of U.S. grain before the five-year agreement takes effect in 
the fall of 1976.  Oren Staley, President of the national Farmers Organization, 
called the deal an "outrageous interference with American farmers' free 
markets."  Staley said the agreement represented "government dictatorship with a 
vengeance" and added that American farmers have been "lied to, betrayed and sold 
down the river". </p>
<p align="left">     While russia was placing orders for American wheat, 
American corn, and American rice, food prices in the U.S. were rising 29 percent 
in two years.  Under the circumstances, it was indeed strange to see Kissinger 
and his cronies begging the Communists to cart away American grain. </p>
<p align="left">     But the madness of <i>detente</i> did not stop there.  By 
1975 it reached such ridiculous extremes as the U.S. government authorizing a 
private American firm to sell two sets of plans for a sophisticated new cargo 
ship to the Soviets for $500,000 each -- <i>after </i>the Defense Department had 
invested $57.5 million in the project. And on and on it goes. </p>
<p align="left">     Our Kissinger-arranged deals with Red China are cut from 
the same cloth as our "trade" with the Soviet bloc; we have made numerous 
concessions and have asked for none in return. </p>
<p align="left">     What does the building of the Big Red Machine in the Soviet 
Union and Red China mean?  Constructing some of the world's largest factories 
for the Soviet Union, and shipping them the most sophisticated U.S. technology 
and equipment, has many implications. </p>
<p align="left">     Professor Antony Sutton, the worlds' foremost expert on the 
use of Western technology to develop the Soviet Union, has written an entire 
book on this subject under the provocative but very deliberate title, <i>
National Suicide</i>. </p>
<p align="left">    The military potential of the industrial plants which we are 
building for the Soviets should be obvious to anyone.  Trucks, aircraft, oil, 
steel, petro-chemicals, aluminum, computers -- these are the very sinews of a 
military-industrial complex.  These factories, the product of American genius 
and financed by American capital, could have been built in the United States. 
 Instead, they are constructed <i>at U.S. taxpayers' expense</i> in the Soviet 
Union -- a nation whose masters still keep millions in concentration camps and 
who have sworn to bury us. </p>
<p align="left">     Another important thing to remember is the strong 
possibility that Russian factories using American capital and American 
technology will, with Soviet slave labor, produce goods which will undersell 
those produced by American labor in world markets.  Just as many thousands of 
Americans have already lost their jobs to foreign labor working in European and 
Asian factories constructed with American foreign aid. </p>
<p align="left">     This point has not been lost on AFL-CIO chieftain George 
Meany, who succinctly summed up his feelings about the continuing giveaway of 
grain, technology, defense, secrets, and jobs: </p>
<blockquote>
<p align="left">"We don't want any part of it.  We're not interested in 
	seeing cheap goods made by Soviet slave labor pour into this country.  We 
	are not interested in seeing American workers displaced by slave labor." </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left">     Testifying at a Congressional hearing on <i>detente</i>, 
Meany also assailed the Export-Import Bank for its giveaway credit rates: </p>
<blockquote>
<p align="left">"What American can get a loan at six percent?  This isn't 
	trade.  This is a welfare program for Russia." </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left">     But as important as jobs are, there is even a more 
important aspect to our aid to the Communists.  At stake is the very survival of 
our freedom and independence. </p>
<p align="left">     Professor Sutton has assembled an abundance of evidence 
which nobody has even attempted to refute.  First, he has shown that Communism 
is a stagnant system incapable of innovation or high productivity.  Its 
survival, even a a subsistence level for its captives, has required regular 
transfusions of capital and technology.  Without aid from the West, the Soviet 
Union would have long since collapsed. </p>
<p align="left">     The Soviet Union was first saved by Herbert Hoover with 
food.  Next came Lenin's New Economic Plan, which let the super-capitalists back 
into Russia.  This was followed by FDR's diplomatic recognition of Russia, which 
allowed the Soviets to obtain desperately needed credits.  <font color="blue"><u>World 
War II turned on the $11billion Lend-Lease </u></font>spigot. </p>
<p align="left">     Following the war, Russia was allowed to denude much of 
Germany of factories and scientists.  During the Kennedy Administration we 
started providing wheat for hungry Soviet factory workers  During the Vietnam 
War, America shipped vital supplies to the East European bloc, which was 
providing North Vietnam with the war equipment to kill our own soldiers.  Now we 
are supplying the world's largest truck factory, extremely sophisticated 
computers, and a cornucopia of other manufacturing technology. </p>
<p align="left">     To cap this incredible recitation, the <i>Wall Street 
Journal </i>of April 15, 1975, headlined: "U.S. Quietly Allows Uranium Shipments 
to Soviet Union for Processing Into Fuel." Is that unbelievable? </p>
<p align="left">     Perhaps the most eloquent opponent of detente is the exiled 
Soviet author Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn.  He has asked: </p>
<blockquote>
<p align="left">"What does the spirit of Helsinki and the spirit of <i>
	detente</i> mean for us within the Soviet Union?  The strengthening of 
	totalitarianism.  What seems to you to be a milder atmosphere is for us the 
	strengthening of totalitarianism." </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left">     And he adds: </p>
<blockquote>
<p align="left">"You think that this a a respite, but it is an imaginary 
	respite.  It's a respite before destruction.  As for us, we have no respite 
	at all.  We're being strangled even more, with greater determination. . . "
	</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left">     Solzhenitsyn visited the United States in 1975. He was here 
at the very time of the Soviet-American joint space flight and the "handshake in 
space".  His every word, both spoken and written, his very presence branded as a 
lie the Kissinger-Rockefeller-CFR policies.  A man who could testify from 
first-hand experience in the <i>Gulag Archipelago</i> that Communism was not 
mellowing was a distinct embarrassment to the Washington Establishment. </p>
<p align="left">     Secretary Kissinger advised President Ford that 
Solzhenitsyn's views endangered the stable relations between the United States 
and the Soviet Union.  Henry the K -- who had smilingly shaken hands with the 
most vicious tyrants and bloodiest murderers in history -- refused to meet the 
Nobel Laureate.  Henry the Knife advised the President not to meet with him, 
either, so the White House snubbed this distinguished champion of freedom. </p>
<p align="left">     The Kissinger-Ford team ignored a man who supports 
traditional American principles, for the sake of some "allies" who have sworn 
they will bury us. </p>
<p align="left">     And once again we must ask, whose side is Henry on, anyway?
</p>

<p align="left">     There may, of course, be an even more sinister reason for 
the Red China gambit.  It is the reason which underlies so much of the frenetic 
surface activity of the Shadow Government:<b> <u>control of the world's energy 
resources</u>.</b> </p>
<p align="left">As Congressman John Rarick reported in July 1971: </p>
<blockquote>
<p align="left">"Also early in April, reports were leaked concerning rich

<p align="left">     Later in the year, newspapers reported that a "fantastic 
exploration race" was underway in the Far East. </p>
<p align="center"><a name="THE_RED_CHINA_GAMBIT__"><big><big>THE RED CHINA 
GAMBIT</big></big> </a></p>
<p align="left">     Sixteen years ago Henry A. Kissinger was as worried about 
the rulers of Red China as any other American boy. He wrote at the time: </p>
<blockquote>
<p align="left">"The prospect that China by 1978 might have the nuclear 
	capability of the Soviet Union in 1960 is terrifying.  Many of the notions 
	of nuclear deterrence may not apply with respect to a country which has 
	shown so callous a disregard of human life." </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left">     A callous disregard for human life?  If any group has ever 
merited such a label, it is the Communist leaders of mainland china, who 
butchered between 30 and 60 million of their own people to consolidate their 
power!  But twelve years late, how things have changed. </p>
<blockquote>
<p align="left">"We accept now. . . in the light. . . of improvement in 
	relations with the People's Republic of China, that we could pay this price 
	of foregoing the additional protection that the President requested in his 
	original statement", </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left">Henry cooed in 1972.  And he added, </p>
<blockquote>
<p align="left">"The idea of a third nuclear country attacking the United 
	States is a rather remote possibility". </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left">     The rulers of Red China had not changed one iota in the 
past twelve years.  But Henry had swiveled 180 degrees.  What did it mean? </p>
<p align="left">     On July 1, 1971, Special Assistant for National Security 
Affairs, Henry Kissinger and party, left Andrews Air Force Base near Washington 
aboard a huge, almost windowless, KC-135, the military version of the Boeing 
707.  Henry was joined by Harold Saunders, one of his deputies; John Holdridge, 
a member of his staff specializing in Far Eastern affairs; Winston Lord, a 
special assistant; Richard Smyser, a foreign service officer and expert on 
Southeast Asia; and two Secret Service agents.   </p>
<p align="left">     (A few months earlier, Smyser had made headlines of another 
sort, when he was the host of a rather unusual affair in Washington.  Ties were 
optional at Smyser's soiree, but trousers were not.  Men were not allowed to 
wear any pants at his party.  One guest went so far as to arrive at the "trouserless 
orgy", as one commentator called it, dressed in drawers made from an American 
flag.  Smyser made him feel right at home.) </p>
<p align="left">     Their ostensible destination, at least as far as Washington 
press releases were concerned, was South Vietnam and several other Far Eastern 
countries.  But the ten-day "fact-finding" trip had a far more sinister 
purpose.  </p>
<p align="left">     The Kissinger party "vanished" during the stopover in 
Pakistan.  It was said that Kissinger had become "slightly indisposed" and had 
gone to a remote hill station 60 miles north of Rawalpindi "to recuperate". </p>
<p align="left">     Instead, on July 9, the Kissinger party secretly flew 
another 2,300 miles, from Pakistan to Peking, and began a precedent-setting 
49-hour visit with the leaders of Communist China -- the first official-level 
contacts with the mainland since it had been seized by the Communists 22 years 
before. </p>
<p align="left">     It was the first in a series of nine trips by Henry 
Kissinger to Red China.  It was certainly his most spectacular diplomatic coup 
thus far.  It unquestionably signaled a major change in the course of American 
foreign policy. </p>
<p align="left">     The Peking gambit set the stage for the visit by President 
Richard Nixon.  It anticipated other Kissinger trips, and also laid the 
groundwork for a visit by President Gerald Ford.  It began the alleged "thaw" in 
American-Red Chinese relations, which was paralleled by the abandonment of the 
Republic of China and the ouster of that World War II ally, a founder of the 
United Nations, from that world boy. </p>
<p align="left">     Kissinger's secret, surprise visit established the 
foundation for trade relations between the U.S. and Peking and, perhaps most 
important of all, it provided an immeasurable amount of <i>face </i>throughout 
the Orient for the Red Chinese leaders. </p>
<p align="left">     Everything about the opening to Red China was done in 
secret.  We have yet to be informed how the opening came about, what deals were 
made during the lengthy chats between Henry Kissinger and the Red Chinese 
leaders (and later between the two American Presidents and their Red Chinese 
hosts), or what the ultimate price of this "opening" will be.  The "opening" 
began in secret, with clandestine conferences, and the secrecy continues even 
now. </p>
<p align="left">     Kissinger clearly sees his role in the Red China opening as 
one of the hallmarks of his White House career, an act so momentous that he 
would ignore the American debacle in Vietnam, which ended in total disaster for 
the United States, as an unimportant footnote in comparison to the rapprochement 
with Red China. </p>
<p align="left">     In twelve years, Kissinger's public utterances had 
flip-flopped from concern about callous leaders with nuclear weapons to 
saccharin eulogies of mass murderers Mao Tse-tung and Chou En-lai. </p>
<p align="left">     The willingness, even eagerness, of American leaders to hop 
into bed with a regime whose history of human brutality, mass executions, mass 
murder, and imposition of terror has no par in modern human history, was one of 
the most shameful events of a shame-filled decade. </p>
<p align="left">     Curiously enough, it has recently been reported that 
Richard Nixon's first major directive to his first major appointment concerned 
precisely such a development.  We are now told that within his first twelve days 
in office, Nixon told Kissinger to draw up plans for a way to achieve a 
Peking-Washington rapprochement.  But where did the idea <i>really</i> 
originate? </p>
<p align="left">     Depending on who is doing the counting, the most 
conservative estimates are that Communist Chinese leaders carried out the 
deliberate murders of from 34 million to 64 million helpless victims during the 
takeover of the mainland, the subsequent purges, and the "great cultural 
revolution" of the 1960s. Alongside such astronomical totals, even the figures 
of Nazi atrocities pale in comparison. (Figures are from "The Human Cost of 
Communism", a report of the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee.) </p>
<p align="left">     As far back as November 1959, Nelson Rockefeller, then 
governor of New York, was telling students in a University of Oregon speech that 
the United States should establish "intimate" relations with Red China. </p>
<p align="left">     Of course, the pro-Red China lobby had been actively 
campaigning for years for just such an "opening".  Its academicians, in large 
part based at Harvard, were especially eager to embrace Mao. In fact, a group of 
such professors from Harvard and MIT prepared a memorandum in the fall of 1968 
outlining the steps to be taken to achieve "peace" with Communist China.  The 
memorandum was addressed to "President-Elect Nixon", and it was delivered by -- 
have you guessed it? -- Henry A. Kissinger!  The memorandum cast a long shadow 
of coming events: </p>
<blockquote>
<p align="left">. . . Suggesting you [Nixon] should seriously explore the 
	possibility of arranging confidential, perhaps even deniable, conversations 
	between Chinese Communist leaders and someone in whom you have confidence. 
	 It may be that the Chinese will refuse to receive such an emissary.  The 
	effort should nonetheless be made to signal a revised American attitude. 
	 Bring China, both Vietnams and other divided nations into the United 
	Nations.  Seed an early opportunity to modify America's trade embargo 
	against China. </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left">     And, certainly it is significant that shortly before the 
Kissinger-Nixon Administration began courting Red China like a love-starved 
Casanova, David Rockefeller held a press conference in Hong Kong and called for 
opening up trade with Communist China.  Later, Mao and company would appoint the 
Rockefellers' Chase Manhattan Bank as Red China's official representative for 
Chinese-American trade. </p>
<p align="left">     In brief, all the signs point not to a Nixon initiative to 
China, but to a Nixon <i>response </i>to an initiative already planned and 
prepared by the Shadow Government, and implemented by the Insiders' number one 
agent in the White House, Henry A. Kissinger. </p>
<p align="left">     Asians in particular have made much of the fact that in all 
of the hullabaloo over an opening to Peking, not a single signal was flashed 
from China seeking such a new relationship.  Not a single major Red Chinese 
dignitary came kowtowing to Washington, to genuflect at the feet of American 
power brokers.  It was all the other way around.  In the game of "face", the 
Chinese Communists won every round. </p>
<p align="left">     The fact is that a carefully orchestrated propaganda drive 
to build up Peking and downgrade Taiwan was already well underway.  The 
publicity blitz would be underscored by lavish receptions for Presidents Nixon 
and Ford in the Great Hall of the People, elaborately staged tableaux of 
presidential families visiting cheerful communes, and banquet tables piled high 
with Chinese cuisine. </p>
<p align="left">     By now, rehabilitation of the "Old China Hands" -- men like 
John Stewart Service, John Paton Davies, John Carter Vincent, Oliver Edmund 
Clubb, and other pro-Communist policy molders of the World War II era who had 
done so much for Mao Tse-tung, Ho Chi-minh, and Chou En-lai -- was almost 
complete.  The Peking butchers were henceforth to be regarded as moderate, 
responsible leaders of a nation which no longer could be considered as an 
aggressor. </p>
<p align="left">     Recent history regarding Korea and Vietnam and other 
unpleasant facts, such as the brutal invasion and annexation of Tibet, were 
conveniently dumped into the Orwellian memory hole.  Washington went all-out to 
create an image of a changing China taking its place in the world community. 
 The director, producer, and choreographer for the whole phony skit was of 
course Henry Kissinger. </p>
<p align="left">     Not everyone was buying the new scenario.  A notable 
exception was FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, whose sudden death in the midst of 
the contrived euphoria over the embrace of Red China was convenient to say the 
least. </p>
<p align="left">     Kissinger's friendly biographer, Charles Ashman, relates 
the following: </p>
<blockquote>
<p align="left">"For a long time Kissinger kept out of the dispute over 
	whether Hoover should be forcibly retired. . . </p>
<p align="left">Then J. Edgar goofed -- and badly -- when Nixon was about to 
	announce his projected trip to Red China.  It was a venture dear to the 
	heart of Kissinger, the theoretician and advance man.  He had waited more 
	than three years to reactivate the plan he had privately given Governor 
	Nelson Rockefeller for reopening the door to China. . . </p>
<p align="left">Hoover was not among the handful of top officials consulted 
	when plans for the President's visit to China were brewing. . . </p>
<p align="left">It was hardly surprising. . .  that during a routine 
	appearance before a Congressional committee, Hoover routinely warned the 
	lawmakers, "the United States is Communist China's No. 1 enemy.  The most 
	potent threat to our national security is Red China." ZAP!  Kissinger was 
	furious." </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left">     Kissinger quietly arranged for the FBI Director's comments 
not to be published, for, he said, "budgetary" reasons.  Sure.  But the FBI 
Director released them to the Veterans of Foreign Wars.  The result was a 
scathing article which warned that Red Chinese spies, under the guise of trade 
and cultural missions, would flood the nation.  Hoover died in the spring of 
1972, but, as Ashman puts it, "his days were probably numbered" by then anyway.
</p>
<p align="left">     In the same year, the White House suppressed a documentary 
film made by the U.S. Information Agency (which can hardly be described as a 
right-wing anti-Communist group).  The movie, "Man from a Missing Land", 
portrayed the Red Chinese takeover of Tibet, culminating in the flight of the 
Dalai Lama, Tibet's spiritual leader.  The Dalai Lama said that the Red Chinese 
had broken every promise they had ever made regarding Tibetan autonomy. </p>
<p align="left">     But by this time, Kissinger was proclaiming that his new 
friends had always been "true to their word", so history had to be doctored to 
support him.  The taxpayers never saw the film -- although they had paid nearly 
$100,000 for it. </p>
<p align="left">     By 1975, Henry's determination to permit nothing to 
embarrass the Red Chinese had become an absolute phobia.  Even Liberal columnist 
Jack Anderson reported: </p>
<blockquote>
<p align="left">Secretary of State Henry Kissinger is so sensitive over the 
	special relationship he has nurtured with the Chinese Communists that he 
	personally makes all decisions on Chinese matters, no matter how trivial 
	they may be. </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left">     One of the trivial matters in which Kissinger took a direct 
hand was his effort to play down the Republic of China's participation in the 
American Bicentennial.  The Kissinger order, reported Anderson, was "to keep the 
Nationalists {Taiwan} as invisible as possible". </p>
<p align="left">     In 1971 Kissinger had declared: </p>
<blockquote>
<p align="left">"Our position is that the ultimate disposition, the ultimate 
	relationship of Taiwan to the People's Republic of China, should be settled 
	by direct negotiations between Taiwan and the People's Republic of China".
	</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left">     Please notice that the Republic of China -- a free and 
independent nation -- had become Taiwan, the name of the island, and, 
historically, just one province of the mainland.  The demotion was a diplomatic 
rebuff clearly signaled to the rest of the world. </p>
<p align="left">     Almost at once, there were leaks from Washington to the 
effect that the Red Chinese would not agree to the first Nixon trip until they 
received advance guarantees that the United States would reduce its military 
presence in the Republic of China.  Although such a "deal" was denied at the 
time -- after all, who in Washington could admit that the United States had 
grovelled to meet Red China's terms? -- even President Ford now admits that 
American military assistance to Free China is being drastically reduced. </p>
<p align="left">     The shape of things to come was indicated in the so-called 
"Shanghai Communique", issued during the Nixon trip of 1972.  The communique 
stated that the United States recognizes that Taiwan is a part of China and 
"affirms the ultimate objective of the withdrawal of all U.S. forces and 
military installations from Taiwan". </p>
<p align="left">     And remember that the island republic that was being so 
completely betrayed was not only of of our staunchest anti-Communist allies; our 
leaders were also helping subvert a nation which had achieved an economic 
miracle since World War II.  As Representative Philip M. Crane told his 
colleagues in the House of Representatives on December 11, 1975: </p>
<p align="left">"A recent survey of family life in Taipei, the capital city, 
suggests a standard of living unknown on the Communist Chinese mainland and in 
most parts of Asia.  More than half the families live in their own homes, most 
of the rest live in apartments and only a handful live in government provided 
housing. . . </p>
<p align="left">What makes these accomplishments most remarkable is the fact 
that the Republic of China has the highest population density in the world." </p>
<p align="left">     While it is true that much of this was accomplished, or at 
least started, with the assistance of U.S. foreign aid, it is also true that 
Free China is one of the few nations on earth that has <i>repaid</i> the loans 
and grants  it received from this country.  This is reported about as often as 
the fact that the Soviet Union still owes us over $11 billion from World War II.
</p>
<p align="left">     When the lengthening shadow of Watergate finally forced his 
resignation, President Nixon made much of the fact that during his truncated 
tenure he had "unlocked the doors" between the United States and China. </p>
<p align="left">     But Mme. Chiang Kai-shek, widow of the fabled leader whom 
the Americans had abandoned, put things in a better perspective. "The unlocking 
of the doors of the mainland would indeed be a very good thing were it true", 
she said.  "Unlocking the doors means free egress and ingress.  The pity of it 
all is that no compatriots of ours are permitted to leave the country and their 
enforced serfdom." </p>
<p align="left">     In 1975, after a visit to Peking by President Gerald Ford, 
Kissinger could strongly hint that the next steps in re-establishing diplomatic 
relations with Peking would be for the United States to sever diplomatic ties 
with nationalist China and substantially reduce troop levels on Taiwan. </p>
<p align="left">     Henry Bradsher put it just that directly in the Washington 
Star: </p>
<blockquote>
<p align="left">A blunt fact that was long obscured in circumlocutions and 
	pious intentions has finally emerged into the open as a result of President 
	Ford's trip to China:  The United States will simply have to break its 
	written and moral commitments to the Chinese Nationalist regime and cast 
	Taiwan adrift if it intends to have full-scale, normalized relations with 
	the People's Republic of China. </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left">     Two years earlier, Kissinger was confident enough of his 
position -- and the plans of his superiors --to assure his Red Chinese friends 
that U.S. friendship with the mainland would continue "whatever the 
Administration" in Washington.  After all, administrations come and go, but the 
Rockefellers endure. </p>
<p align="left">     In 1973 Kissinger met for almost three hours with the 
ailing Mao Tse-tung.  As usual, whatever was discussed in the session, and 
whatever agreements were made, remained cloaked in secrecy.  But Peking 
officials said the talks "looked far into the future" and were of "great 
significance". </p>
<p align="left">     Kissinger's 1975 preparatory trip was followed by what must 
have been the most anti-climactic visit in the entire series of American 
arrivals in the fabled Heavenly Kingdom.  So little was accomplished when Gerald 
Ford and entourage arrived in Peking, in fact, that there was not even a joint 
communique issued at the end of the mission.  The visit seemed even more 
unnecessary than the ones undertaken before. </p>
<p align="left">     Oh sure, there were the usual sumptuous state banquets, 
there was lots of clapping in unison by Red chinese moppets, theatrical and 
gymnastic performances, visits to Chinese shrines, and Betty Ford even performed 
with a dance troupe.  But there was so little real news that White House press 
Secretary Ron Nessen scampered around, cautioning reporters not to assume that 
because nothing was happening, nothing was being accomplished. </p>
<p align="left">     Part of the problem, of course, may have been that the Red 
chinese hierarchy had only a passing interest in the interim American President 
-- a man whom they may already have decided was only a figurehead anyway. </p>
<p align="left">     Associated Press reported that Mao gave his biggest welcome 
to Kissinger, not Ford.  The Chinese leader noticeably and vigorously pumped the 
beaming Kissinger's hand for at least half a minute when the Americans arrived. 
 Later, when he said goodbye, Mao again shook Kissinger's hand longer than 
Ford's.  Such apparently minor matters may be ignored by most Americans, but you 
can be sure that foreign leaders -- especially in the Orient -- know exactly 
what such demonstrations mean. And so does Herr Kissinger! </p>
<p align="left">     so what, really, does it all mean?  It is obvious that 
Kissinger has forgotten his 1961 assessment that "China is lost to the cause of 
freedom" and that "everywhere Communism presses aggressively on its 
peripheries". (Or at least he would like others to forget those remarks.) </p>
<p align="left">     What has happened?  Did the men he described in 1961 as 
"callous fanatics" change?  Or did he? </p>
<p align="left">     Certainly, the American people have a right to know just 
what is being gained by the Red China gambit.  We have been told it is essential 
to world peace, that it represents a thawing in dangerous relations.  We have 
been told it is good for business -- ignoring the fact that the small island of 
Taiwan out-exports the primitive and backward mainland economy by a ration of a 
thousand to one. </p>
<p align="left">     Finally, we are told that we simply can't afford not to 
strive for better relations with leaders who rule somewhere between 700 and 800 
million human beings.  While the same pundits and policy makers who tell us we 
must open the doors to Red China also insist we quarantine Rhodesia as a threat 
to world peace.  What hypocrisy! </p>
<p align="left">     While Red china has been conducting a "smiling-face 
diplomacy" that is quite comfortable with Henry Kissinger's own vision of a 
Grand Design which will see the slow merger of the United States into a world 
government, the Peking masters have also been actively preparing to reach for 
our throats. </p>
<p align="left">     In <i>The Necessity for Choice</i>, published in 1961, Herr 
Henry wondered worriedly "whether we can stand idly by while this peril (Chinese 
nuclear capacity) develops, simply trusting that a more humane group of leaders 
will replace the incumbents".  Of course, no "more humane group" arose.  but by 
1972, Kissinger was trusting the incumbents <i>not</i> to mount a nuclear attack 
which the United States, thanks to his own policies, would be all but powerless 
to prevent. </p>
<p align="left">     While Henry Kissinger publicly pooh-poohs any military 
threat from Red China, the Communists there have been mounting a nuclear arsenal 
and also developing what is already the third largest navy in the world. 
 According to the Institute for Strategic Studies in London, the Red Chinese 
already deploy more than a thousand vessels, including 60 submarines and 600 
aircraft, and more are being built all the time. </p>
<p align="left">     By 1975 Red china had exploded 16 nuclear bombs ranging in 
strength from twenty kilotons to three megatons.  At a secluded test range in 
occupied Tibet, the Chinese have been preparing for the launching of their first 
intercontinental ballistic missile.  Events have strongly indicated that while 
the Peking hierarchy was "vigorously pumping" the hand of Henry Kissinger, and 
providing our Presidents with heaping plates of chow mein, the country has been 
engaged in a crash program to increase the quality and quantity of their 
offensive weapons. </p>
<p align="left">     Authors Phyllis Schlafly and Chester Ward (in <i>Kissinger 
on the Couch</i>) accuse the Secretary of State of knowingly misleading Congress 
regarding Red Chinese nuclear capabilities. </p>
<p align="left">     During a SALT 1 briefing, for example, Kissinger said, "our 
estimate of the Chinese nuclear capability is still approximately what it was at 
the time that Safeguard was developed -- implying that in the years 1969 to 
1972, the Red chinese were at a stand-still in nuclear weapons development.  But 
back in February 1970, Defense Secretary Melvin Laird acknowledged that the 
Chinese were already able to test an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM). 
And he added that he expected them to have an ICBM operational capacity "in the 
next several years". </p>
<p align="left">     By February 17, 1972, Laird was reporting: </p>
<blockquote>
<p align="left">The growth of Chinese nuclear strike capability has been 
	remarkable given the short time it has been in existence and the formidable 
	obstacles that had to be overcome. . . </p>
<p align="left">There is some evidence that the Chinese are engaged in the
	<i>deployment</i> of solid fuel missiles. . . </p>
<p align="left">The two Chinese space satellites launched during the last 
	year and a half, the approximately one dozen nuclear tests since 1964, 
	indicate a fairly high degree of sophistication in both missile and warhead 
	development. </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left">     One year later, the Defense secretary remarked about the 
even more "remarkable growth of China's nuclear strike capability in both 
missiles and bombers". Laird said that "The (Communist). . . Chinese are moving 
forward rapidly with their program to <i>deploy </i>liquid-fueled missiles and 
to develop an ICBM". </p>
<p align="left">     If this is what Kissinger means by a standstill, we would 
hate to see how dangerous the Chinese Reds could become if they really tried!
</p>
<p align="left">     Nuclear bombs and intercontinental missiles are a <i>
potential </i>threat against us.  There is an even more insidious weapon already 
in use.  Lurking behind the smiling diplomacy of the Red Chinese is one of the 
most vicious weapons ever devised for global conquest -- the deliberate pushing 
of opium, heroin, and other narcotics in the Free World. </p>
<p align="left">     As early as 1960, Harry J. Anslinger, Chief of the U.S. 
Bureau of Narcotics, warned that more than five million acres of land in Red 
China were devoted exclusively to the intensive cultivation of the opium poppy. 
 In fact, Anslinger reported, the production of opium was an organized 
government monopoly in Red China. </p>
<p align="left">     Red Chinese opium production has been variously estimated 
at 10,000 to 32,000 tons per year.  Opium and its derivatives are thus the <i>
single most important item</i> for the Red Chinese, who net an estimated $5 <i>
billion</i> a year from the diabolical business.  The use of narcotics as a 
weapon of warfare by the Red Chinese was thoroughly documented in Vietnam, where 
heroin was offered to American servicemen at a fraction of its value.  Now, the 
conquest of most of Southeast Asia by the Communists adds a whole new dimension 
to an already catastrophic situation. </p>
<p align="left">     For generations, much illicit opium has come from the 
"Golden Triangle" of Burma, Laos, and Thailand, where whole provinces have been 
involved in poppy cultivation.  The Communist coup in Laos, and the possible 
absorption of Thailand, will provide massive new quantities of opium and 
derivatives to be pushed in the West. </p>
<p align="left">     the thirteen and fourteen-year-old girls in New York city 
who turn to prostitution to finance their addiction, the muggers and purse 
snatchers and burglars in Chicago and Dallas and a thousand other cities with 
expensive habits, the promising students who have turned off forever, these too 
are part of the price we in the West are paying for Henry Kissinger's 
"smiling-face diplomacy" with the Red Chinese. </p>
<p align="left">     <b>There may, of course, be an even more sinister reason 
for the Red China gambit.  It is the reason which underlies so much of the 
frenetic surface activity of the Shadow Government: <u>control of the world's 
energy resources</u>.</b> </p>
<p align="left">     In April 1971, an elite group of international financiers, 
economists, and intellectuals called the Bilderbergers met in secret session at 
Woodstock, Vermont.  Among the items discussed by the participants (who included 
Henry Kissinger, David Rockefeller, and various oil company officials) was "the 
possibility of a change in the American role in the world and its consequences".
</p>
<p align="left">     As Congressman John Rarick reported in July 1971: </p>
<blockquote>
<p align="left">"Also early in April, reports were leaked concerning rich 
	oil discoveries in the Asian Pacific area, including areas claimed by Red 
	China.  Mentioned among the oil exploration companies were those represented 
	at the hush-hush Bilderberger meeting.  Then in June, we were advised that 
	chase Manhattan Bank was ready to invest $6 million in oil exploration and 
	predicted $250 billion in Free World investment in the Asian Pacific area up 
	to 1980." </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left">     Later in the year, newspapers reported that a "fantastic 
exploration race" was underway in the Far East. </p>
<blockquote>
<p align="left">     "Within the year, that dramatic change in American 
	foreign policy had occurred.  Within two years, the Los Angeles Times could 
	report (on February 21, 1973): "Intensive surveys have indicated that oil 
	fields that could almost equal all the rest of the world's known reserves 
	almost certainly lie off China's shores. . . </p>
<p align="left">The Chinese have been making inquiries of U.S. firms about

<p align="left">     Since only the United States possesses the technology to 
drill for oil in the 400 to 600-foot depths involved, the discoveries made <i>
detente </i>virtually inevitable.  The pattern is clear:  The international oil 
cartel, dominated by Rockefeller interests, has, perhaps, the <i>most </i>to 
gain from Washington-Peking <i>detente</i>.  All other concerns -- ideological, 
strategic, geopolitical -- are subservient to that reality.  And Henry Kissinger

<p align="center">---------------------------------------------- </p>
<p align="left">     . . . an even more mysterious occurrence:  The worldwide 
alert of U.S. strategic and conventional forces on the night of October 24, 
1973.  Nixon and Kissinger said at the time that the United States was in the 
midst of its "most difficult" crisis since the Cuban missile episode of 1962. 
 But neither man, despite promises to the contrary, has ever revealed what the 
crisis was!  The U.S. and the U.S.S.R. were, presumably, nose-to-nose and eyball-to-eyeball 
-- a whisker away from Armageddon.  And no one knew why. </p>
<p align="left">     Of the various explanations that have been advanced, one 
that we may now firmly rule out of consideration is one that seemed to make the 
most sense -- and is the most charitable to Secretary Kissinger.  It is that 
those sneaky, deceitful Russians were up to some diabolical stunt, the details 
of which can't be released, and Herr Henry stopped them cold in their tracks.
</p>
<p align="left">     We now know this isn't what happened, because the United 
States and the Soviet Union were both represented by the same man in the Middle 
East -- Henry A. Kissinger! </p>
<p align="left">    </p>
<p align="center"><a name="THE_UNQUIET_PEACE_IN_THE_MIDDLE_EAST__"><big><big>THE 
UNQUIET PEACE IN THE MIDDLE EAST</big></big> </a></p>
<p align="left">    If there is one ever-recurring image that made Henry 
Kissinger, it is that of an inspired flight-bag diplomat shuttling hurriedly 
between the capitals of the Middle East in the quest of an elusive peace. </p>
<p align="left">     No one can deposit the intermittent Arab-Israeli war at 
Kissinger's doorstep.  It goes back too far for that.  suffice it to say that 
American foreign policy in the Middle East was destined to get the United States 
into hot water from the beginning.  By supporting the artificial creation of the 
state of Israel in the midst of the Arab world, this nation {the U.S.} alienated 
hundreds of millions of potential allies.  From the Arab point of view, 
America's massive support of Israel since 1948 has been a hostile action for 
three decades. </p>
<p align="left">     This assessment has nothing to do with the noteworthy 
achievements of the Jewish state.  It is obvious that Arab opposition to Israel, 
and Israel's determination to survive, constitute the unstoppable force 
colliding with the inexorable object.  Nobody in his right mind believes the 
"peace' -- actually an "interim peace agreement" -- engineered by Henry 
Kissinger can endure for very long. </p>
<p align="left">     The 1975 Israeli-Arab accords negotiated by Kissinger did 
avoid an immediate confrontation between the super-powers.  But what they may 
very well have done is prepare the way for a much greater war -- one in which 
the United States will have, as usual, equipped <i>both</i> sides with 
sophisticated weapons. </p>
<p align="left">     The cost to the United States for the secret agreements 
secretly arrived at has been estimated at $10 to $25 billion, which is hardly 
cheery news to the U.S. taxpayers who will have to foot the bill.  Nor did the 
interim agreement delight the Israelis, who were literally arm-twisted into 
accepting it.   </p>
<p align="left">     Indeed, an Israeli journalist named Matti Golan claims that 
Israeli leaders feel they were repeatedly deceived by the U.S. Secretary of 
State.  In <i>The Secret Conversations of Henry Kissinger</i>, Golan portrays 
Kissinger as an inveterate gossip who delights in malicious stories about the 
leaders with whom he negotiates.  "He seems to have a need to prove to the world 
-- and to himself -- how great he is", Golan writes. "And that's another reason 
why he talks so much." </p>
<p align="left">     Golan charges that Kissinger: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p align="left">Blamed the Pentagon for holding up the airlift of arms to 
	Israel, when he himself was responsible for the delay; </p></li>
<li>
<p align="left">Told Israel he would not negotiate a cease-fire with the 
	Soviet Union, and then proceeded to do so; </p></li>
<li>
<p align="left">Encouraged Israel to score a decisive, last-minute military 
	victory over the Arabs, then garnered more headlines by a grandstand demand 
	for a halt in hostilities. </p></li>
</ul>
<p align="left">     According to Golan, Israeli Premier Golda Meir was "shocked 
and furious" at Kissinger after the Secretary promised to delay talks in Moscow 
concerning the Middle East ceasefire (so Israel could recover from its serious 
set-backs in the war), then suddenly signed a cease-fire agreement with the 
Soviets. </p>
<p align="left">     The 1973 war, which was as striking a defeat for Israel as 
the Six-Day War in 1967 had been an amazing victory, may also have provided a 
smoke screen for something of more moment than the actual hostilities: namely, 
the rise in oil prices by the international petroleum cartel. </p>
<p align="left">     The prestigious International Institute for Strategic 
Studies in London has described the use of the "oil weapon" by the Arabs in the 
fall of 1973 as "the greatest shock, the most potent sense of a new era, of any 
event in recent years."  The Arab boycott of the Western world, and the huge 
increase in oil prices which resulted, caused such economic and political 
repercussions that 1974 became known as "the year Europe lost its head" --a 
reference to the number of European rulers who were replaced in the ensuing 
panic. </p>
<p align="left">     Several commentators suggest that it was <i>detente</i>, 
arranged by Henry Kissinger, which gave the Arabs confidence to use the "oil 
weapon."  Prior to <i>detente</i>, no one questioned the credibility of the U.S. 
nuclear umbrella or our determination to protect the nations of the Free World.
</p>
<p align="left">     In the post-Vietnam world of <i>detente</i>, however, our 
reputation was on the skids.  The militarily weak Arabs obviously placed their 
faith in the ability of the Soviets to block any Western retaliation for the oil 
boycott. </p>
<p align="left">     The new economic realities pummeled the dollar and European 
currencies furiously.  The only beneficiaries of the oil crisis turned out to be 
the Arabs, the Soviet Union, and -- lest we forget -- the Western oil cartel. 
(It is the Western oil cartel, dominated by Rockefeller interests, which 
refines, distributes, and retails Arab oil.)  As a result of the crisis, the 
Soviets were able to reap huge windfall profits from the value of their own gold 
reserves and from favorable exchange rates in deals with the West. </p>
<p align="left">     But the whole crisis also brought a bonanza to the oil 
barons in the West.  So much so that some suspicious critics believe the 
Rockefeller-Kissinger team "put in the fix" at the beginning.  The game plan, as 
these cynics see it, goes like this:  the Arabs were encouraged to go to war to 
recover the territories they lost in 1967;  in the meantime, the U.S. provided 
massive support to Israel, which in turn induced the Arabs to cut off supplies 
of oil to the West. This permitted U.S. oil companies to increase domestic 
prices a few cents a gallon <i>every week</i>; meanwhile, oil-producing nations 
doubled and tripled crude oil prices. The American oil firms with interest in 
both camps -- that is, those companies that are part of the Rockefeller-CFR team 
-- made a bundle. </p>
<p align="left">     Whether that exact sequence of events occurred because it 
was planned that way is still speculation.  But the Arab oil embargo did provide 
a windfall for the Western petroleum cartel, shooting the Rockefeller-controlled 
Exxon into number one in <i>Fortune's </i>list of the nations' largest 
industrials.  And there can be no doubt that the alarmist cries of a great 
petroleum scarcity were completely contrived. </p>
<p align="left">     At the time of the "crisis" of 1973-74, the Interior 
Department estimated the amount of "easily recoverable" oil at 80 billion 
barrels, and shale oil accessible through intensive technology at 600 billion 
barrels -- or enough to last 100 years at present consumption rates.  This is in 
addition to the estimated 780 billion barrels available in offshore oil 
reserves.  Nor does it include at least 20 billion barrels of oil easily 
accessible in Alaska.  The sum total of these reserves, including the easily 
recoverable shale oil, is 880 billion barrels -- enough to last well in the 21st 
century! </p>
<p align="left">     In the meantime, the squeeze is on the consuming public and 
the small independent oil companies, not the giant multinational conglomerates. 
 Back in 1969, the independents had urged President Nixon to lift oil import 
quotas, which would have allowed the importation of lower-priced foreign oil 
while easing the drain on domestic reserves. </p>
<p align="left">     But Nixon kept the import restrictions in place until just 
before the convenient 1973 Middle East war, thus guaranteeing a much higher 
price for foreign crude oil.  The price tag for consumers in this country? 
 Between $4 and $7 <i>billion</i> a year in higher prices. </p>
<p align="left">     Even by mid-December 1973, there was no genuine shortage at 
the gasoline pumps.  Then along came William E Simon of the CFR.  The nation's 
new federal energy czar, who had been an investment banker with Salomon Brothers 
(an international banking house linked to the Rockefellers), established an 
intriguing program whereby gasoline was allocated away from areas of high demand 
into areas where the demand was less. </p>
<p align="left">     Very quickly a panic began to develop.  Who could tell 
people who had just spent hours waiting at the pump for their gasoline rations 
that there was no real shortage of petroleum? </p>
<p align="left">     Despite the overwhelming evidence that we were <i>not </i>
"running out of oil", the petroleum panic of 1973 set the stage for Kissinger's 
next move -- promotion of a "global energy strategy".  Another contrived panic 
was leading inevitably to its contrived solution -- more power and controls for 
the Insiders who were running the show. </p>
<p align="left">     For a more complete account of how shortages are 
deliberately created, especially in food and fuel, to drive up prices and 
prepare the way for more national (and later, international) controls, see 
Chapters Ten and Eleven of <i>The Rockefeller File</i>. </p>
<p align="left">     About this time, the public relations boys were called in 
to sell the public on the merits of Project Independence. But in a  moment of 
candor, Secretary Kissinger admitted that talk of national "energy independence" 
is a fraud.  Project Independence, he said, is simply "a way station on the way 
to Project Interdependence". </p>
<p align="left">     Another way station on the road to interdependence -- or, 
as Kissinger prefers to call it, a New World Order -- may be the flow of Western 
dollars to oil producers in the Middle East.  The present flood of $100 billion 
a year is greater than the total of all U.S. investments abroad.  If the rate 
continues much longer, the Middle East oil producers may accumulate so much 
capital they will be able to "buy out" the West.  Already their deposits in 21 
of the largest U.S. banks have reached the astronomical total of $14.5 <i>
billion</i>. </p>
<p align="left">     In March 1975, <i>Harper's </i>published a curious article 
called "Seizing Arab Oil", written by someone (the pseudonym Miles Ignotus was 
used), "close to the Pentagon and to the highest level of U.S. policy-makers". 
 The magazine presented a complete scenario of how the United States might use 
military action in the Arab countries to secure "vital" supplies of oil. </p>
<p align="left">     About the same time, you will recall, Kissinger had already 
spoken openly about possible U.S. military intervention in the Middle East, to 
protect our "vital" supplies of oil.  His remarks, although totally out of place 
for a diplomat, did underscore our alleged dependence on Arab oil -- even though 
the Middle East supplies less than ten percent of all petroleum consumed in the 
United States. </p>
<p align="left">     In the meantime, the effect of Kissinger's action has been 
to protect the Arabs' position and profits! The <i>Los Angeles Times</i> 
commented in March 1975 that it was "indeed strange" to see the Ford 
Administration arranging "what would amount to a price support program for Arab 
oil -- a safety net that would protect the cartel from market forces that might 
otherwise destroy it". </p>
<p align="left">     As the <i>Times</i> observed, when the Organization of 
Petroleum Exporting Countries quadrupled the price of oil, it acted "like a 300% 
sales tax", draining away billions of dollars that otherwise would have been 
spent in the United States, therefore deepening the recession in the U.S. and 
Western Europe.  "A major drop in oil prices", the <i>Times</i> analysis 
continued, would "contribute enormously to a return to prosperity by putting 
billions of dollars back into consumer pockets.  It is amazing that. . . an 
Administration policy that would shut off the possibility of this happening has 
aroused so few questions". </p>
<p align="left">     It <i>is</i> amazing -- unless, of course, the real 
objective was <i>not </i>to rescue the West from a contrived shortage, but to 
strengthen the oil cartel, weaken national governments, grease the tracks for 
yet another slide toward interdependence -- meaning global government, meaning 
global monopoly. </p>
<p align="left">     Are the Arab sheiks being set up to trigger a war in the 
Middle East, a bloody conflict whose final outcome would be a major step toward 
world government and the "internationalization" of oil? And could the United 
States be drawn into such a conflict?  Quite possible.  The "interim peace 
agreement" constructed by Kissinger supports both possibilities. </p>
<p align="left">     Aside from the geographical concessions involved in the 
agreement (Israel withdrew to a new line in the Sinai, withdrew from the Giddi 
and Mitla passes, surrendered the Abu Rodeis oil fields on the Gulf of suez, and 
gave up another corridor north of the fields), American guarantees to Israel 
include at least $2 billion for military hardware during the current year, plus 
another $350 million per year for five years as a "fuel replacement guarantee".
</p>
<p align="left">     All of this will be underwritten by U.S. taxpayers, of 
course.  Egypt already the recipient of gobs of American largess, did not fare 
quite as well, receiving promises of only $750 million in aid.  To sweeten the 
deal, the United States also threw in a $2 million helicopter for Egyptian 
President Anwar Sadat (which no one in Egypt was trained to fly), and the 
promise of some $16.5 million worth of wheat under a long-term low-interest 
loan. </p>
<p align="left">     When the terms of the deal were first announced, it was 
understood that the package also contained some secret commitment negotiated by 
Kissinger.  Over the Secretary's strong objections, the Senate Foreign Relations 
Committee voted to release all of the agreement.  The terms turned out to be 
even worse than the parts already leaked to the press. </p>
<p align="left">     Among such routine matters as a U.S. pledge not to 
recognize the Palestine Liberation Organization and American assurances to 
continue providing Egypt with economic aid were two shockers.   </p>
<p align="left">     First, the United States promised to consider supplying 
Israel with Pershing ground-to-ground missiles. The 460-mile-range Pershing 
missiles would put key Arab population centers within Israeli reach.  And 
although the agreement calls for us to provide only conventional warheads, if 
reports are correct that Israel already has at least a dozen atomic bombs, there 
is no reason <i>not</i> to think Israel could equip the projectiles with nuclear 
warheads.  Such a development could lead to an arms race in the Middle East that 
would make the early challenges seem as mild by comparison as a Saturday 
afternoon game of marbles. </p>
<p align="left">     The second part of our secret pledge to Israel was the 
promise that we would provide the country with petroleum should it be boycotted 
by other oil producers!   </p>
<p align="left">     The total cost of the deal boggles the imagination. 
 Senator Jesse Helms called the pact a "blank check agreement" and warned that 
the final cost would not be known.  Senator Harry F. Byrd stormed that the price 
tag, during the five years of its implementation, might be as high as $15 
billion.  Other observers set the true cost at $25 billion.  Not a few 
Congressmen were aghast that, at a time when our citizens were being told that a 
full supply of oil could not be guaranteed in our own country, American 
taxpayers were being asked to guarantee oil supplies for Israel. </p>
<p align="left">     There have been almost as many explanations offered for the 
incredibly generous American promises as there have been critics of the interim 
agreement itself. </p>
<p align="left">     Ernest Cuneo of the North American Newspaper Alliance, who 
described the Israeli-Egyptian accord as "a Munich with Hitlerian terms dictated 
by Henry Kissinger", has suggested that Super K may have been trapped into 
making such mind-boggling pledges when he was betrayed by his Russian friends. 
Cuneo reports the following scenario: </p>
<blockquote>
<p align="left">When the Russian general staff saw that the Israelis had 
	surrounded the Egyptian Third Army, it loudly threatened military 
	intervention and moved the Red Air Force into battle alert.  Succumbing to 
	the bluff, Kissinger ordered a cease-fire, which saved the Egyptian armies 
	and forced the Israelis to yield the east bank of the Suez Canal. </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left">     Even the brothers Kalb, hardly hostile biographers of our 
super Secretary, don't seem to know what to make of Henry's negotiating prowess 
on this one.  In their adulatory study <i>Kissinger</i>, Marvin and Bernard 
suggest that Kissinger was caught off-guard when the Soviet-subsidized Arabs 
attacked Israel.  Henry had been convinced, the Kalbs state, that detente was 
working and that Soviet intransigence was melting. "Just as he had misjudged 
prewar intelligence", they wrote", so too had he misjudged the will and 
capability of the Arabs and the duplicity of the Russians". </p>
<p align="left">     Possibly.  But neither theory explains an even more 
mysterious occurrence:  The worldwide alert of U.S. strategic and conventional 
forces on the night of October 24, 1973.  Nixon and Kissinger said at the time 
that the United States was in the midst of its "most difficult" crisis since the 
Cuban missile episode of 1962.  But neither man, despite promises to the 
contrary, has ever revealed what the crisis was!  The U.S. and the U.S.S.R. 
were, presumably, nose-to-nose and eyball-to-eyeball -- a whisker away from 
Armageddon.  And no one knew why. </p>
<p align="left">     In <i>Kissinger on the Couch</i>, the authors suggest that 
the strategic alert might have been a Kissinger ploy to sell the nation a dual 
message.  First, that Kissinger somehow had stared down the Russians in a crisis 
and, second, that our strategic forces were still sufficiently frightening to 
fend off a Soviet attack. Such doomsday imagery was used at the SALT talks in 
Moscow and helped obscure the fact that the negotiations covertly but decisively 
favored the Soviet Union. </p>
<p align="left">     Of the various explanations that have been advanced, one 
that we may now firmly rule out of consideration is one that seemed to make the 
most sense -- and is the most charitable to Secretary Kissinger.  It is that 
those sneaky, deceitful Russians were up to some diabolical stunt, the details 
of which can't be released, and Herr Henry stopped them cold in their tracks.
</p>
<p align="left">     We now know this isn't what happened, because the United 
States and the Soviet Union were both represented by the same man in the Middle 
East -- Henry A. Kissinger! </p>
<p align="left">     Yes, so confident was Moscow of Kissinger's flight bag 
diplomacy in the crisis that he was used as a negotiator for both sides!  That 
was the surprise disclosure by Soviet ambassador Anatoly Dobrynin, Kissinger's 
friend, who told other diplomats in Washington that Kissinger was serving as 
negotiator for the Soviets as sell as the United States in the Middle East. </p>
<p align="left">     But if the worldwide "precautionary alert" by American 
forces was not meant to call the Soviets' bluff, for whom was it arranged? 
 Perhaps to hide the fact that the Soviets and our Secretary of State were 
working hand-in-glove all along! </p>
<p align="left">     Impossible?  But why not?  The net result of the latest <i>
pax Kissingerae</i> will cost Americans anywhere from $10 to $25 billion.  It 
will cost the Soviets not one red cent.  Or should we say, not one Red ruble. 
 We have agreed to provide Israel with the latest advanced weaponry.  At the 
same time we will give massive economic aid to Egypt and other Arab countries, 
guarantee the sheiks' oil profits, and thus enable the Arab bloc to go shopping 
for weapons to counter the new Israeli gadgets. </p>
<p align="left">     The result, then, of Kissinger's shuttle diplomacy in the 
Middle East was a "peace" package which guarantees peace for neither Israel nor 
her neighbors. </p>
<p align="left">     It shackles United States taxpayers with an incredible new 
burden.  And its only clear beneficiaries are the Soviet Union, the oil cartel, 
and the promoters of a New World Order. </p>
<p align="left">     Once again the question arises:  Who is Kissinger really 
serving? </p>
<p align="left">     Anyone who still contends that he is a sincere servant of 
the American people must also admit that he is then a miserable failure.  His 
every act, every new accord he arranges, seems to help our enemies and hurt 
ourselves and our friends. </p>
<p align="left">     Reviewing the whole incredible picture, we can't quell the 
still small voice that keeps insisting, "It was all planned this way in the 
first place".  Was it? </p>

<p align="left">     In fact, Henry the K had even asked the Rand Corporation to 
study the circumstances under which the anti-Communist government of Brazil 
might be overthrown!  This second study was not triggered by a great Kissinger 
concern over Brazil shifting to the Left.  It seems that some Brazilian 
government officials had discussed the possibility of expropriating the holdings 
of International Petroleum Company, a subsidiary of the Rockefellers' Standard 
Oil of New Jersey. </p>
<p align="center">--------------------------------------------------- </p>
<p align="left">     So in August 1975, the Organization of American States, 
meeting in Costa Rica, voted 16 to 3 with two abstentions to lift its sanctions 
against the Communist dictatorship ninety miles from our shores.  The U.S. 
Ambassador to the OAS, Rockefeller man William S. Maillard, did not make even a 
token resistance to this carefully staged repudiation of Washington's policy for 
the past eleven years. </p>
<p align="left">     Incredibly, the vote whitewashing Cuba did not set any 
conditions or make any demands of the Red dictatorship.  The United States 
delegates did not even mention the 2,000 Americans still confined on the island, 
the $2 <i>billion </i>indebtedness to Americans for property confiscated by 
Cuban authorities, the thousands of political prisoners languishing in Cuban 
dungeons, the 33,000 Cubans slain by the Communists to establish a Soviet power 
base on the island.  All this was to be forgiven, forgotten, and ignored.   </p>
<p align="center"><a name="BETRAYING_FREEDOM_IN_LATIN_AMERICA  __">
<big><big>BETRAYING FREEDOM IN LATIN AMERICA </big> </big> </a></p>
<p align="left">      The Nixon campaign rhetoric in 1968 promised a hard line 
against Communist excursions in the Western Hemisphere. Bus as in so many cases 
in the Nixon Era, while the conservatives got the rhetoric, the Liberals got all 
of the action.  When Rockefeller agent Henry Kissinger was installed as adviser 
on national affairs, it became apparent that "holding firm" meant giving the 
Communists almost everything they wanted, just as quickly as public opinion 
would allow. </p>
<p align="left">   The Rockefeller-Kissinger team immediately began promoting a 
Latin American foreign policy which was the very antithesis of the policy 
Americans thought they were getting when they elected Richard Nixon.  It 
consisted of two main reversals of earlier promises.  The first was a growing 
recognition of the Communist conquest of Cuba.  Accepting this fact was to be 
sold to the American people as hemispherically inevitable, necessary for peace, 
and besides, it made good business sense. </p>
<p align="left">     The second key part of the kissinger policy was even more 
ticklish, and it ran into stiff opposition from the start.  That was Henry the 
K's repeated efforts to surrender U.S. sovereignty over the Panama Canal. The 
giveaway of this strategic waterway was being sold to the public as vital to 
improve our poor relations with much of Latin America. </p>
<p align="left">     But most Americans were too mesmerized by the three-ring 
foreign-policy circus overseas -- the "opening" to Red China, the "peace" in 
Vietnam, the incessant war in the Middle East -- to pay too much attention to 
what was going on in nearby Latin America. </p>
<p align="left">     soon after Nixon took office in 1969, conservative 
columnist Paul Scott reported that although "the President pledged to tighten 
the U.S. economic-political quarantine of Cuba if elected, Kissinger is working 
quietly within the Nixon Administration for just the opposite".  It became known 
that Kissinger had asked the Rand Corporation to make a study on the feasibility 
of restoring political, economic, and cultural relations with Cuba.   </p>
<p align="left">     In fact, Henry the K had even asked the Rand Corporation to 
study the circumstances under which the anti-Communist government of Brazil 
might be overthrown! </p>
<p align="left">     This second study was not triggered by a great Kissinger 
concern over Brazil shifting to the Left.  It seems that some Brazilian 
government officials had discussed the possibility of expropriating the holdings 
of International Petroleum Company, a subsidiary of the Rockefellers' Standard 
Oil of New Jersey. </p>
<p align="left">     While all this was going on, any efforts within the Nixon 
Administration to move against Communism in this hemisphere -- and there <i>were
</i>anti-Communists around Nixon as well as within the State and the CIA -- were 
blocked by Kissinger.  </p>
<p align="left">     The stage was set for U.S. trade with the Cuban tyranny and 
eventual U.S. recognition through one of Henry's usual tactics -- secret U.S. 
maneuvering.  The plan called for the Organization of American States to soften 
its stand against Cuba.  Then the United States would reluctantly bow to "the 
will of the Americas" and grant recognition to the Castro regime.  The whole 
affair was about as spontaneous as the Rose Parade. </p>
<p align="left">     The North American Newspaper Alliance reported in October 
1974 that an agreement "in principle" for U.S. recognition of Cuba had already 
been reached and that "the current script calls for the United States to appear 
as if it were forced to acquiesce to the views of the other American States".
</p>
<p align="left">     NANA's Ernest Cuneo added:  "In clinging to the ridiculous 
fiction that his State Department officials know nothing of the negotiations, 
Kissinger is moralizing to the American people -- again. </p>
<p align="left">     By May 1975 <i>The Review of the News</i> could report that
</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="left">"through the covert efforts of Secretary of State Henry 
	Kissinger governments of Latin American countries are being told that the 
	U.S. looks with favor on the lifting of sanctions against Communist Cuba by 
	the Organization of American States".  </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left">     By June, Fidel Castro was so confident that the United 
States would restore diplomatic relations with Cuba that he predicted in 
Madrid's <i>Arriba </i>magazine, that recognition would occur, that Latin 
American countries would grow stronger while the United States grew weaker, and 
that Cuba was not planning to budge one inch on its declared aim of seizing our 
Guantanamo Naval base. </p>
<p align="left">     "Some day they will leave Guantanamo just as they left 
Vietnam in the war that cost them $150 billion", the bearded one gloated. </p>
<p align="left">     Another part of Kissinger's propaganda effort on behalf of 
Castro was granting permission for "friendly" U.S. congressmen to junket to 
Cuba.  The most enraptured visitor was former presidential candidate George 
McGovern, the muddled Leftist who made Richard Nixon look so good by comparison 
in 1972.  McGovern's trip to Cuba resulted in a saccharin outpouring of eulogies 
for Castro and demands for an end to our economic embargo. </p>
<p align="left">     Kissinger, who arranged McGovern's private flight to Cuba 
from a U.S. airbase in Florida, got exactly what he wanted. </p>
<p align="left">     So in August 1975, the Organization of American States, 
meeting in Costa Rica, voted 16 to 3 with two abstentions to lift its sanctions 
against the Communist dictatorship ninety miles from our shores. </p>
<p align="left">     The U.S. Ambassador to the OAS, Rockefeller man William S. 
Maillard, did not make even a token resistance to this carefully staged 
repudiation of Washington's policy for the past eleven years. </p>
<p align="left">     Incredibly, the vote whitewashing Cuba did not set any 
conditions or make any demands of the Red dictatorship.  The United States 
delegates did not even mention the 2,000 Americans still confined on the island, 
the $2 <i>billion </i>indebtedness to Americans for property confiscated by 
Cuban authorities, the thousands of political prisoners languishing in Cuban 
dungeons, the 33,000 Cubans slain by the Communists to establish a Soviet power 
base on the island.  All this was to be forgiven, forgotten, and ignored. </p>
<p align="left">     While Kissinger is cuddling up to Cuba, the island has 
become virtually a Russian military outpost.  There are at least 25,000 Russian 
soldiers operating military bases at Mariel, Nipe, Cienfuegos, Cayo Largo, Playa 
Giron, and the Isle of Pines.  Some 8,000 russian technicians run most of Cuba's 
vital industries.  There are frequent Soviet spy flights and reconnaissance 
sailings from points within Cuba. </p>
<p align="left">     For the past seventeen years, Communist cuba has also been 
exporting its revolution in every way that it can.  Airplane hijackings, for 
example, increased some four-hundred percent in the late 1960s -- just after 
a school for hijackers was organized on the island.  The evidence is 
indisputable that Havana has become a key base for the smuggling of opium and 
other hard narcotics from Communist supply sources in the Far East into the 
United States and Latin America. </p>
<p align="left">     Fidel Castro has openly gloated, of course, that he expects 
to take over the U.S. Naval Base on Guantanamo -- the multi-billion-dollar 
American outpost which is a vital link for American defense forces in the 
Western Hemisphere.  Should Henry Kissinger present this giftwrapped to the 
Communists (and in Washington there are rumors such a secret deal has already 
been made), the Communists would threaten <i>all </i>shipping through the Panama 
Canal. </p>
<p align="left">     While Fidel's effort to supply the leadership to Communist 
revolts in other Latin and South American countries may have faltered in recent 
years, the presence of Cuban troops in Africa more than makes up for any 
failures closer to home.  Any conceivable detente with Cuba became even harder 
to swallow in late 1975 and 1976 as it became clear that the Soviet Union was 
using cuba as its major base for the armed takeover of Angola, the former 
Portuguese territory on Africa's west coast.  The 15,000 Cuban troops inside 
Angola may well have made the difference for the Soviet victory in the war 
there. </p>
<p align="left">     According to Paul Scott, thousands of Cuban troops, 
military advisers, and espionage agents, financed and directed by the russians, 
are deployed in at least fifteen countries on three continents.  In the 
meantime, Cuba's 150,000-man army remains the largest in the Western Hemisphere, 
other than our own. </p>
<p align="left">     As the Angola involvement developed day by day in late 1973 
and early 1976, Kissinger <i>sounded</i> good. He talked tough about the Cubans 
sending soldiers to Africa, about the Soviet Union being in Africa, about the 
"extra-continental intervention" into Angolan affairs.   </p>
<p align="left">     But as expected, the Administration <i>did</i> nothing to 
thwart the Communists.  In fact, since much of the $81 million in the U.S. 
grants, loans, and credits for neighboring Zaire, run by the Marxist "President 
for Life" Sese Seko Kuku Ngbendu Wa Za Banga, were funneled into Angola, it 
meant the United States was in the unique position of helping Red China fund one 
of the "anti-Soviet" factions in the weird Angola war. </p>
<p align="left">     So while Kissinger publicly warned Castro about cuban 
intervention in Angola, at the same time Henry K told the U.S. representative to 
the Organization of American States to vote for dismantling the OAS special 
commission which had kept tabs on Communist activities in the Western 
Hemisphere.  Kissinger was about as sincere as W.C. Fields offering to lead a 
temperance crusade against demon rum. </p>
<p align="left">     Why is Henry Kissinger so determined to have the United 
States embrace Communist cuba? </p>
<p align="left">     Part of the reason, no doubt, is the whole 
do-anything-to-please-the-Communists mentality which plays such an important 
part in <i>detente</i>.  And there is ample evidence that the Soviets would like 
to see the American taxpayers underwrite the cost of the glorious socialist 
experiment on the island.   </p>
<p align="left">     Although Cuba had been one of the wealthiest nations in the 
Americas before the advent of Communism, presently it is a $1.5 million <i>per 
day</i> liability for Moscow.  Much better that the burden be shifted to U.S. 
taxpayers. </p>
<p align="left">     In fact, the Union Defensora de la Democracia, an 
anti-Communist group in Mexico, reported in mid-1975 that the stage has already 
been set for the Rockefellers' Chase Manhattan Bank to loan Cuba all the money 
it needs to cut its $8-million -per-week umbilical cord with Moscow.  The loans, 
of course, will never be repaid; the money will be loaned by the Rockefellers, 
but <i>guaranteed by the U.S. government</i>. </p>
<p align="left">     When Castro defaults, the U.S. government will pay off the 
Rockefellers. </p>
<p align="left">     It would hardly be the first time that American taxpayers 
have rescued Rockefeller operations in other countries.  A huge number of U.S. 
loans for "less developed countries" have a strange way of ending up in the 
pockets of the Rockefellers.  Foreign aid programs, for example, apparently 
insure Rockefeller gaming lodges in Kenya, Rockefeller agricultural and 
marketing businesses in Iran, a Rockefeller ceramic tile and bath accessory 
plant in Korea, Rockefeller firms in the Dominican Republic, and House of 
Rockefeller enterprises in India, Guyana, Brazil, Pakistan, the Philippines, and 
dozens, perhaps scores, of other countries.  </p>
<p align="left">     The <i>London Sunday Telegraph</i> on August 31, 1957 
however, provided an even more intriguing explanation for the 
Rockefeller-Kissinger embrace of Castro: </p>
<blockquote>
<p align="left">This year's most surprising <i>detente</i> -- the resumption 
	of relations of a sort between President Ford's U.S.A. and Fidel Castro's 
	Communist Cuba -- owes a good deal more to hard heads than to soft hearts. 
	The motive behind it can be summed up in one word -- oil. . . </p>
<p align="left">Recent seismological tests by the Russians in Cuban waters 
	have apparently revealed the likelihood of several large oil structures 
	which form the immensely rich Gulf of Mexico oil fields.  But Castro knows 
	only too well that to develop such fields he will need American finance. </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left">     Kissinger's kiss-and-make-up approach to Communist Cuba (at 
U.S. taxpayer expense, of course) is bad enough for America.  But actually his 
policies regarding Cuba seem like hard-nosed anti-Communism when compared to his 
incredible actions aimed at surrendering U.S. sovereignty over the Panama Canal.
</p>
<p align="left">     If American sentiment and official congressional action 
count for anything, the chances that the federal government will give away the 
Panama Canal are zero.  On June 24, 1975, the House of Representatives voted 246 
to 164 to prohibit any State Department funds from being used to negotiate the 
surrender of any U.S. rights in the Panama Canal Zone.   </p>
<p align="left">     Public surveys taken about the same time showed that five 
Americans out of six wanted the U.S. to retain ownership of the Canal.  And a 
group of 38 Senators -- four more than needed to block ratification of any 
giveaway treaty -- was on record opposing any surrender of U.S. rights in the 
Canal Zone. </p>
<p align="left">     but popular sentiment and even Congressional action were 
not enough to thwart a Kissinger who had already chosen a different direction. 
 Following the House vote, he sent the following message to General Omar 
Torrijos, the pro-Soviet dictator of Panama: </p>
<blockquote>
<p align="left">I want you to know that in spite of these things, I am still 
	engaged in the search for a final and just solution to this problem and the 
	establishment of a new and more modern relationship between the two 
	countries. </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left">     In other words, Henry the K was apologizing to Comrade 
Torrijos because the representatives of the American people refused to go along 
with Kissinger's surrender scheme! </p>
<p align="left">     Despite the propaganda line being developed to "legitimize" 
the surrender of our sovereignty over the Panama Canal, the facts are as 
follows: </p>
<blockquote>
<p align="left">The Panama Canal belongs to the United States.   </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p align="left">The Canal Zone was sold to this country on November 18, 
	1903, by the new Republic of Panama.   </p>
<p align="left">The agreement gave the United States total and complete 
	ownership "in perpetuity".   </p>
<p align="left">The treaty was ironclad -- it stated that U.s. sovereignty 
	would be "to the entire exclusion of the exercise by the Republic of Panama 
	of any such sovereign rights, power or authority." </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left">     Despite what some American negotiators, such as Ellsworth 
Bunker and William d. Rogers, have suggested, it seems absurd to think that the 
U.S. could be stampeded into signing away the Panama Canal because of 
sword-rattling by a tiny Latin American country. "If Panama does not recover the 
Canal Zone, no one can prevent the Panamanians from destroying, making 
inoperative, or paralyzing the canal", said one foreign policy adviser. </p>
<p align="left">     Panama "has reached the limit of its patience" in 
negotiations with the U.S. for a new treaty, warned Dictator Torrijos in early 
1975.  The United States has 11,000 troops stationed along the Canal -- twice 
the number of soldiers that Torrijos commands.  But bunker and Rogers act as if 
they were truly worried about what this tinhorn dictator might do. </p>
<p align="left">     Ellsworth bunker, moreover, seems to have made a career out 
of surrendering gracefully to the Communists.  He was the main negotiator of the 
team that turned over control of West New Guinea to Communist Achmed Sukarno in 
1965, in exchange for a worthless promise of free elections. </p>
<p align="left">     Bunker later was appointed U.S. Ambassador to South 
Vietnam, where he continually lectured American military officials on the need 
to exercise "the Patience and restraint to fight a limited war with limited 
means for limited objectives".  Ellsworth bunker is, in short, a giveaway artist 
and a capitulation expert.  He is just the kind of fellow Kissinger would select 
for negotiations on giving away the Panama Canal. </p>
<p align="left">     Incredibly enough, Bunker has claimed that giving the 
Panama Canal to the Communists will somehow be good for us.  "In our 
negotiations we are attempting to lay the foundations for anew -- a more modern 
-- relationship which will enlist Panamanian cooperation and <i>better protect 
our interest</i>", he has said.   </p>
<p align="left">     That groaning sound you hear is Teddy Roosevelt turning 
over in his grave.  Teddy Roosevelt, who maneuvered to get the canal built, 
later said, </p>
<p align="left">"The canal must not be internationalized.  It is our canal; we 
built it; we fortified it, and we will not permit our enemies to use it in war. 
 In times of peace, all nations shall use it alike, but in time of war our 
interest becomes dominant." </p>
<p align="left">     The United States does not "rent" the Canal Zone.  this 
country paid for and has clear title to it.  giving away the clear title we have 
to the Panama Canal is exactly the same as giving Alaska back to Russia, 
returning the Louisiana Purchase to France, or surrendering Texas and California 
to Mexico and Spain. </p>
<p align="left">     It will not surprise you to learn that an early architect 
of the Panama giveaway scheme was a Rockefeller man, robert B. Anderson of the 
CFR.  He was President Johnson's chief negotiator in 1967, subsequently kept on 
by Richard Nixon.  (The <i>first</i> U.S. official to propose that the Canal be 
internationalized was the very respected CFR man in the State Department, Alger 
Hiss!) </p>
<p align="left">     But it was that other, much better known Rockefeller agent, 
Henry Kissinger, who took up the cudgels from Anderson.  Herr Henry signed a 
"statement of principles" with Dictator Torrijos in February 1974, promising 
that the U.S. would renounce sovereignty over the Canal and hand it over to 
Panama.  When Nixon resigned and Ford assumed what used to be the highest office 
in the land, Kissinger was quick to inform Panama that "the change in the U.S. 
presidency will not affect the negotiations for a new Panama Canal treaty". </p>
<p align="left">     Perhaps alarmed by the growing opposition within the United 
States to Kissinger's surrender schemes in the Caribbean, a new rockefeller 
pressure group, "The Commission on U.S.-Latin American Relations" was launched 
in mid-1974 (a few months after Secretary Kissinger signed the 'statement of 
principles' with Panama's Marxist Dictator), to marshal public support for our 
planned retreat.  The commission is financed by grants from -- would you 
believe?-- the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, the Ford Foundation, the Clark 
Foundation, and David Rockefeller's Center for Inter-American Affairs. </p>
<p align="left">     The Commission promptly unveiled its own program for peace 
in Central America.  The major plan, of course was a call for a new treaty with 
Panama in which the United States would cancel all claims to ownership of the 
Canal. </p>
<p align="left">     When this rockefeller-Kissinger giveaway scheme encountered 
heavy opposition in 1975, not only from the public but also from Congress, the 
Rockefeller Commission came up with a new wrinkle to the basic surrender plan 
the Shadow Government had been following.  The new scheme, which was designed to 
sidestep opposition from the Congress, called for the United States to continue 
to use the land and facilities in Panama, and pay for them, but to transfer 
jurisdiction to Panama. </p>
<p align="left">     Since the deal would not involve any sale or transfer of 
U.S. property, Congress would be left out of the negotiations -- and the U.S. 
would retain an empty title.  This Rockefeller-designed gambit is probably 
behind Kissinger's convoluted explanation of our new policy regarding Panama:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="left">The U.S. is seeking to establish a new and mutually 
	acceptable relationship between our two countries whereby the U.S. can 
	continue operating and defending the canal for a reasonably extended period 
	of time.  A new treaty would enable the U.S. to devote its energies to the 
	efficient operation and control of the waterway and would leave other 
	matters to the Panamanians. </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left">     Translate that to read:  We'll arrange it so that Uncle Sap 
-- I mean, Sam -- will continue to pay all the bills.  But we'll make sure that 
when the chips are down, it will be our Comrades in Panama -- and Moscow -- who 
will determine which ships pass through and which ones don't. </p>
<p align="left">     what would the loss of American jurisdiction over the 
Panama Canal mean?  first would be the devastating diplomatic consequences of 
yet another collapse of American power and authority.  but there is a far more 
serious aspect of Henry K's two-pronged campaign to legitimize Communism in Cuba 
and to surrender our sovereignty over the Panama Canal. </p>
<p align="left">     As we reported earlier, the Soviet Navy now surpasses the 
U.s. Navy.  It virtually controls the Mediterranean and Indian Oceans, and 
through the Soviet conquests in Africa, is becoming dominant in the Atlantic. 
 should part of the price for Kissinger's detente mean the loss of both the 
Panama Canal and the U.s. base on Guantanamo, the stage would be set for the 
Communists to sever the connecting link between the U.s. Pacific fleet and our 
Atlantic forces.  In effect, Kissinger's planned retreat in the Caribbean would 
extend the Soviet spheres of naval dominance from the Black Sea across the 
Atlantic to our very shores.  It would leave all of Latin and south America 
unprotected and indefensible. </p>
<p align="left">     As Representative Daniel Flood has stated: </p>
<blockquote>
<p align="left">"I do not see how the Kremlin itself could have prepared a 
	more effective plan for causing confusion and chaos on the Isthmus than has 
	been done by our treaty negotiators -- a plan that is designed to assure the 
	ultimate extinction of all United States authority with respect to any canal 
	on the Isthmus." </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left">     Or to put it another way, Moscow's most important man in 
Latin America is not Fidel Castro; it's Henry Kissinger. </p>

 But the record now is clear -- Super Kraut had been a key policy adviser on 
Vietnam since the Johnson years and always championed no-win policies.   </p>
<p align="left">     Joseph Harsch (CFR) noted in 1968 that Kissinger "was one

<p align="left">     Throughout the Vietnam War, the U.S. did little that was

<p align="left">     <b>Secretary of State Kissinger opposed all three measures.</b>
</p>
<p align="center">---------------------------------------------------------- </p>
<p align="left">     In private talks in 1968, Henry said that the "appropriate 
goal" of U.S. policy in Vietnam should be to permit a "decent interval" -- say, 
two or three years -- between the withdrawal of U.S. forces and a complete 
Communist takeover of the country! </p>
<p align="center"><a name="THE_SELLOUT_OF_SOUTHEAST_ASIA__"><big><big>THE 
SELLOUT OF SOUTHEAST ASIA</big></big> </a></p>
<p align="left">     Perhaps the grimmest irony of the Kissinger years was the 
awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize to the Secretary of State in 1974, honoring 
his efforts to end the Vietnam War.  The ceremonies in Stockholm were hardly 
over when the Communists seized three Southeast Asian countries.  Herr Henry did 
not even have time to spend the $50,000 prize before South Vietnam, Laos, and 
Cambodia had been swallowed by the Communist juggernaut.  Some peace! </p>
<p align="left">     North Vietnam's Le Duc Tho, with whom Kissinger shared the 
Peace Prize, declined the award -- no doubt aware that the Paris accords were 
but a way station on the road to a total Red victory. </p>
<p align="left">     The January 1973 "peace agreement" which Super K negotiated 
had in fact set up South Vietnam for the kill, by allowing the Communists to 
keep more than 150,000 Red troops "in place" in the South, while American 
military personnel were withdrawn.  Anyone who was surprised at what happened 
would be equally disappointed when the tooth fairy fails to make an appearance. 
 South Vietnam was overrun, Cambodia collapsed, and Laos became fully communist. 
  </p>
<p align="left">     It was a three-bagger.  the United States lost three former 
allies in as many months. </p>
<p align="left">     for the first time it became obvious to the world that 
American strength meant nothing in the face of a Communist advance.   </p>
<p align="left">     The highly touted <i>Mayaguez </i>incident may have helped 
reverse the Administration's faltering image at home, but it did nothing to 
change the facts overseas.  When Cambodian Communists seized the merchantman <i>
Mayaguez </i>and its crew of 39 in May 1975, American warplanes blasted five 
Cambodian vessels out of the water, the Marines stormed Tang Island, and U.S. 
fighter-bombers blitzed an airbase and an oil depot on the mainland to secure 
the sailors' release.   </p>
<p align="left">     The theatrical assault cost five American dead, 16 missing, 
and 70 to 80 wounded, but it was proof-positive that U.s. might can be used 
successfully when Washington wants to.  It gave the sagging Ford Administration 
and defeat-weary Americans a lift in spirits, but it did not change the facts -- 
or the fate of South Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos. </p>
<p align="left">     At least, these were the facts in 1971.  In the fall of 
that year, a group of U.S. observers toured all 44 provinces of south Vietnam 
and noted that the Saigon government -- hardly an ideal administration -- had 
essential working control over the full country.  The Vietcong insurgency had 
been smashed.  But U.S. bombing pauses and strategic lulls were giving the North 
time to build up and regroup its forces in the south.      </p>
<p align="left">     Then, in the spring of 1972, North Vietnam openly invaded 
the south.  It was only after the invasion of tens of thousands of North 
Vietnamese troops that the Paris "peace" accords were arranged.  The new reality 
confirmed by Henry Kissinger accepted the presence of more than 150,000 Red 
soldiers in South Vietnam -- with 50,000 more ready to join them. </p>
<p align="left">     Kissinger's apologists have claimed that their hero 
inherited a war whose successful outcome eluded three prior administrations. 
 But the record now is clear -- Super Kraut had been a key policy adviser on 
Vietnam since the Johnson years and always championed no-win policies.   </p>
<p align="left">     Joseph Harsch (CFR) noted in 1968 that Kissinger "was one 
of the first among the top experts to conclude that a military victory in 
Vietnam was, perhaps, neither possible nor desired." </p>
<p align="left">     It is also known that Kissinger established his own links 
with North Vietnam as early as 1967.  His secret negotiations -- arranged by 
avowed Communists from Australia and France -- assured Moscow and Hanoi from the 
start that Herr Henry would not countenance any American moves that might lead 
to an anti-Communist victory. </p>
<p align="left">     Throughout the Vietnam War, the U.S. did little that was 
right -- right in the sense of trying to win the war.  But during the Nixon 
years there were three actions taken which veteran military observers supported 
as moves in the proper direction:   </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p align="left">the invasion of Cambodia in 1970 to eliminate Communist 
	sanctuaries; </p></li>
<li>
<p align="left">the May 1972 decision to mine Haiphong Harbor; and </p></li>
<li>
<p align="left">the December 1972 decision to bomb North Vietnam.   </p></li>
</ul>
<p align="left">     Secretary of State Kissinger opposed all three measures.
</p>
<p align="left">     The Americans found in Cambodia they were mostly chasing 
ghosts.  Obviously forewarned, few Communist troops were encountered -- though 
some supplies and foodstuffs were found.   </p>
<p align="left">     Reliable sources within the intelligence community report 
that Henry the K told his good friend Soviet Ambassador Anatoly Dobrynin about 
plans for the invasion while the two attended a Soviet cocktail party to 
commemorate Lenin's 100th birthday. </p>
<p align="left">     Regarding the mining of Haiphong Harbor -- which was also 
an ineffectual but highly publicized gambit -- Jack Anderson reported in October 
1974 that this was the single action Nixon ever took on his own, one in which he 
overrode all his close advisers, including his Vietnam expert, Henry Kissinger.
</p>
<p align="left">     But it was the third incident; Nixon's decision on December 
17, 1972 to bomb North Vietnam, which let to a real split between the two. 
 Kissinger so angered the President, we have been told, that Nixon ordered 
Henry's phone tapped and finally decided that Kissinger should be replaced. </p>
<p align="left">     The story was first broken by one-time Nixon hatchet man 
Charles Colson in his book <i>Born Again</i>.  Other sources confirmed the 
details: </p>
<p align="left">     Kissinger pleaded with Nixon to "explain his reasons for 
the bombing".  When the President refused, and ordered the Executive Branch to 
maintain a strict silence about the bombing renewal, Kissinger let it be known 
that he opposed the bombing.   </p>
<p align="left">     When <i>New York Times </i>columnist James Reston reported 
Kissinger's dissent, Nixon was furious.  The President said: </p>
<blockquote>
<p align="left">"I will not tolerate insubordination. You tell Henry he's to 
	talk to no one, period!  I mean no one!  And tell him not to call me.  I 
	will accept no calls from him." </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left">     Nixon sought solace in watching a Washington Redskins 
football game, while Henry jetted off to Palm Springs, California.  Next, says 
Colson, </p>
<blockquote>
<p align="left">"The President ordered me to have the Secret Service keep a 
	record of all incoming and outgoing calls from Kissinger's heavily guarded 
	villa in Palm Springs." </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left">     Kissinger tried to telephone Nixon, but the President 
refused to talk with him.  Kissinger then contacted another media friend, <i>
Washington Post</i> columnist Joseph Kraft, who reported that Kissinger had 
valiantly opposed Nixon's bombing order.  This infuriated Nixon so much that he 
"began counting the days until Henry left to return to Harvard", Colson 
continues. </p>
<p align="left">     Earlier this year, columnist Jack Anderson reported that 
Super K was well aware that an irate Nixon was moving to dump him as Secretary 
of State.   </p>
<blockquote>
<p align="left">"Sources close to Kissinger say he was acutely aware of the 
	move to send him back to Harvard.  The H.R. Haldeman-John Ehrlichman-Charles 
	Colson palace guard wanted to force him out in disgrace and make him the 
	scapegoat for Nixon's bombing policies." </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left">     But as everyone knows, it was not kissinger who left 
Washington in disgrace, but the President himself. We will take a look at 
Henry's behind-the-scenes role in Watergate, which led to this amazing 
turnabout, in Chapter Ten. </p>
<p align="left">     Even with the massive Communist buildup in 1971 and 1972, 
who can doubt the the United States could still have achieved victory in Vietnam 
had Nixon truly been committed to it?  Of course he was not. But the point is, 
Kissinger had made it clear since 1967 that he believed the war could not be 
won.   </p>
<p align="left">     In private talks in 1968, Henry said that the "appropriate 
goal" of U.S. policy in Vietnam should be to permit a "decent interval" -- say, 
two or three years -- between the withdrawal of U.S. forces and a complete 
Communist takeover of the country! </p>
<p align="left">     In Vietnam, as in Korea before, the United States managed 
to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory.  We allowed (some say encouraged) the 
Communist buildup in the North.  We did nothing to profit the massive invasion 
of the South, and then, in "peace talks" in Paris, we permitted North Vietnam to 
leave 150,000 fully equipped troops in south Vietnam.  IT was a sufficient 
advantage to assure the Communists of their eventual victory.  So why on earth 
would the South Vietnamese accept a treaty which virtually guaranteed the 
conquest of their country? </p>
<p align="left">     CBS newsmen Marvin and Bernard Kalb, in their book <i>
Kissinger</i>, report that south Vietnamese President Nguyen van Thieu told 
Kissinger that the treaty was <i>not</i> acceptable. "To sign would be like 
surrendering to the Communists", they quote Thieu as protesting.  "It would make 
a mockery of the thousands of Americans and Vietnamese who died here."  But 
Thieu, whose spine was so weak it might have been transplanted from a jellyfish, 
finally cave in. </p>
<p align="left">     In the spring of 1975, Senator Henry M. Jackson and Admiral 
Elmo R. Zumwalt both claimed that Thieu agreed to accept the Paris accords only 
after President Nixon and Henry Kissinger promised him that the United States 
would "respond vigorously" to any Communist violations of the peace agreement.
</p>
<p align="left">     Within thirty days of the signing, of course, Hanoi began 
moving massive amounts of troops and equipment into South Vietnam -- and no aid 
was forthcoming.  But this cannot be blamed solely on Kissinger.  Congress 
finally bowed to pressures against any further support for a cause that the 
American Left had long assured the nation was lost anyway.   </p>
<p align="left">     The fact remains, however, that our allies counted on an 
American guarantee of aid and never got it.  Thieu's stated belief that the U.S. 
sold South Vietnam to the Communists rings disturbingly true. </p>
<p align="left">     The important question now is not whether the war could 
have been won.  It is, Why was the war needlessly prolonged?  Whether viewed 
from the perspective of the ultra-hawks, who argued for complete victory, or the 
ultra-doves, who demanded an immediate American withdrawal, there was no 
conceivable reason to prolong the Vietnam War, needlessly but deliberately. </p>
<p align="left">     Yet, that is exactly what resulted from Herr Henry's 
strange policies for over six years -- from 1968 until 1973 -- before the false 
peace.  Why the prolongation?  It makes no sense on the surface.  But like so 
much else in the sulphurous swamp of American foreign policy, a pattern can be 
detected if someone has the courage to explore beneath the surface. </p>
<p align="left">     We now know it was Kissinger himself who encouraged 
President Nixon to establish the White House "Plumbers Squad" that burglarized 
the offices of Daniel Ellsberg, the man who leaked the "Pentagon Papers" to the 
press.  A Jack Anderson column said the leak drove Kissinger to "near hysteria" 
and that he feared "disastrous consequences" from the Papers publication. </p>
<p align="left">     Why?  Despite some alarmist cries to the contrary, there 
was nothing in the "Pentagon Papers" that would have benefited the Communists 
very much.  Besides, Henry the K had already come to terms with our ostensible 
enemies.  What Super K feared was danger from a far different source. </p>
<p align="left">     The Schlafly-Ward writing team suggests that the real 
reason for Kissinger's alarm was something else entirely. </p>
<p align="left">What we did learn from the publication of the Pentagon Papers -- 
and obviously what Kissinger so feared we would learn -- was the existence of a 
powerful governmental conspiracy going back to the earliest Kennedy years, and 
the identity of the principal conspirators, of whom all the most influential 
were CFR members. </p>
<p align="left">What Kissinger really feared was the exposure of the purpose of 
the conspiracy, and the continuity of the conspiratorial campaign to effect the 
clandestine unilateral strategic disarmament of the United States <i>by means of 
the prolongation of the Vietnam War</i>. </p>
<p align="left">     As the "Pentagon Papers" clearly reveal, <i>none </i>of the 
persons who was responsible for establishing U.S. policy in Vietnam had any 
intention of letting the generals win that bloody conflict.  While the war was 
being prolonged, hundreds of billions of dollars were being wasted -- dollars 
that otherwise might have gone to weapons research and development. </p>
<p align="left">     But even more crucial, the devastating no-win conflict was 
used to divide Americans at home and to create a climate where "peace" on any 
terms -- even a total Communist takeover of Southeast Asia -- was acceptable.
</p>
<p align="left">     Schlafly and Ward believe the Ellsberg group within what we 
are calling the Shadow Government became alarmed, through their own naive 
assessment of the situation, that the original Nitze-McNamara-Gilpatric 
escalation of the war was actually aimed at <i>defeating</i> the Communists. 
 This was hardly the case:  Every step-by-step buildup on "our" side was 
carefully matched so that the "other" side (indirectly armed and equipped by the 
United States), could respond.  The idea clearly was not defeat but 
prolongation.  Yet the Ellsberg group and the American Left operated under the 
assumption that U.S. policy in Vietnam had actually become anti-Communist -- an 
incredible misreading of reality. </p>
<p align="left">     Ellsberg, who had been a protege of Kissinger and was once 
recruited by Henry to help formulate a new foreign policy regarding Indochina, 
should have known better. (Or perhaps he did, and was simply being used to 
destroy, once and for all, any hope for an anti-Communist triumph.) </p>
<p align="left">     Incredibly enough, by November 1975 Henry the K all but 
claimed that his deliberate betrayal of our Asian allies represented a <i>
victory</i> for us: </p>
<blockquote>
<p align="left">"One of the basic purposes of our original commitment in 
	Indochina was to provide a buffer of security and time fore the many nations 
	of Southeast Asia to enable them to develop their own strength and cohesion. 
	 In this regard our efforts proved successful. . . </p>
<p align="left">All of them are examples of self-reliance and national 
	resilience." </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left">     It is doubtful that anyone, including Kissinger himself, 
believed that the Communist conquests of Laos, Cambodia and south Vietnam helped 
produce "self-reliance" or "national resilience".  The message from Washington 
could not have been clearer.  Come to an accommodation with the Communist 
juggernaut or you will be ruthlessly and totally destroyed.  Every other nation 
in the Far East saw the handwriting on the wall. </p>
<p align="left">     For the anti-Communists who did not escape or refused to 
change sides, retribution was swift.  Paul Scott reported: </p>
<blockquote>
<p align="left">The killings by North Vietnamese and Viet Cong troops match 
	any of the highly played-up massacres committed by Hitler during World War 
	II.  In one instance, more than 400 helpless orphans and at least five nuns 
	in charge of the children were put to death by gunfire or beheaded. . . </p>
<p align="left">Aerial photographs taken of the China Beach area in early 
	April showed more than 30,000 bodies of South Vietnamese executed by the 
	Communists. . . </p>
<p align="left">Soviet-made trucks and tanks were used to run down fleeing 
	South Vietnamese refugees and destroy churches and schools in which the 
	refugees had taken haven. </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left">     According to Scott, at least one-quarter million vietnamese 
have been liquidated by the Communists since they seized control of South 
Vietnam.  To put that figure in perspective, remember that the country is 
smaller than the state of Missouri. </p>
<p align="left">     According to <i>Time </i>magazine of April 19, 1976, a 
similar slaughter is even now taking place in Cambodia: </p>
<blockquote>
<p align="left">"Since the Communist victory last year, an estimated 500,000 
	to 600,000 people -- one-tenth of Cambodia's population -- have died from 
	political reprisals, disease or starvation. . . </p>
<p align="left">To escape the bloodbath, at least 25,000 Cambodians have 
	fled across the border into Thailand.  They tell tales of people being 
	clubbed to death to save ammunition.  Others have been bound together and 
	buried alive by bulldozers, or suffocated by having plastic bags tied over 
	their heads." </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left">     Henry K has said nothing about such reports, of course. 
 Just as he has continuously disregarded that part of the Paris accord that 
required the Communists to account for some 2,300 Americans listed as Prisoners 
of War or Missing in Action.   </p>
<p align="left">     The Communists refused all help and information regarding 
these POWs and MIAs.  Instead they indicated the answers would not be 
forthcoming until the United States agreed to pay "reparations" totaling some $3 
billion. </p>
<p align="left">     The media in the United States have cooperated in the 
cover-up by ignoring both the fate of our missing soldiers and the slaughter of 
anti-Communist natives.  And the memories of most Americans are short.  If 
Walter Cronkite doesn't discuss it, it can't be important, can it? </p>
<p align="left">     Vietnam and Southeast Asia represent a complete rout for 
American foreign policy.  The results have been the enslaving of additional 
millions, the collapse of any remaining anti-Communist resistance in Asia, an 
enormous gain in prestige for the Communists, and an incredible drop in prestige 
for the United States. </p>
<p align="left">     Like the shark in <i>Jaws</i>, Communism has been made to 
appear invincible, unstoppable, inevitable.  But unlike that make-believe horror 
film, it is not because of its strength, but because of our weakness. </p>
<p align="left">     In june 1975, Kissinger was asked by <i>U.S. News and World 
Report</i>, "What effect has the Vietnam collapse had in the rest of the world?" 
 He replied: </p>
<blockquote>
<p align="left">"I think the sudden collapse of Vietnam brought home to a 
	lot of countries the central role of America and its foreign policy.  It led 
	to a profound concern in many countries about the conclusions we might draw 
	from that event". </p>

<p align="left">         Gerald Ford was actively campaigning for re-election to 
the Presidency by March 1976.  So it was not surprising that he had some tough 
things to say about the presence of 15,000 Cuban mercenaries in Angola, who were 
helping secure victory for the Soviet-backed faction in the rich African 
nation's civil war. </p>
<p align="left">     Secretary of State Henry Kissinger was also saying the 
right things -- or at least some of the right things.  He, too, was "distressed" 
that Communist cuba and the Soviet Union had intervened so blatantly in the 
newly independent nation.  In noe of his comments, though, did the Secretary 
even whisper a hope that a pro-Western faction might win.  But at least Super K 
had finally begun to admit that <i>something</i> was going wrong in the 
strategic African country. </p>
<p align="left">     As the <i>Los Angeles Times</i> editorialized on December 
17, 1975, until recently Herr Henry had pretended nothing at all was wrong: </p>
<blockquote>
<p align="left">In the five months since Kissinger has known of the Soviet 
	buildup [in Angola], he has behaved toward Moscow as if nothing were 
	happening, negotiating a new, long-term grain-sales agreement, forwarding a 
	new strategic arms pact, planning another Soviet-American summit as if <i>
	detente </i>were in no way threatened. </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left">     In fact, when Kissinger met with African foreign ministers 
at the United Nations several months earlier, he could not even bring himself to 
use the words "Soviet Union" in condemning the blatant intervention of Communist 
countries in Africa.  He intoned about "extracontinental powers" active on the 
continent. Tsk, tsk. </p>
<p align="left">     The <i>Times</i> could have added, but didn't that Henry K 
was also well aware of the fact that cuban troops had been pouring into Angola 
for months.  but rather than issue even a mild rebuke to Fidel Castro, Kissinger 
went charging right ahead with his plans to legitimize the Communist conquest of 
Cuba and even help his Comrades achieve their goal of a "de-Americanized" Panama 
Canal. </p>
<p align="left">     In the meantime, Henry's attitude about Angola appears to 
have pivoted a bit in recent years.  According to the <i>Chicago Sun-Times</i>, 
Kissinger had concluded back in 1969 that the national interest did not "justify 
consideration of U.S. military intervention" in Angola or any other country in 
Southern Africa.  But six years later the Secretary acknowledged that the 
Soviets were intervening on a massive scale, and he suggested that the U.s. 
should greatly expand its military assistance to the area. </p>
<p align="left">     But Henry the K was well aware -- he had to be -- that all 
anti-Communists had fled the area when "freedom" had been delivered on the point 
of a sword.  Who would we help?  The situation was so fouled up (or was it?) 
that the U.s. wound up being on the same side as Red China.  Both supported the 
National Front for the Liberation of Angola (FNLA). The other allegedly pro-West 
faction, the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (described in 
one government report as "twelve guys with knives"), also received some U.s. 
support. </p>
<p align="left">     But it was the Marxist Popular Movement for the Liberation 
of Angola (MPLA) which got the enormous backing of the Soviet Union and Cuba. 
 By 1976 the soviet Union was well on the way to establishing a client state in 
mineral-rich Angola.  The Soviets thumbed their noses at <i>detente</i>, and 
Kissinger made sure that they got away with it. </p>
<p align="left">     While Congress refused to deliver any further U.S. aid to 
any of the factions in Angola, President Ford refused to put any pressure on the 
Soviets -- such as threatening to withhold American grain shipments -- to 
curtail Soviet activities in the area.   </p>
<p align="left">     Henry explained that bartering with the U.S.-Soviet grain 
agreement would do "irreparable damage to <i>detente</i>, far in excess of 
anything the Angola issue might be worth". </p>
<p align="left">     So there we have the curious picture of our Secretary of 
State telling the Senate Foreign Relations Committee (on January 29, 1976) that
</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="left">"the effort of the Soviet Union and Cuba to take unilateral 
	advantage of a turbulent local situation where they have never had any 
	historic interests is a willful, direct assault upon recent constructive 
	trends in U.S.-Soviet relations and our efforts to improve relations with 
	cuba". </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left">     But he refused to permit anything to be done which would 
have deterred the Soviets or their Caribbean captives from their aggression. </p>
<p align="left">     You could practically hear the laughter all the way from 
Red Square.  Kremlin commentator Vikenty Matveev relayed the Politburo's views 
on Angola and <i>detente</i> when he declared, in December, 1975: </p>
<blockquote>
<p align="left">"The process of <i>detente</i> does not mean -- and will 
	never mean -- a freezing of the social and political status quo in the 
	world, or a halt to the anti-imperialist struggle. . . " </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left">     But why Angola? What are the stakes there? </p>
<p align="left">     The immediate goal is political.  As the <i>Richmond News 
Leader</i> recently summarized:  </p>
<blockquote>
<p align="left">"Strategically, Angola could be used as a base for attacks 
	on South West Africa.  A Communist-leaning Angola would be a threat to that 
	ultimate South African domino, South Africa. Control of southern Africa 
	would enable the Communists to cut the West's lifeline -- the sea lanes 
	along which oil must travel to reach Europe and the Western Hemispheres."
	</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left">     In his brief tenure as U.S. Ambassador to the United 
Nations, tough-talking Daniel P. Moynihan warned of the military threat that a 
Soviet Angola would pose.  In a sane world, such anti-Communist, pro-Western 
nations as south Africa and Rhodesia would be acknowledged as important allies 
of America. </p>
<p align="left">     But our kowtowing to "third world" mini-countries has meant 
watching from the sidelines as the United Nations branded Rhodesia "a threat to 
world peace" and demanded that the beleaguered country be boycotted.  </p>
<p align="left">     A previous ban on the importation of chrome ore from 
Rhodesia -- which made the U.S. totally dependent on the Soviet Union for this 
strategic mineral -- had been overturned in congress by the Byrd Amendment. but 
last October, President Ford and Secretary Kissinger pushed hard to repeal the 
amendment, which would re-impose the ban on Rhodesia chrome.  Happily, the House 
of Representatives defeated the bill, but the debate graphically revealed where 
Ford and Kissinger stood. </p>
<p align="left">     Before the limp-wristed State Department policy makers 
pulled the rug out from under him, Ambassador Moynihan had warned that, should 
communists take over Angola, they would "considerably control the oil shipping 
lanes from the Persian gulf to New York".  Not only that, he could have added, 
the Communists would have a lot more petrol of their own.  For once again, there 
are oily overtones to the whole picture. </p>
<p align="left">     As of 1974, the former Portuguese territory was already the 
fourth-largest oil producer in Africa.  Aside from its wealth in coffee, 
diamonds, iron ore, cotton, and grazing grounds, Angola -- which is twice the 
size of Texas and has a relatively sparse population of 6 million -- is known to 
possess untapped uranium and off-shore oil deposits.  it is, in a word, <i>rich</i>.
</p>
<p align="left">     Last year, a European political commentator named Pierre de 
Villemarest released this interesting report on events leading to the fall of 
Caetano government in Portugal (which led not only to the political turbulence 
in Portugal and the near-Sovietization of that country, but also made possible 
Portugal's surrendering of its overseas territories, including mineral-rich 
Angola): </p>
<p align="left">     In December 1971, David Rockefeller's Chase Manhattan Bank 
pressured Prime Minister Marcelo Caetano to accept its assistance.  At the same 
time, negotiations were going on between Lisbon and Washington, for the use of 
the Portuguese Azores as a military post.  According to Villemarest, chase 
Manhattan offered to help Lisbon in the negotiations and also pledged to bring 
in a flood of American investment dollars for the modernization and 
industrialization of Portugal.   </p>
<p align="left">     The bank also offered to use its "good offices" to see that 
Portugal would be admitted into the Common Market.  The price for all this help 
was high:  Caetano was to promise "rapid democratization" and a decolonization 
program to give Portuguese Africa independence within two years. </p>
<p align="left">     Caetano knew what the chaotic results of that might be.  He 
also knew that the Rockefellers were eyeing the oil resources of Cabinda and 
Angola.  He refused.  Within a few weeks he had been deposed, and scant months 
later an "independent" Angola was well along the road to being an official 
Soviet satellite. </p>
<p align="left">     But wait, there is more. </p>
<p align="left">     In February 1976, Gulf Oil Company reported that Henry 
Kissinger had given the company permission to pay the Soviet-backed regime in 
Angola about $100 million in oil royalties that gulf previously had placed in 
escrow.  Gulf holds the concession to operate the oil fields in Cabinda, and 
Angolan province separated from Angola proper by Zaire.  The $500 million annual 
royalty payment for the oil fields is the Angolan government's single largest 
source of income. </p>
<p align="left">     All of this, unfortunately, is only part of the 
ever-worsening picture. </p>
<p align="left">     As part of the Kissinger-maneuvered "Middle East peace" the 
Suez Canal is now open to the Soviet fleet -- but not the American Navy.  this, 
of course, meant an enormous strategic gain fore the Soviets, since it gave them 
(but not us) greatly increased access to the Persian gulf and Indian Ocean. </p>
<p align="left">     And there is still more: </p>
<p align="left">     In June 1975, then-Secretary of Defense James Schlesinger 
startled Congress with photographic evidence that the Soviet Union was building 
a missile base at Berbera, Somalia, in northeast Africa.  The port guards the 
entrance to the Red Sea and overlooks the oil routes between the Persian gulf 
and Europe. </p>
<p align="left">     The Communists scoffed at Schlesinger's warning, claiming 
that the photographs were actually of a large meat-packing plant.  But in July 
members of the House and Senate Armed Services Committees visited somalia and 
confirmed that the "meat-packing plant" was indeed a soviet military base.  Even
<i>Newsweek </i>reported that </p>
<blockquote>
<p align="left">"the legislators saw a huge missile-storage building, 
	complete with crates that apparently contained Soviet-made anti-ship Styx 
	missiles, a clearing for a new airfield and a communications station manned 
	by soviet personnel." </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left">     The Soviet build-up in Africa now includes military 
advisers in Guinea-Bissau, port and airfield rights in Guinea, advisers and arms 
in Equatorial Guinea, backup supplies in the Congo (Brazzaville), communications 
centers, airfield and naval facilities and the missile-storage sites in Somalia, 
and military aid to rebel forces in Nambia, a South African protectorate. </p>
<p align="left">     Ever since his appointment as National Security Adviser to 
the President, Henry Kissinger had maintained that the soviets placed "a low 
priority" on Africa -- particularly the central and southern portions of the 
continent.  Apparently very few officials dared challenge his views; after all, 
why would the Communists be at all concerned about the massive oil reserves, the 
uranium fields, the gold mines, the strategic ports, or the other rich mineral 
potential, when things were going so well for them to the north? </p>
<p align="left">     So while our attention was focused on the Middle East, and 
the apparent Soviet setbacks in Egypt, the Communists have been preparing the 
groundwork for a Communist <i>coup</i> from the Sahara to south Africa.  While 
all this goes on, it is super k's policy to treat any friends the U.S. has left 
in the area as enemies, while insisting that our avowed enemies be treated as 
friends. </p>
<p align="left">     Despite his occasional wrist-wringing, Herr Kissinger has 
made it clear that it is official United States policy to support black rule in 
Africa, no matter how violent or savage a regime's leaders might be.  And when 
super K declares that the U.S. "will give no encouragement to illegal regimes" 
in Africa, he -- and his listeners -- know that he is talking about Rhodesia and 
South Africa. </p>
<p align="left">     During his good will visit to six African countries in May 
1976, herr Henry was even more outspoken.  The United States will use 
"unrelenting" pressure against Rhodesia, he pledged, until that stable, 
anti-Communist government has collapsed. </p>
<p align="left">     When Kissinger finished describing a ten-point 
anti-Rhodesia program the Ford Administration is adopting, Zambia's communist 
dictator Kenneth Kuanda was so overjoyed he publicly embraced the Secretary of 
Ste.  Kissinger's program calls for, among other things, a U.s. boycott of 
Rhodesian chrome ore -- which would once more make us dependent on the Soviet 
Union for this strategic metal. </p>
<p align="left">     And as <i>detente </i>goes rolling right along, pity the 
poor official who gets in the way of it. </p>
<p align="left">     Daniel Moynihan spoke out forcefully at the United Nations 
about Soviet advances in Africa.  His comments about the Communists' "new 
colonialism", and his unkind remarks about Africa's native leadership, "third 
world" shenanigans, and Communist duplicity were not in keeping with the spirit 
of <i>detente</i>.  Friction with the State Department and even with Kissinger, 
his former mentor, was inevitable.  Soon Moynihan had resigned. </p>
<p align="left">     For Secretary of Defense James Schlesinger, who can hardly 
be accused of harboring rightwing sentiments, the price of his dissent was to be 
summarily fired after differing with Administration policy over <i>detente</i>.
</p>
<p align="left">     Even a close Kissinger friend, Establishment columnist 
Joseph Kraft, acknowledged on November 5, 1975, that </p>
<blockquote>
<p align="left">"Resentment of his [Kissinger's] power was so great that two 
	of the best men in the Administration -- Assistant Secretary of Defense 
	Robert Ellsworth and Assistant Secretary of the Treasury charles Cooper -- 
	have quietly resigned their jobs because they couldn't even get a hearing on 
	issues where they differed with Kissinger". </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left">     No one in government -- <i>no one</i> -- challenges 
Kissinger's "Grand Design" and gets away with it.  As a result, in Africa and 
elsewhere, the Red tide, like Ol' Man River, just keeps rolling along.  Henry K 
is making sure that no one can stop it. </p>

CIA</big></big> </a></p>
<p align="left">     The word "Watergate" was seared into the national 
conscience when, following President Nixon's carefully crafted landslide 
re-election in 1972, a series of innuendoes, rumors, and reports began to form 
an inescapable pattern.  It seemed incredible, but apparently persons intimately 
connected with the President had been involved in planning a break-in at 
Democratic headquarters during the Nixon-McGovern campaign.   </p>
<p align="left">     Then came the clincher:  The truth was being smothered at 
the very top level of government, possibly by the President himself. </p>
<p align="left">     The nation was subjected to a propaganda circus and a 
national agony unlike anything it had known before in this century.  Did a White 
House group engage in burglary?  Had a President lied to the public?  Before 
these questions were answered, incredible new disclosures made headlines. </p>
<p align="left">     The President's Oval Office was bugged, so that each and 
every conversation was on tape.  The tapes had not been destroyed.  And finally, 
they proved conclusively that President Nixon had deliberately staged a 
cover-up. </p>
<p align="left">     By the time the curtain was rung down, thirty persons 
linked to the President had been convicted.  President Nixon was forced to 
resign, and he was spared possible conviction only by a special pardon issued by 
the unelected new President, Gerald Ford. </p>
<p align="left">     The intriguing chain of events seemed to start when an 
elected Vice President, Spiro Agnew, was forced out of office.  an embattled 
President named a compromise stand-in choice -- Gerald Ford -- as Agnew's 
successor.  Then, an inner circle of close presidential advisers was eliminated 
in one fell swoop. the only person to remain in place, unscathed, was the most 
powerful figure in the White House besides the President:  Henry Kissinger. </p>
<p align="left">     Nixon's trusted lieutenants were replaced by men who were 
linked, one way or another, to the Rockefeller-Kissinger team. </p>
<p align="left">     Then, non-elected President Gerald Ford appointed the 
recently retired Governor of New York, Nelson Rockefeller, to be the nation's 
second non-elected Vice President.  And suddenly Nelson rockefeller, the most 
visible member of the House of Rockefeller, a man who salivated after the 
presidency with the ardor of a hunting dog on point, was within range of a 
target he had been chasing for two decades.  Hopelessly defeated in three 
previous presidential campaign, Rockefeller nevertheless was now the Vice 
President of the United States. </p>
<p align="left">     The House of Rockefeller had been the real power behind 
Richard Nixon for at least twelve years -- from the time in 1960 when Richard 
Nixon, with the Republican Presidential nomination already in the bag, flew to 
New York city to meet with Nelson Rockefeller. </p>
<p align="left">     Republicans everywhere understood the significance of the 
new Rockefeller-Nixon alliance.  Nixon had traded his independence for approval 
by the House of Rockefeller. </p>
<p align="left">     In 1968, Nixon followed the Rockefeller game plan to the 
letter.  For example, had he openly run on a platform promising to devalue the 
dollar, clamp wage-and-price controls on the economy, "open up" Red China, give 
away American wheat to the Soviets (in a deal which drove up prices at home), 
create countless new government agencies, promote the surrender of the Panama 
Canal, and greatly weaken our military posture, would he have been elected?  Not 
hardly. </p>
<p align="left">     But, the ploy was to run this "conservative, businessman's" 
candidate against Liberal Hubert Horatio Humphrey in 1968, and then in 1972 
against George McGovern, a man so far out in left field he was not really in the 
same ballpark.  by engineering the nomination of McGovern at one of the 
country's more outrageous conventions, the Nixon (read it Rockefeller-CFR) 
propagandists were able to elect Nixon <i>on rhetoric</i>. </p>
<p align="left">     But as usual, while the conservatives were paid in lip 
service, the Liberals got the action.  The dismantling of American sovereignty 
and the bankruptcy of the American economy continued at a dizzying pace under 
Nixon, while the CFR-Insiders made gigantic leaps toward their New World Order.
</p>
<p align="left">     So what went wrong?  If Nixon was a Rockefeller agent and 
had been doing his work so well for the boys in the backroom, why the need for 
his downfall?  We may never know for certain.  but with the benefit of new 
information and the 20-20 vision of hindsight, we can make some likely 
assumptions. </p>
<p align="left">     Rockefeller admittedly had wanted to be President since he 
first threw his baby rattle out of his crib. But, the office had eluded him for 
so long that the former young Republican reformer from New York was eligible to 
draw social security. </p>
<p align="left">     If Rocky were ever to realize his lifelong dream of sitting 
in the White House, had had to move fast.  And yet he knew that he was not 
overwhelmingly popular with the grass roots of his own party.  To become 
President, he needed to squeeze in through a crack in the back door. </p>
<p align="left">     We believe that Rocky expected Nixon to appoint him as Vice 
President when Agnew resigned.  Nixon, already under fire for Watergate, may 
have believed he could hang on to the Presidency by his fingernails by 
"stonewalling it".  But, he probably feared (correctly) that if Nelson were the 
Vice President, the heat would be turned even higher so that Nixon would have to 
resign, thereby making the Standard Oil heir President of the United States 
without having to go through the electoral process. So Nixon double-crossed 
Rocky and appointed Ford, Nixon, however, could not hang on and Ford became 
President and Rocky the Vice President,  Rocky was halfway home. </p>
<p align="left">     The first to fall in the Watergate scandals was the group 
of personal advisers Nixon brought with him to the White House.  These were men 
loyal to Nixon, not the Eastern Liberal Establishment.  And to the extent that 
this Palace Guard was <i>not</i> loyal to the Secret Government, it represented 
a potential danger. </p>
<p align="left">     These included, most particularly, H.R. Haldeman, White 
House Chief of Staff; John D. Ehrlichman, Assistant to the President; John Dean 
III, Counsel to the President; and, the men running the Committee to Re-Elect 
the President (perhaps appropriately referred to by its acronym, CREEP). When 
the smoke cleared, they were all gone. </p>
<p align="left">     Ehrlichman has been one of the most bitter victims of 
Watergate.  Sentenced to twenty months to five years in a federal penitentiary 
for his part in the break-in of the office of Daniel Ellsberg's psychiatrist, 
Ehrlichman said:   </p>
<blockquote>
<p align="left">"It's tough when we go to jail for the Ellsberg break-in and 
	the son-of-a-bitch who ordered it gets the Nobel Prize for Peace." </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left">     The S.O.B. referred to was, of course, Henry Kissinger. 
 Had Ehrlichman known the full story it is doubtful if his comments would have 
been as restrained! </p>
<p align="left">     In his book <i>Before the Fall</i>, former Nixon staffer 
William Safire revealed that Kissinger, one of the strangest appointments to the 
Nixon team, was perhaps the very <i>first</i> member of the Palace Guard to use 
wiretaps on a routine basis. </p>
<p align="left">     It is now known that the K had virtually every one of his 
conversations recorded.  Moreover, while National Security Adviser to Nixon he 
ordered taps placed on the phones of Richard F. Pederson and General Robert 
Pursley, who were, respectively, the closest aides of Secretary of State William 
Rodgers and Defense Secretary Melvin Laird. </p>
<p align="left">     It goes without saying that neither man was remotely 
considered as a security risk.  The taps were used, Safire reports, to give 
Kissinger a diplomatic advantage in the jockeying for power that was going on in 
the White House.  Safire notes: </p>
<blockquote>
<p align="left">"Complaining to a correspondent about the perfidy of his 
	archrival, Secretary of State Rogers, Henry then edited the transcript, 
	changing words to reflect stronger support of the President by Kissinger, 
	and then sent the revised version along to Haldeman -- an act of dishonor to 
	the unsuspecting reporter and an act of disloyalty to the President", </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left">     And he adds: </p>
<blockquote>
<p align="left">"A man who could do this was capable of eavesdropping on his 
	associates without scruple, and was capable of getting a special thrill out 
	of working most closely with those he spied upon most." </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left">     So eavesdropping was nothing new to Henry Kissinger, the 
man who acquired total control over White House intelligence even before 
Watergate.  But, as to Watergate itself -- who on earth planned it?  And why did 
they plan it? </p>
<p align="left">     What did the Nixon Republicans have to gain from the 
break-in?  The coming Nixon-McGovern contest was clearly as predetermined as a 
professional wrestling match; it was not a question of whether Nixon would win, 
but simply by <i>how much</i> of a margin.  there was absolutely no strategic 
reason to raid the Democratic headquarters. </p>
<p align="left">     Once the decision was made, however, you would think that 
the best men available would be used.  You'd expect, in short, a <i>professional
</i>job.   but the burglary at the Democratic headquarters in the Watergate 
Hotel was not exactly carried out with the slick precision of a James Bond 
movie.  It was about as smooth and professional as a Keystone Kops chase.  It 
was so clumsy, in fact, that the whole operation smelled of a set-up. </p>
<p align="left">     First, one of the burglars alerted a guard, by replacing 
the tape over the door locks after the guard had discovered and removed the 
first one.  Then, even though their efforts had been discovered, the bungling 
burglars incredibly were sent right back in.  The man posted as lookout saw the 
police enter the building, but either failed to alert the men inside or his 
warning was ignored.   </p>
<p align="left">     It was as though the burglars were supposed to be caught. 
 And when they were, one of them conveniently was carrying the White House 
telephone number of E. Howard Hunt in his pocket. </p>
<p align="left">     The inspiration for Watergate, it was later revealed, grew 
out of a secret inner White House group known officially as the Special White 
House Investigating Unit; but called simply, "the Plumbers".  The Plumbers were 
created by -- would you believe -- Henry Kissinger to stop leaks on his staff. 
 both Nixon staffers John Dean and Charles Colson have reported that Kissinger 
got Nixon so upset over leaks that the President decided, at Kissinger's 
suggestion, to set up the investigating unit.  John Dean goes even further, and 
charges that it was Nelson Rockefeller who had Kissinger sucker Nixon into 
forming the Plumbers.  Little did Nixon know that he was being mousetrapped. </p>
<p align="left">     Nationally syndicated columnist Paul Scott reports: </p>
<blockquote>
<p align="left">Records of the Senate Watergate Committee investigation 
	indicate that Dean's testimony concerning Rockefeller was never followed up 
	by the committee's staff.  The reason:  Committee members were against 
	calling Rockefeller. </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left">     Kissinger put a member of his staff, David Young, in charge 
of the unit.  Young was a Wall Street lawyer who had worked for Rockefeller 
before being promoted to Kissinger's staff.  After Watergate, Young was spirited 
off to a cushy assignment in London as a very advanced student, and the 
mediacracy has dutifully ignored his key role in Watergate. </p>
<p align="left">     So it was the activities of the Plumbers which brought the 
downfall of Richard Nixon.  but no one has <i>ever</i> claimed that Richard 
Nixon initiated or even authorized the illegal activities of his so-called 
supporters.  Why should he? </p>
<p align="left">  But, note that the man who <i>did </i>promote such illegal 
affairs -- the Rockefeller man who was growing more powerful every day -- 
emerged unscathed from the whole affair!  </p>
<p align="left">    Remember that Kissinger now ran <i>all </i>intelligence 
operations, and even the Central Intelligence Agency was under his thumb.  Is it 
any wonder that former White House aide Charles Colson has said that Nixon 
suspected the CIA was in the plot "up to their eyeballs". </p>
<p align="left">     Colson says Nixon wanted to fire the director of the CIA 
and personally investigate what was believed to be a CIA conspiracy against him.
</p>
<p align="left">     Nixon never got to investigate the Central Intelligence 
Agency.  Oh yes, the revelations about Watergate ultimately brought a closer 
look at the activities of the CIA.  but when a commission was finally brought 
together; seated at the chairman's spot was Nelson Rockefeller!!! </p>
<p align="left">     Despite its carefully crafted public image, the CIA is not 
now and for years has not been an anti-Communist agency.   </p>
<p align="left">     Watergate burglar E. Howard Hunt, possibly one of the few 
authentic anti-Communists within the CIA, revealed in his book <i>Undercover </i>
that he was one of the few pro-Goldwater conservatives in the Agency in 1964. 
 But he admits he executed orders to work <i>against</i> Goldwater to prove his 
"professionalism". </p>
<p align="left">     Former CIA employee Patrick J. McGarvey in <i>C.I.A., The 
Myth and The Madness</i>, admits: </p>
<p align="left">"seldom, if ever, will you find a CIA agent who is a dedicated 
anti-Communist". </p>
<p align="left">    Philip Agee, who was a highly regarded (and highly paid) CIA 
agent for twelve years, now works openly for world "socialist revolution".  In 
the early 1950s, it was CIA agents who broke into the offices of Senator Joseph 
McCarthy.  this came at the time the famous anti-Communist claimed he had been 
given evidence of pro-Communist infiltration, corruption, and dishonesty within 
the CIA itself. </p>
<p align="left">     McGeorge Bundy, who certainly should be able to recognize a 
fellow egghead when he sees one, has said that there are more Liberal 
intellectuals in "the Company", as CIA employees call their organization, than 
in any other agency of government. </p>
<p align="left">     This preponderance of eggheads, no doubt, explains why 
intelligence from the CIA has been so consistently <i>wrong</i> concerning 
communist plans or personalities.  It was the CIA, you'll remember, that first 
declared Fidel Castro was an anti-Communist; that said the East Germans would 
never try to build the Wall; that promoted Ahmed Ben Bella, Achmed Sukarno, Ho 
Chi-minh, Gamal Nasser, Patrice Lumumba, and literally scores of other Communist 
butchers. </p>
<p align="left">     With a record like this, an investigation is definitely 
called for.  But putting Nelson Rockefeller in charge of the inquiry is akin to 
inviting Wiley Coyote to babysit for infant Roadrunners.  (For the full story of 
Nelson Rockefeller's many years of service on behalf of the Communists, see this 
author's previous book, The Rockefeller File.) </p>
<p align="left">     Of the eight members of the commission, five were members 
of the Council on Foreign Relations, the Rockefeller-dominated Shadow 
government.   </p>
<p align="left">     Is it any wonder that Henry Kissinger was able to 
blue-pencil key information from the Commission's report? (for details, see 
chapter Eleven.) </p>
<p align="left">     Is it any wonder that the <i>Boston Herald American</i> 
could report on October 31, 1973: </p>
<blockquote>
<p align="left">"Federal investigators have obtained Central Intelligence 
	Agency documents that indicate former Director Richard Helms lied under oath 
	about his role in White House attempts to mask the Watergate burglary as a 
	CIA operations. . . </p>
<p align="left">The new evidence. . . indicates that Helms was behind the 
	CIA effort to limit the FBI probe." </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left">     Yes, the "fix" was put in at the top to protect the Central 
Intelligence Agency -- just as it was put in two years earlier to "get" Richard 
Nixon. </p>
<p align="left">     Nixon probably could have survived all of the rumors, 
speculations, and innuendoes about Watergate had it not been for one thing: 
 those damned tapes.  But in many ways, they are the most curious part of the 
whole story. </p>
<p align="left">     the fact that all of the President's conversations -- in 
fact, virtual all of his movements -- had been recorded was revealed almost 
casually at the Watergate hearings by Alexander butterfield, white House liaison 
with the Secret Service.  It is hard to believe that this bombshell, which was 
to remove a President, could be dropped with such an air of innocence.  Could it 
have been planned? </p>
<p align="left">     We now know that Butterfield had been a CIA informant.  He 
has been accused of working with (if not for) the CIA when he was in charge of 
all the tapings in the White House.  Had Blabbermouth Butterfield, who was 
called to testify about other matters -- not the tapes -- "stonewalled" it, 
Nixon would not have been forced to resign. </p>
<p align="left">     Why didn't Nixon have the tape machines shut off the day 
after the Watergate arrests?  Or, failing that, why didn't he destroy the tapes 
after butterfield revealed their existence?  Several rationalizations have been 
put forth, none of which rings true.  One is that Nixon was mesmerized by the 
arrogance of power and did not believe the supreme Court could or would subpoena 
the tapes.  Since there was no precedent, why take the risk?  Nixon must have 
known his very survival as President of the United States was at stake. </p>
<p align="left">     Remember, releasing the tapes would not exonerate Nixon, 
they would prove him guilty of every cover-up charge made against him.  why 
would this cunning politician, this ruthless abuser of power, this man from whom 
no one would buy a used car, not simply destroy the tapes himself? </p>
<p align="left">     Can anybody believe that Nixon sat there like a good scout, 
watching the lynch mob fasten a hangman's knot out of those wretched tapes, and 
refused to destroy the noose?  That isn't the Nixon depicted on the tapes -- 
much less in public life. </p>
<p align="left">     Why then did not Nixon, that ultimate political 
opportunist, burn the tapes?  We believe the only logical answer is that <i>
Nixon did not control the tapes</i>.   </p>
<p align="left">     Have you ever wondered how everybody seemed to know what 
was on the tapes, and where, before the were "turned over" to committee staffs, 
special prosecutors, or Judge Sirica? </p>
<p align="left">     Consider the fantastic detail involved in the requests. 
 Here is one sample: </p>
<blockquote>
<p align="left">January 8, 1973 from 4:05 to 5:34 P.M. (E.O.B.) </p>
<p align="left">a)  at approximately 10 minutes and 15 seconds into the 
	conversation, a segment lasting 6 minutes and 31 seconds. </p>
<p align="left">b)  at approximately 67 minutes into the conversation, a 
	segment lasting ll minutes; </p>
<p align="left">c)  at approximately 82 minutes and 15 seconds into the 
	conversation, a segment lasting 5 minutes and 31 seconds. </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left">     As Dr. Susan Huck observed in the February 1976 issue of 
American Opinion: </p>
<blockquote>
<p align="left">"It does sound as though somebody -- obviously not the 
	President -- has been curled up with those tapes for many a long hour, 
	doesn't it?  Somebody knows exactly where the juicy parts are, down to the 
	second." </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left">     Remember, all white House conversations -- in person and on 
the phone -- had been "bugged" for at least a year.  There were literally miles 
of tapes in storage somewhere.  but it is obvious the investigators already had 
the evidence they sought when the various subpoenas were issued! </p>
<p align="left">     Who then controlled the tapes, or had access to a duplicate 
set?  There is (understandably) very little information available on this 
crucial question.  Remembering that the Nixon tape monitors were established by 
the Secret Service, it is of more than passing significance that <i>Newsweek </i>
on September 23, 1974, reported: </p>
<blockquote>
<p align="left">While former white House chief of staff H.R. Haldeman awaits 
	trial for his part in Watergate, the Secret Service chief he ousted from the 
	White House last year has landed a plum job.  robert H. Taylor, 49, who 
	tangled with Haldeman over Nixon security procedures, is now head of the 
	private security forces for all the far-flung Rockefeller family 
	enterprises. </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left">     Hmmmm.  Once Nixon is deposed, the head of the Secret 
Service -- the man in charge of the agency which was in charge of the tapes -- 
gets a "plum job" with the Rockefeller empire. </p>
<p align="left">     What of the Rockefeller's number one man in the White 
House?  We know that Henry Kissinger was deeply involved in wiretapping his own 
staff and several journalists.  But the one member of the White House staff who 
apparently never had his remarks taped in the Oval Office was Herr Kissinger -- 
who also, as it happens, was chief of all U.S. intelligence gathering 
operations.  And who also, we no know, was responsible for establishing the 
Plumbers in the first place! </p>
<p align="left">     But through all of this, Kissinger's loyalty was not with 
the President, but with the Rockefellers!  Kissinger had been through three 
losing campaigns with Nelson Rockefeller and openly spoke of despising Nixon.  
</p>
<p align="left">     Biographer David Hanna quotes Kissinger as stating, after 
Nixon's nomination in 1968: </p>
<blockquote>
<p align="left">"That man is unfit to be President.  I would never work for 
	that man.  He is a disaster." </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left">     Watergate reporters Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward have 
revealed that Henry the K was often openly contemptuous of Nixon, referring to 
him in front of other White House staffers as "our meatball President" and 
delighting in passing on the most despicable gossip and confidences about the 
President and First Lady.  With a "friend" like Kissinger, you don't need any 
enemies! </p>
<p align="left">     Teaming up with Kissinger to administer the <i>coup de 
grace</i> to Nixon was another rockefeller man, General Alexander Haig.  Haig is 
an intriguing case.  Just as other associates connected with Kissinger jumped 
from virtual obscurity into key positions of influence (and as Kissinger himself 
had come out of nowhere into the second-most-powerful position in the Western 
world), Haig's meteoric career is as intimately linked to Henry the K as the 
latter's is to the Rockefellers. </p>
<p align="left">     Haig, a colonel when he joined Kissinger's staff in 1969, 
had been jumped to the rank of four-star general in four short years -- skipping 
the third star completely. </p>
<p align="left">     For a man with an absolutely undistinguished military 
record, this catapulting over 240 other general officers was most impressive 
indeed. </p>
<p align="left">     In the closing days of the Nixon Era, it was Haig who 
became more and more the acting President -- and it happens that it was 
Alexander Haig who controlled the vault where the Watergate tapes were kept. 
 Blabbermouth Butterfield, who tipped off the Watergate Committee to the 
existence of the damning tapes, was a former colleague of Haig. </p>
<p align="left">     Lloyd shearer in <i>Parade</i> magazine noted how Haig 
"orchestrated the resignation march" by taking the evidence against the 
President to that dwindling number of GOP congressmen who were still loyal to 
Nixon. the final decision to resign came after two sets of talks -- first, with 
Nixon's formerly loyal Republican confidantes, and second, with Henry Kissinger 
and Alexander Haig. </p>
<p align="left">     Those final months and days of Watergate have been 
variously described.  Kissinger himself has said that Nixon "barely governed" 
during his last months in office, that he had been an "odd and artificial man".
</p>
<p align="left">     Charles Colson has said that Nixon was a virtual "captive" 
of Haig and Kissinger during the final months in the Oval Office. </p>
<p align="left">     Curious, isn't it, that the three big Watergate winners 
turned out to be Gerald Ford, Nelson Rockefeller, and Henry Kissinger?  And is 
there <i>anyone</i> in America who truly believes that it is the President who 
tells the Vice President and Secretary of State what to do or say?  As columnist 
Paul Scott has said, Ford can no more fire Henry Kissinger than he can tell his 
wife Betty to shut up! </p>
<p align="left">     the man who got the whole thing started, of course -- who 
tapped the first telephone and toppled the first domino -- was Henry Kissinger, 
proving once again that no man can serve two masters.  Just as Haig had said 
that he "was never a Nixon man", Kissinger had boasted of Nixon, "I would never 
work for that man".  He didn't.  He was an agent for someone else. </p>

</p>
<p align="center"><a name="MOSCOWS_MAN_IN_WASHINGTON__"><big><big>MOSCOW'S MAN 
IN WASHINGTON?</big></big> </a></p>
<p align="left">     On August 14, 1975, during a press conference at the Hyatt 
House in Birmingham, Alabama,  Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger was asked a 
most embarrassing question.  The reporter asked: </p>
<blockquote>
<p align="left">"Mr. Secretary, we received a report that a Colonel General 
	Michael Goleniewski, who was a Polish Army intelligence officer in World War 
	II, had identified a list of KGB and GRU agents and officers who have since 
	been arrested, tried and convicted.   </p>
<p align="left">The General. . . also identified you, Mr. Kissinger, as 
	having worked for a Soviet intelligence network -- code name ODRA -- 
	headquartered in Germany <i>during</i> World War II, at the same time you 
	were a U.S. Army counter-interrogator and instructor in a military 
	intelligence school. . . </p>
<p align="left">Is this true?  And, if not, how do you explain your name 
	being on General Goleniewski's list?" </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left">     With characteristic aplomb, a seemingly unruffled Secretary 
of State replied:  "I don't know who Colonel Goleniewski is, but I think he 
should be given the Pulitzer Prize for fiction". </p>
<p align="left">     But thereby hangs a tale -- in fact, several of them. </p>
<p align="left">     To begin with, as the nation's top security man -- the 
funnel and sieve for<i> all </i>intelligence data to and from Washington -- 
Henry Kissinger surely <i>did </i>know who Colonel Goleniewski is. </p>
<p align="left">     First, as we shall see, Goleniewski was one of the most 
important defectors from the Communist intelligence apparatus ever to reach our 
shores.  His "debriefing" by the State Department and the CIA had taken years; 
in that time, Goleniewski had identified hundreds of double-agents and his 
record for accuracy was unmatched. </p>
<p align="left">     Moreover, rumors about Kissinger's recruitment by the KGB 
had been heard for years, and were the subject of hundreds, if not thousands, of 
inquiries to the State Department and the White House.  It is hardly possible 
that Henry K -- a man who collected gossip the way J. Paul Getty collected 
paintings -- had not heard about them. </p>
<p align="left">     The story actually began in the early 1950s, when a Colonel 
in Polish intelligence started supplying data on Soviet operations and agents to 
the Americans.  The man identified himself as Michael Goleniewski and said he 
was a staunch anti-Communist. </p>
<p align="left">     During the next decade, Goleniewski furnished U.S. agents 
with over 5,000 pages of top-secret documents, 160 microfilms of secret reports, 
800 pages of Soviet intelligence reports, the names of hundreds of Communist 
agents in Western Europe, and much more. </p>
<p align="left">     Then in 1961, fearing that his pro-U.S. activities had been 
discovered by the KGB, Goleniewski defected to the United States.  He arrived in 
this country on January 12, 1961, accompanied on a Military Air Transport plane 
by CIA agent Homer E. Roman. </p>
<p align="left">     State Department Security Officer John Norpel Jr. testified 
before the Senate Internal Security subcommittee that, of the copious 
information Goleniewski had supplied to the Americans during a <i>three-year</i> 
debriefing, <i>none</i> was found to be untrue or inaccurate.   </p>
<p align="left">     It is known that the Goleniewski revelations led, among 
many other things, to the exposure of the major sex-and-spy scandal in the U.S. 
 Embassy in Warsaw, the identification of Soviet agent Colonel Kolon Molody and 
four members of his cell in England, the exposure of the Swedish colonel Stig 
Eric Wennerstrom as a double agent and General in the Soviet KGB. </p>
<p align="left">     Goleniewski revealed that British Intelligence official 
George Blake was a Soviet spy, he identified scores of other KGB-GRU operatives 
in West Germany, Denmark, and France.  So valuable were his revelations that the 
88th Congress passed House Resolution 5507 to honor Goleniewski's contributions 
to American security and our intelligence efforts. </p>
<p align="left">     The Resolution said in part that Goleniewski "has 
collaborated with the government in an outstanding manner and under 
circumstances which have involved grave personal risk.  He continues to make 
major contributions to the national security of the United States.  His primary 
motivation in offering to work with the government has been and remains his 
desire to counter the menace of Soviet Communism". </p>
<p align="left">     In other word,s the man's credentials are absolutely 
impeccable.  He <i>was</i> a top-ranking communist intelligence agent; he <i>has
</i>exposed literally hundreds of communist agents in the West -- men who are 
deliberate traitors to the countries they pretend to serve. </p>
<p align="left">     And what is the point of this story?  Precisely this:  One 
of the men identified by Goleniewski in the early 1960s as a soviet agent was an 
unknown professor at Harvard named Henry A. Kissinger.  Here is the incredible 
account, as related by <i>American Opinion</i> contributing editor Alan Stang in 
the march 1976 issue of that magazine: </p>
<blockquote>
<p align="left">     In the days following World War II, the Soviets had 
	organized an ODRA spy ring in Poland.  Its main purpose was to penetrate 
	British and American military intelligence.  ODRA was directed by a Soviet 
	general named Zelanznikoff; its local chief was a Colonel Kujun.   </p>
<p align="left">     In 1954, Kujun was ordered to Moscow to explain the 
	mysterious murder of a female Soviet courier and the disappearance of 
	important material, including 480,000in intelligence funds.  Fearing he 
	would be shot, Kujun tried to commit suicide but instead wound up in a 
	hospital run by the GZI, the Polish equivalent of the Russian KGB. </p>
<p align="left">     The GZI chief, a Colonel Wozniesienski, interrogated 
	Kujun at length.  He stored the results of his investigation in his safe. 
	 Wozniesienski was later replaced by a Colonel Skulbaszewski, who himself 
	was replaced in 1956 by Goleniewski.  the "Polish" agent told Stang he 
	inherited Skulbaszewski's office, files, and safe -- the latter containing 
	some 1500 pages of documents. </p>
<p align="left">     About twenty pages of these documents were in Russian, 
	in Wozniesienski's handwriting.  They dealt with the interrogation of 
	Colonel Kujun in 1954 and included a list of the true names, as well as the 
	code names, of ODRA' principal agents in Europe </p>
<p align="left">     One such spy was Ernst Bosenhard, who had been employed 
	as a clerk at the U.S. Intelligence Headquarters in Oberammergau, Germany. 
	 Bosenhard had sent untold numbers of top-secret documents on to Moscow 
	before he was arrested and convicted of espionage in 1951.   </p>
<p align="left">     Another name on Wozniesienski's OKRA list was the agent 
	"Bor", who had worked with Bosenhard in Oberammergau.  A 1954 update 
	indicated that "Bor" had returned to the United States, was presently at 
	Harvard University, and was secretly working with the Central Intelligence 
	Agency. </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left">     According to the list, "Bor's" real name was Sgt. Henry A. 
Kissinger.  Stang then reports the following conversation he had with 
Goleniewski: </p>
<blockquote>
<p align="left">"Were you actually present when the KGB opened Colonel 
	Skulbaszewski's safe?" </p>
<p align="left">"Well, I opened Colonel Skulbaszewski's safe." </p>
<p align="left">"You opened it yourself?" </p>
<p align="left">""Right." </p>
<p align="left">"And in Colonel Skulbaszewski's safe there was a list of 
	Soviet agents -- and on that list was the name: Henry Kissinger." </p>
<p align="left">"Right." </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left">Goleniewski also told Stang: </p>
<blockquote>
<p align="left">"At this time I learned about Sergeant Kissinger, Sergeant 
	Kissinger was for me a quite nobody.  I didn't know who he was.  I didn't 
	know was he a Jew, or was he German, or what hell he was.  What I knew, that 
	he got to be for one reason or another involved in counter-intelligence 
	Smersh network of Soviets under code name "Bor", and it happened sometimes 
	in Germany after he came with American Army.  And in '61 for me it was one 
	of hundred cases.  I didn't pay no attention.  Such cases they really 
	existed hundreds, you see." </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left">     If there is even the most remote possibility that these 
charges are true, how could Kissinger have received any government post, much 
less rise to the exalted position he holds today?  First, remember that by 1968, 
Goleniewski's revelations had been buried deep in the bowels of the government's 
security agencies.   </p>
<p align="left">     Moreover, Nixon was so anxious to get Kissinger on the job 
that the President waived the normal security check on Henry.  By the time the 
issue was raised, Kissinger was King of the Hill so far as security was 
concerned; he told the investigators whom to investigate. </p>
<p align="left">     Yes, it <i>can</i> happen. . . and has.  thirty years ago 
Alger Hiss proved that a Soviet spy could sit at the right hand of a President. 
 Just two years ago, West German chancellor Willi Brandt was forced to resign 
when it was revealed that one of his top aides, Gunter Guillaume, was a 
Communist spy.  Gullaume had fooled West German security -- which is <i>very</i> 
conscious of communist infiltration techniques -- for years. </p>
<p align="left">     There have been efforts to dismiss Goleniewski's charges as 
"mis-information" carefully planted by the KGB.  One author, Richard Deacon, 
even suggests in <i>The Chinese Secret Service</i> that the KGB was willing to 
sacrifice such key agents as Wennerstrom, Blake, Molody and Krogers to enhance 
the false defector's credibility. </p>
<p align="left">     Such a charge assumes that the Soviets regard Henry the K 
as a dangerous anti-Communist adversary.  But as we have seen, precisely the 
opposite is true!  Henry is, at the very least,  one of their most trusted 
friends and colleagues. </p>
<p align="left">     Moreover, Goleniewski's charges date back at least twelve 
years -- long before Henry the K had achieved any national position or prestige. 
 It is the fact that Goleniewski named Kissinger as a Soviet agent so long ago, 
when there was no Kissinger axe to grind, which leads us to believe the charge 
is true. that, and the Kissinger record during the past eight years. </p>
<p align="left">     But intriguingly, except for a few accounts in small 
intelligence journals, the major media have refused to touch the Goleniewski 
allegations with a ten-foot pole.  Perhaps his believability was tarnished when 
a New York newspaper identified the "Polish" defector as the son of Czar 
Nicholas II of Russia. </p>
<p align="left">     On June 11, 1971, the <i>New York Daily Mirror </i>
announced the exclusive publication of <i>Reminiscences and Observations</i> by 
"His Imperial Highness Aleksei Nicholaevich Romanoff, Tsarevich and Grand Duke 
of Russia', son of Nicholas II and survivor of the alleged Communist massacre of 
the Russian royal family. </p>
<p align="left">     H.I.H. Aleksei romanoff and Michael goleniewski were one 
and the same man!  According to the <i>Daily Mirror</i>, former CIA Chief of 
Research and Analysis Herman E. Kimsey, in an affidavit signed June 3, 1965, had 
verified the man's identity on the basis of fingerprints sole prints, dental and 
medical records, handwriting tests, blood tests, and recognition and 
confrontation with childhood friends and relatives. </p>
<p align="left">     Recent documents released by the British government lend 
credence to Goleniewski's claims.  The Royal family of Russia apparently was not 
murdered by the Bolsheviks as had been widely believed.  The Czar and his family 
were spirited out of Russia by British agents, but were afraid to make the fact 
that they were still alive known.  Doubtless they hoped that the Bolshevik 
government would collapse and they could return to Russia.  Little did they know 
that the West would send critical transfusions of food, money, and technology to 
keep the bloody Bolsheviks in power. </p>
<p align="left">  Perhaps we can get a better perspective by noting that the 
chief prosecution witness, Michael Goleniewski, has already testified under oath 
and has said he would be delighted to repeat his charges in a trial of Henry 
Kissinger.  While the defendant in this instance, Henry Kissinger, dismisses the 
whole matter with a joke. . . and a lie. </p>
<p align="left">     At the very least, congress should investigate these 
charges -- perhaps as part of a larger study of the Kissinger record.  When such 
a hearing is called, we hope the Congressmen will also look into the other 
quacking creatures in the Kissinger barnyard. </p>
<p align="left">    This would include, for example, Wilfred Burchett, the 
Australian communist who was deprived of a passport by his own government 
because of his aid to the communists in the Korean War.  burchett was welcomed 
to Washington by Kissinger in 1971 for "consultations" on the Vietnam War.  the 
man who helped secure phony "germ warfare" confessions from Allied prisoners 
during the Korean War was one of Hanoi's most trusted emissaries. </p>
<p align="left">     How jolly.  Just what was said we'll never know.  But for 
Kissinger to base any part of the negotiations on statements by Burchett is the 
equivalent of consulting Al Capone on how to clean up crime in chicago! </p>
<p align="left">     a much more important Kissinger contact is the mysterious 
Victor Louis, one of Moscow's most trusted -- and most important -- KGB agents. 
 Kissinger is reported to have met secretly with Louis in the Soviet Embassy in 
London just after his first trip to Red China.  "Victor Louis" is, in reality, 
Vitaly Yuvgenyevich Lui, who operates under the cover of being the Moscow 
correspondent for the <i>London Evening News</i>. </p>
<p align="left">     Even a casual scrutiny of Kissinger's colleagues and 
collaborators at the State Department reveals an amazing similarity in the way 
the flock looks, walks, and quacks.  Among the many things they all have in 
common is an unswerving devotion to detente, downgrading U.S. defenses, 
undercutting our national security, courting the Soviets, and aiding the 
communist world. </p>
<p align="left">     One of the key Kissinger appointees, for example, is Helmut 
sonnenfeldt, a long-time State Department official who is now in charge of trade 
with the Communists. </p>
<p align="left">     A chum dating back to Kissinger's soldiering days in 
Germany, sonnenfeldt is known to have been the subject of espionage 
investigations.  According to intelligence expert Frank Capell, three former 
U.S. Foreign Service officers have testified under oath that in the 1950s 
sonnenfeldt turned over secret information to "agents of a foreign power". 
 Capell says that Sonnenfeldt also compromised U.S. codes, and that security 
officers recommended his prosecution. </p>
<p align="left">     Sonnenfeldt's nomination for a high Treasury Department 
post had to be withdrawn several years ago when it became known that witnesses 
were seeking to testify that Sonnenfeldt had committed perjury during the 
confirmation hearing on his nominations. </p>
<p align="left">     But even though Sonnenfeldt has been labeled a security 
risk, Henry the K got his buddy "cleared" through the Office of Security.  How? 
 by putting Jesse MacKnight in charge of the clearing.  MacKnight was sure to be 
sympathetic -- he had been identified in the past as an operative for Soviet 
intelligence and had provided Soviet spy Judith Caplan with government reports. 
 CFR member Sonnenfeldt was sure to feel safe with MacKnight in charge of 
catching subversives. </p>
<p align="left">     sonnenfeldt is the only member of Kissinger's coterie who 
attends those closed-door conferences with Soviet Ambassador Dobrynin.  Of 
course sonnenfeldt worked closely with Kissinger in Moscow on the SALT I 
agreements.  It is Sonnenfeldt who said that no efforts should be made by us -- 
or permitted by others -- to free the Captive Nations, and characterized a 
yearning to be free by Poles as "romantic political inclinations." </p>
<p align="left">     MacKnight and sonnenfeldt were hardly the only security 
risks helping forge the Kissinger Team.  Not by a long shot.  Kissinger arranged 
for William O. Hall, known to security officers as an associate and contact of 
known Communists and soviet agents, to be named as Director General of the U.s. 
Foreign Service, although he had been identified as a serious security risk as 
far back as 1956. </p>
<p align="left">     Hall was safe as houses until The Review of the News 
exposed his background in 1972.  Hall then decided to retire, and Kissinger 
selected James S. Sutterlin to replace him.  sutterlin had been "intimately 
linked" with Edward Kelley, security officer at the U.S. Embassy in Warsaw 
during the sex-and-spy scandals involving soviet agents and other diplomatic 
personnel. </p>
<p align="left">     While serious security risks received promotion after 
promotion in Henry Kissinger's State Department, known anti-Communists were 
being purged. </p>
<p align="left">     One of the men "selected out", as the euphemism goes, was 
career officer John D. Hemenway.  Hemenway was a victim of an obvious conspiracy 
which used false reports and dishonest job ratings to get him removed.  Unlike 
many others who just went quietly, however, Hemenway appealed.  The hearings 
completely exonerated Hemenway, who was recommended for reinstatement, a 
promotion, and apology, and even reimbursement for legal expenses.  but 
Kissinger's good friend director General William Hall reversed the board's 
decision.  And the purge went on. </p>
<p align="left">     Another SALT man and top-ranking intelligence officer on 
the Kissinger team is boris Klosson.  It was Klosson who, as U.s. counselor for 
political affairs in Moscow in 1961, cleared the way for Lee Harvey Oswald's 
return to the United States.  It is know that Oswald, the so-called "lone 
assassin" of John Kennedy, had attended a KGB school for nearly two year.   </p>
<p align="left">     Given the Soviets' track record of introducing agents into 
foreign countries, it is hard to imagine that Oswald's claim of a change of 
heart could convince such a career officer. (And if Oswald really had a sincere 
change of heart, does it make sense that the Russians would have allowed him to 
leave the country?) </p>
<p align="left">     It's less puzzling, perhaps, when we note that in a recent 
State Department appeal case, a Foreign Service officer told how Klosson 
thwarted him from sending a report back to Washington dealing with KGB 
operations against Americans in russia. </p>
<p align="left">     And then there is the incredible case of Kissinger's 
selection as U.S. ambassador to Chile.  Kissinger tapped ultra-Leftist David 
Popper to represent us in a country which had just overthrown the first elected 
Communist government in Latin America. </p>
<p align="left">     Popper, who had been affiliated with the subversive 
Institute of Pacific Relations, had been recruited into the State Department by 
Alger Hiss.  He also served on the editorial board of <i>Amerasia</i>, the 
magazine which was later revealed to be the center of a Soviet espionage ring.
</p>
<p align="left">     Our Secretary of State's selection for U.S. Ambassador to 
the Republic of China -- that is, Free china -- was even more outrageous.  It 
was none other than Leonard Unger, our former ambassador to Thailand, the man on 
the scene during the strangely contrived overthrow of the anti-Communist 
government of Prime Minister Thanom Kittikachorn. </p>
<p align="left">     More than two decades ago, a former Soviet agent named 
elizabeth Bentley shocked a congressional Committee when she testified that the 
Soviets were operating four spy rings within the U.S. government.  Only two of 
the rings were ever exposed.  According to one security agency, one of the two 
rings not exposed operated in the european Affairs section of the State 
Department; the confidential report identified six persons, including Leonard 
Unger, as members. </p>
<p align="left">     At least one of Kissinger's close contacts admits to being 
a communist.  That is the man the FBI once identified as the top KGB operative 
of them all -- Soviet Ambassador Anatoly Dobrynin, the head of all KGB 
operations in the United States. </p>
<p align="left">     It is now know that the Rockefeller commission 
investigating CIA activities (which is akin to Jesse James investigating the 
Daltons) heard testimony which revealed an intricate KGB espionage network on 
Capitol Hill.  the Soviets even had the capability of intercepting White House 
and Congressional telephone calls!  What did Kissinger do about this misbehavior 
by his friends?  He ran interference for them! </p>
<p align="left">     <i>Newsweek</i> magazine reported on august 25, 1975: </p>
<p align="left">"Henry Kissinger's anxiety to avoid strains on U.S.-Soviet 
relations extended to editing the Rockefeller commission's study of intelligence 
activities.  The original draft of the. . . report contained a lengthy section 
on Soviet espionage in the U.S., including the KGB's ability to intercept White 
House communications via special antennas on the Russian Embassy roof.  this 
passage was excised from the Rockefeller report when it was reviewed by the 
National Security Council, which Kissinger heads." </p>
<p align="left">     By mid-1975, both the Rockefeller Commission and a 
committee chaired by Senator Frank Church were investigating both the CIA and 
FBI.  but anyone who believes the committees were concerned with Communist 
activity in this country would be sadly mistaken. </p>
<p align="left">     Clearly, the committees were out to get the <i>anti</i>-Communists. 
 What remained of American internal security was swiftly going down the drain as 
Super K achieved power over the nation's intelligence community.  The record is 
clear:  The Justice Department's Internal Security division was abolished in 
March 1973; the Subversive Activities Control Board was dismantled three months 
later; in 1974 the Attorney General's List of Subversive Organizations was 
eliminated; January 1975 the House Internal Security Committee was abolished.
</p>
<p align="left">     So this is what the picture looks like, in this 
Bicentennial Year celebrating 200 years of freedom:  As the Communist military 
menace expands because of Kissinger's secret diplomacy at the Strategic Arms 
Limitations Talks, the United States has slipped -- or been pushed -- into 
number two position.  And as communist infiltration and penetration of this 
country increased, the ability of U.S. security forces to maintain surveillance 
on such infiltration decreased. </p>
<p align="left">     Security -- at least Western security -- doesn't seem to 
bother Henry K one little bit. </p>
<p align="left">     But with the Kissinger Team in charge -- men like Hall, 
Sonnenfeldt, Klosson, Popper, Bunker, and all the others -- captained by an 
arrogant egoist who is a <i>proven</i> liar and an accused KGB agent, do we 
really need to worry about any <i>foreign enemies</i>? </p>
<p align="left">     It is not difficult to agree with William Loeb, maverick 
publisher of the Manchester (New Hampshire) Union-Leader, who wrote: </p>
<blockquote>
<p align="left">"Perhaps Kissinger really is a communist agent.  Certainly, 
	he could not do any more harm to the United States or any more good for the 
	Soviet Union if he were!" </p>
</blockquote>

<p align="left">EXCERPTS: (remember, this was written in 1976) </p>
<p align="left">     What can one say about the Middle East?  It is a riddle 
wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma.  It is a pail of snakes and a bucket of 
worms.  God knows how it will all end.  But, one this is certain:  The Middle 
Ease is a time bomb ticking away, and the United States is arming both Israel 
and the Arabs with the world's most sophisticated weapons. </p>
<p align="left">     Henry Kissinger's Middle East peace plan calls for 200 
Americans to staff three electronic warning stations located in the Sinai desert 
between the Arabs and Israelis.  Could there be a better way to get us involved 
in a Mideast War?  What happens if one side or the other attacks and kills those 
Americans?  Or what if one side wipes out a town or a garrison on the other side 
-- and the U.S. is blamed for not alerting the victims?  Does it all sound too 
much like the Tonkin Gulf incident, which was used to ram through a House 
Resolution authorizing our involvement in Vietnam? </p>
<p align="left">-------------------------------------------------------- </p>
<p align="left">     At least this is what Henry Kissinger and his masters in 
the Shadow Government hope has happened. <b>If America has lost the will to 
resist, then our collapse -- and the triumph of Kissinger's New World Order -- 
are inevitable. </b> </p>
<p align="center"><a name="THE_IMPACT_OF_KISSINGER__"><big><big>THE IMPACT OF 
KISSINGER</big></big> </a></p>
<p align="left">      The deteriorating world situation is one most people would 
rather not think about.  Surely, somehow we will muddle through.  doesn't God 
watch over drunks, small children, and the United States of America?  Our 
citizens have fretted about Communism for so long we are tired of fretting.  the 
tragic Vietnam war drained our emotional reserves.  Now most of us don't want to 
think about international affairs.  Maybe <i>detente</i> will work. Maybe the 
Communists have lost their zeal and will settle for live-and-let-live 
coexistence with America.  And maybe cows can fly. </p>
<p align="left">     Sure, we can dream.  But dreaming is very dangerous while 
driving.  We had better wake up before the national automobile goes careening 
off the road. </p>
<p align="left">     Let's look at what has happened during the eight years 
Kissinger has held the reins of power in Washington. We know that this protege 
of the Rockefeller family was carefully trained and coached by his oily 
benefactors for his position in the Nixon Administration. </p>
<p align="left">     Remember that Nelson sent Henry off to Washington with a 
$50,000 "gift" in his wallet.  Even if we dismiss the possibilities that 
Kissinger has been a double-agent, serving the Soviets since the end of World 
War II (and this is certainly a charge which merits thorough investigation), it 
is undeniable that Kissinger is a paid agent of the House of Rockefeller, and 
has been since his days at Harvard. </p>
<p align="left">     Moreover, it is beyond dispute that the chief goal of the 
Rockefeller family is the creation of what they call a New World Order.  This 
phrase is used over and over again by the Rockefellers and their agents and 
allies in the Shadow Government, including Henry A. Kissinger.  Herr Henry can 
barely finish a paragraph, much less a whole speech, without using this key 
phrase two or three times. </p>
<p align="left">     The Rockefellers do not even bother denying that World 
Government is their goal.  Nelson acknowledged as much in a book called <i>The 
Future of Federalism</i>, in which he boldly stated that national independence 
is outmoded and must be replaced by an international super-government.  the 
book, first published in 1963, has been reissued since Rocky became Vice 
President.  The Rockefellers do not need to keep their plans secret; they know 
that the mass media won't blow the whistle on them.  When you own the referees, 
you don't need to worry about the American public upsetting the game plan for a 
New World Order! </p>
<p align="left">     During his nearly eight years at the helm of American 
foreign policy, Kissinger has diligently pursued the Rockefeller plan for a 
Great Merger into a New World Order. </p>
<p align="left">     The master planners running the show know that American are 
not going to surrender their sovereignty -- unless they feel there is simply no 
other alternative.  In order to create the psychological atmosphere within 
America for acceptance of the New World Order, the Shadow Government has had to 
build the Soviet Union into a credible threat. </p>
<p align="left">     Achieving this has taken bluff and bluster, and literally 
billions of dollars in aid and trade.  but it has finally been accomplished. 
 When Kissinger told Admiral Zumwalt that America is comparable to Athens, while 
the Soviet Union is Sparta, he was describing the position that he has labored 
to create!  Once the machines of mass misinformation in the media convince 
enough Americans that this is indeed the case, the next step will be the 
argument that the best deal we as Athens can get is to merge in a world 
government with Sparta.  And the trusting, gullible American public will 
reluctantly conclude that this must be true. </p>
<p align="left">     Kissinger has consistently promoted programs to build up 
the Soviet Union, by transferring critical technology to Russia and by making 
billions of dollars in loans and credits available to the Soviets.  Once he had 
taken control of foreign policy, Henry the K could then hit freedom with a 
double-whammy.  At the same time he was turning on the electricity to activate 
the communist Frankenstein, he was turning off the current to the monster's 
victims.  Or, to switch analogies in midstream, Henry has provided guns to the 
neighborhood hoodlums and then told the local merchants not to bother him with 
their new problems. </p>
<p align="left">     Most Americans still do not realize what Kissinger and his 
masters are arranging for them, or what they have already arranged for others. 
 but when Vietnam was personally giftwrapped for the communists by our Nobel 
Peace Prize-winning Secretary of State, the non-Communists in Asia saw the Red 
handwriting on the wall.  The fact that Henry was actually in Peking on the very 
day that the Nationalist chinese -- the staunchest anti-Communists in Asia, and 
our one-time allies -- were kicked out of the United Nations, made the signals 
unmistakably clear.  Japan, the Philippines, and other Asian nations, realizing 
the implications of their corner of the world being dominated by Maoland, began 
clamoring for the best deal they could get with the Communists. </p>
<p align="left">     Free China is abandoned and stranded; the courageous people 
there are being left to turn slowly, slowly in the wind.  with socialist India 
already a quasi-Soviet satellite, and the Suez Canal open to the Soviet fleet, 
the Indian Ocean is being turned into a Red lake.  No opposition to communist 
imperialism can be expected from that part of the world. </p>
<p align="left">     The ship of western civilization has been deliberately 
torpedoed in Africa, and is sinking now.  secretary of State Kissinger helped 
fire the crucial shot when he encouraged the fall of Portugal from the ranks of 
anti-Communist nations, thereby leaving the Portuguese territories in Africa 
ripe for plucking.  Angola and Mozambique were swallowed almost at once.  It is 
probable that Rhodesia will be the next to fall.  And then beleaguered south 
Africa will be the only outpost against communism on the continent, left without 
friends, without aid, and without hope; how long will it remain free? </p>
<p align="left">     The picture in europe is hardly brighter.  England is 
destitute and decadent, the victim of decades of socialism foisted upon it by 
limousine liberals and rule-or-ruin union leaders.   </p>
<p align="left">    In France, the Communists now have the country's 
second-largest political party and through a coalition with other socialist 
parties, could come to power at any time. </p>
<p align="left">     The same situation prevails in Italy.  Thanks to our inept 
policies, the U.S. Navy is no longer welcome in Greece. As a result of the 
Soviet buildup and defaulting by U.s. policy-makers, the Mediterranean is now 
thoroughly dominated by the Russian Navy. </p>
<p align="left">     What can one say about the Middle East?  It is a riddle 
wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma.  It is a pail of snakes and a bucket of 
worms.  God knows how it will all end.  But, one this is certain:  The Middle 
Ease is a time bomb ticking away, and the United States is arming both Israel 
and the Arabs with the world's most sophisticated weapons. </p>
<p align="left">     Henry Kissinger's Middle East peace plan calls for 200 
Americans to staff three electronic warning stations located in the Sinai desert 
between the Arabs and Israelis.  Could there be a better way to get us involved 
in a Mideast War?  What happens if one side or the other attacks and kills those 
Americans?  Or what if one side wipes out a town or a garrison on the other side 
-- and the U.S. is blamed for not alerting the victims?  Does it all sound too 
much like the Tonkin Gulf incident, which was used to ram through a House 
Resolution authorizing our involvement in Vietnam? </p>
<p align="left">     There is one continent where the communists suffered 
defeats during the past eight years:  South America.  In both Brazil and Chile, 
openly Marxist rulers were tossed out and replaced by anti-Communists.  You 
would think that America's leaders would be thankful; instead, Henry the K has 
criticized the new governments far more harshly than he did their Communist 
predecessors.   </p>
<p align="left">     And other countries, looking to see what the might colossus 
to the north will do next, are aware that Kissinger intends to legitimize the 
Castro regime and surrender control of our Panama Canal to Panamanian dictator 
Torrijos, a Communist puppet.  Letting the Canal fall under anti-American 
domination will be the signal to other South American countries that they too 
had better scramble to get the best deal they can in the New World Order. </p>
<p align="left">     Take a look at the globe and you can see the kettle of fish 
Henry has prepared for us.  The natural resources of the world and the sea lanes 
to transport them increasingly are controlled by the Communists.  The 
implications of the Suez Canal, the Panama Canal, the Cape of Good Hope, the 
Indian Ocean, and the Mediterranean Sea being closed to U.S. shipping are 
enormous.  And, the Soviets are going for the jugular.  when Argentina decides 
that Athens is capitulating to Sparta and elects to take sides with the apparent 
winner, the noose would be cinched. </p>
<p align="left">    Operating behind the cloak of detente the Soviets are 
expanding their spheres of interest and are devoting more and more of their 
resources to converting the technology <i>we </i>supply them into military goods 
and weapons.  At the same time, more and more of our military budget is being 
spent on salaries and fancy padding, not weapons research and development. </p>
<p align="left">The military has purchased from their new <i>partners</i>, 
weapons to contain the populations of the countries, in order to "maintain 
internal peace", as stated in the Arms Control and Disarmament Act. "Non-lethal" 
weapons, they are called, to put down civil uprisings; conduct "urban warfare" 
should the unlikely situation arise that citizens today would actually rise up 
and say "NO"; crowd control, and the technology to watch, track and listen to 
our every move. It isn't too late.  It just looks that way.  With Creator/God 
All things are possible. - Jackie} </p>
<p align="left">       In retrospect, it may turn out that the Vietnam War was 
the worst disaster ever to befall the United States.  The war could have been 
won -- or lost -- very quickly.  Even if we had decided to toss in the towel in 
Vietnam, as the French did before us, the United States still could have 
survived.  But, to fight a war for twelve years -- pulling our punches all of 
the time -- and then to walk away, letting the Communists overrun the country, 
is unquestionably the worst of all possible worlds. </p>
<p align="left">     Look what the "no-win" Vietnam war did to America.  First, 
it badly dislocated our economy, triggering a wave of inflation with 
far-reaching consequences that are still hurting us.  More important, the 
Vietnam War gave birth to and nurtured the "new morality" and the hippy 
subculture.  It led millions of young persons to hate and despise their country. 
 In the long run, the dug-and-dropout culture spawned by the Vietnam War may 
prove more damaging to the United States than an atom bomb attack. </p>
<p align="left">     Moreover, the war discredited, discouraged, and demoralized 
our military in a way that no defeat on the battlefield ever could.  The 
ultimate casualty, however, may have been America's conscience and spirit. Our 
will to resist Communism may have been buried beneath the frustration of the 
Vietnam war, while our dedication to the cause of freedom is mesmerized by 
Kissinger's siren song of detente. </p>
<p align="left">     At least this is what Henry Kissinger and his masters in 
the Shadow Government hope has happened. If America has lost the will to resist, 
then our collapse -- and the triumph of Kissinger's New World Order -- are 
inevitable. </p>
<p align="left">     To hasten the day when "Athens" is so weak and "Sparta" so 
strong that resistance is impossible, Henry the K has given the Communists the 
green light everywhere in the world.  And their progress during the past eight 
years is nothing short of phenomenal.  Yet thanks to the cloak of silence that 
is maintained around Communist advances by the mass media, their gains have 
passed virtually unnoticed by the majority of Americans. </p>
<p align="left">     It is not enough that Henry Kissinger be retired as 
Secretary of State, and allowed to retreat to some Ivy League citadel of 
illogic. Daily he becomes more controversial. . . but for all of the wrong 
reasons.  Yes, he is arrogant.  He is deceptive.  He is an egomaniac.  He is all 
the things that his political critics say he is.  He will probably be gone by 
January 1977, as the Shadow Government offers up his departure to quiet the 
populace.  But the Insiders will move heaven and earth to perpetuate his 
policies. </p>
<p align="left">     Getting rid of Kissinger is important, yes.  But if he is 
replaced by just another Rockefeller front man, the gesture will be meaningless. 
 In order to survive, America must repudiate Kissinger's policies and restore 
its determination to remain free and independent.  This means shutting off the 
transfer of money and technology to our avowed enemies, re-establishing our 
defensive capabilities, and encouraging other nations in the non-Communist world 
to defend themselves. </p>
<p align="left">     Under the present game plan there is no reason fore the 
Communists {Zionists! - JP} to abandon their goals.  why should they, when they 
are winning? </p>
<p align="left">     But Communism, for all its successes (mostly sponsored by 
"our" government), is very fragile.  Its economy is not self-sufficient and its 
satellites are not loyal.  If we stopped rescuing Communism from its failures 
and propping up its slave system, the Soviet Union would have to practice 
genuine peaceful coexistence.  It would have to stop its efforts to conquer 
others, and turn inward to solve its own problems or face some nasty revolts.
</p>
<p align="left">     The road to true peace with freedom does not lie in 
disarmament and detente, but in strength and resolve. </p>
<p align="left">     The United States stayed on that road during the 
Seventeenth and Eighteenth centuries, and our policies made us the hope and envy 
of the world.  It is not too late to switch paths; it is not too late to tell 
Henry Kissinger and his masters and mentors in the Shadow Government that we 
want no part of their New World Order. </p>
<p align="left">     But we must start now.  And the order to change directions 
must come from <i>you.</i> </p>
