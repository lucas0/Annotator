<b><u>
</u></b><p align="JUSTIFY"><b><u><font size="4">History of<i> The Marines' Hymn</i></font></u></b><font size="4">:
          (exerpt from <b><i><a href="http://www.usmcpress.com/../warriorculture.htm">Warrior Culture of
          the U.S. Marines</a></i></b>, Copyright 2001 Marion F. Sturkey)  The
          U.S. Army, the U.S. Navy, and the U.S. Air Force all have their own
          songs.<br/>
           <br/>
               For the <u>U.S. Navy</u>, <i><b>Anchors Aweigh</b></i>
          was written in 1906 by Lt. Charles Zimmerman and midshipman Alfred
          Miles. Initially the song was a tribute to the Naval Academy Class of
          1907. Various people revised it later, trying to weed out the
          nonsense. Another midshipman, Royal Lovell, penned the final stanza in
          1926. <i><b>Anchors Aweigh</b></i> has a snappy little tune, but no one knows
          what the words imply. The original first stanza in 1906 had dealt
          solely with the game of football. Even today, the song offers a
          bittersweet "farewell to college joys." The lyrics end by
          "wishing you a happy voyage home." Many musical experts
          think that <i><b>Anchors Aweigh</b></i> is a ballad for football players who
          like sailboats. But, no one really knows for sure.<br/>
               The <u>U.S. Army</u> adopted a snazzy tune
          for <i><b>The Caisson Song</b></i>. Unlike the words in the Navy's song, the
          words of the Army's song make sense. According to the words of each
          stanza, <i><b>The Caisson Song</b></i> clearly is a melody for rural
          motorists. Edmund Gruber wrote the original lyrics in the Philippines
          during World War I. Naturally, since most of the fighting was 8000
          miles away in Europe, Gruber made only a passing reference to warfare.
          Yet, he was careful to be "politically correct." He
          apparently sought the help of first grade students in composing the
          lyrics. The banal "Hi, hi, hee" is a dead giveaway. No one
          has a clue as to what it might mean. Still, at least it rhymes.<br/>
               The <u>U.S. Air Force</u> did not exist in
          1938. But, that year <i><b>Liberty Magazine</b></i> sponsored a contest for
          an official song for the Army Air Corps. The magazine received 757
          entries. A group of Army Air Corps wives (yes, believe it or not, <i><b>wives</b></i>)
          selected the entry from Robert Crawford, <i><b>Off We Go into the Wild
          Blue Yonder</b></i>.<br/>
               After World War II the Army Air Corps evolved
          into the U.S. Air Force. This fledgling flying club adopted <i><b>Off We
          Go'</b></i> as their official song. It suited the illusionary nature of
          the new Wild-Blue-Yonder-Wonders with references to "those who
          love the vastness of the sky" and the fictitious "rainbow's
          pot of gold." The final stanza speaks of the "gray haired
          wonder," an admirable gesture of non-discrimination for the new
          civilianized Air Force.<br/>
               These three songs, <b> <i>Anchors Aweigh</i>, <i>The
          Caisson Song</i></b>, and <i><b>Off We Go into the Wild Blue Yonder</b></i>, are
          often played at public events. They obviously delight the members and
          advocates of the affected service: Navy, Army, or Air Force. When
          their song is played, sailors, soldiers, and zoomies leap to their
          feet and shout, cheer, clap their hands, and jive with the music. They
          have a jolly time, almost like a high school pep rally.</font></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"><font size="4">     The U.S. Marine Corps is
          the United States' military band of brothers dedicated to warfighting.
          The proud Brotherhood of Marines is guided by principles, values,
          virtues, love of country, and its Warrior Culture. This brotherhood of
          American Patriots has no song. Instead, Marine Warriors have a <i><b>hymn</b></i>.
          When <i><b>The Marines' Hymn</b></i> is played, United States Marines stand
          at attention. They silently show their pride in their fellow Marines,
          their Corps, their Country, their heritage, and their hymn.<i><br/>
</i>     <i><b>The Marines' Hymn</b></i> is a tribute to
          Warriors. Marine Warriors stormed fortress Derna, raised the American
          flag, and gave us "the shores of Tripoli." Marines fought
          their way into the castle at Chapultepec and gave us the "halls
          of Montezuma." Marines exist for the purpose of warfighting.
          Fighting is their role in life. They "fight for right and
          freedom" and "to keep our honor clean." They fight
          "in the air, on land, and sea." The Marine Corps is Valhalla
          for Warriors. U.S. Marines need no <i>song</i>. They have a <i><b>hymn</b></i>.<br/>
               Ironically, no one knows who wrote the hymn,
          which was in widespread use by the mid-1800s. Col. A.S. McLemore,
          USMC, spent several years trying to identify the origin of the tune.
          In 1878 he told the leader of the Marine Band that the tune had been
          adopted from the comic opera <i>Genevieve de Barbant</i>, by Jaques
          Offenback. Yet, others believe the tune originated from a Spanish folk
          song. Whatever! Regardless of its origin, <i><b>The Marines' Hymn</b></i> has
          remained a revered icon of the United States Marine Corps for almost
          200 years.<br/>
               In 1929 <i><b>The Marines' Hymn</b> </i>became the <i><b>official</b>
</i>hymn of the Corps. Thirteen years later in November 1942 the
          Commandant approved a change in the words of the first verse, fourth
          line. Because of the increasing use of aircraft in the Corps, the
          words were changed to "In the air, on land, and sea." No
          other changes have been made since that time. When you have attained
          absolute perfection, there is no need for further modification:</font></p>
