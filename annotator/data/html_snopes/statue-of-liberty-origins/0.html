<font size="+3">Jim Haskins</font>
<p><font size="+2">From my viewpoint...</font>
</p><p><font size="+2">Misinformation has been disseminated via the Internet,
print articles, and other sources as to my role in the controversy over
whether the Statue of Liberty was originally a black woman. I have written
one, 48-page book for children on the statue: <i>The Statue of Liberty:
America's Proud Lady</i> (Minneapolis, MN: Lerner Publishing Co., 1986).
I have never written a book entitled <i>The Journey of the Songhai People</i>.
I have also never stated that the statue was presented by the people of
France to the people of the United States to honor the role of black soldiers
in the Civil War.</font>
</p><p><font size="+2">In <i>The Statue of Liberty: America's Proud Lady</i>,
I state that the impetus for the creation of the statue--and its presentation
to the United States of America by the people of France--was the abolition
of slavery in the United States. I further state that Frederic Auguste
Bartholdi, the sculptor of the statue, used his mother as the model for
the face, and that for the body he used as a model Emilie Baheux de Puysieux,
a young woman who later became his wife. I state also that in the course
of creating the statue, Bartholdi made changes in composition. At first,
he had a torch in her left hand; later, he changed it to her right. At
first, she was a very defiant figure; later, he made her more remote from
the affairs of men. At first, she held a broken chain in her other hand,
to symbolize the broken chains of bondage; later, Bartholdi decided she
should hold a tablet, inscribed with the date of the Declaration of Independence,
and that a fragment of chain would be on the ground, as if she had already
thrown it there.</font>
</p><p><font size="+2">The Museum of the City of New York owns two early clay
models of the statue. A photograph of the two models appears on page 20
of my book. Because the false information being disseminated states that
these models prove that the original statue was black, the Museum has been
inundated with inquiries for the past dozen years. The Museum has taken
the following steps: The models are on permanent display in the Museum's
Marine Gallery. They are also illustrated on the Museum's Web site--<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/19991005210247/http://www.mcny.org/">http://www.mcny.org</a>.
A special telephone extension for those who call states that the volume
of inquiries has been enormous, and those who inquire are asked either
to visit the Museum or its Web site to view the models.</font>
