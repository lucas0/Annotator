Recent legislation was sent to the president for his signature, H.R.218. This was a law enforcement act giving sworn police officers the right to carry concealed weapons across state lines without restrictions imposed by individual states. Was it in fact signed into law by the president? Thank You

Yes, H.R. 218, the Law Enforcement Officers Safety Act of 2004 was signed into public law (PL 108-277) on July 22, 2004. This law allows retired and off-duty law enforcement officers to carry concealed firearms in the hope that they may be better able to respond to crime and help protect innocent lives.

Presidents can still work after leaving office, and more than a few have. For instance, Former President Gerald Ford has served on corporate and charitable boards since the end of his Presidency, and former President Jimmy Carter has embarked on a second career as a humanitarian and leader with groups like Habitat for Humanity. Since the ratification of the 22nd Amendment in 1951, no person may "be elected to the office of the President more than twice." But former Presidents can still run for or serve in other public offices, and a number of them have. To cite just a few examples, former President John Quincy Adams had a distinguished post-presidency tenure in the U.S. Congress, and former President William Taft served as Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court.

<font size="2"><b>Kathleen from Ventura, California:</b><br/>

I got into a debate with a friend after reading the book 'Deception Point' by Dan Brown. Is there any truth to the section about switching the carpet in the Oval Office when the country is at war or peace? Specifically, the American Eagle's talons facing left toward the olive branch in peace and right toward the arrows at times of war. I personally think it's fiction but my friend is insistent that it is a fact. Thank you

There is just one Seal of the President at any given time, and it does not change according to whether or not the United States is at war. However, the Seal has undergone modifications over the years. President Truman modified the Seal in 1945, and the changes included turning the eagle's head to face its right as opposed to its left. </font></p><p><font size="2">
 A press release issued after the new design was approved said, "In the new Coat of Arms, Seal and Flag, the Eagle not only faces to its right--the direction of honor--but also toward the olive branches of peace which it holds in its right talon. Formerly the eagle faced toward the arrows in its left talon--arrows, symbolic of war." </font></p><p><font size="2">
 Although the eagle featured in the Presidential Seal has faced its right ever since, there are items in the White House collection that were made before 1945 that display the eagle facing its left (such as state services, furnishings, architectural elements, etc.)

In all cases, a Deputy Secretary is the number-two person at a Cabinet-level agency after the Secretary, so in the Secretary's absence, the Deputy Secretary is in command. Typically, a Deputy Secretary is in charge of the operational side of a department or agency. </font></p><p><font size="2">
 In some cases, Cabinet agencies are so large and programmatically complex that they utilize an Under Secretary to oversee groups of Assistant Secretaries. For example, the State Department, Department of Homeland Security, and Department of Defense all utilize several Under Secretaries. </font></p><p><font size="2">
 Most Assistant Secretary positions within a Cabinet agency oversee functions such as public affairs, legislative affairs, policy, and the like, while others are in charge of an program division like Community Planning and Development (Dept. of Housing and Urban Development) or Land and Minerals Management (Dept. of the Interior). </font></p><p><font size="2">
 Cabinet Secretaries, Deputy Secretaries, and Under Secretaries all require Senate confirmation as do most Assistant Secretary positions. Thank you for your question.

You did the smart thing by being cautious about any site that 'guarantees' grants or loans for a fee. The U.S. Small Business Administration can help you get started on the path toward capitalizing your new venture. The first step you might want to take is to visit our Web site at http://www.sba.gov. There you can learn about various SBA loan programs - like 7(a) and the 504 program - and how they might apply to you and your new business. Next, you should contact your local SBA office (there is at least one in every state) and speak directly with a specialist there who can better explain how to best go about getting your business capitalized. They might direct you to one of our partners, like SBDC or SCORE, who specialize in offering free, professional counseling to entrepreneurs. Those experts may in fact tell you that you don't need an SBA loan, and that some other source of capital would be a better fit for you. Or they may tell you that the SBA is the place for you. Either way, they can help you prepare to apply for that loan or grant, and get your business off the ground. I hope this answer is helpful, and good luck with your new business!

 There's certainly been some positive signs in terms of the Iraqi security forces addressing these ongoing security threats.

And we're going to be there to work with them along the way and partner with them to address these security threats.

As President Bush said, "With the landmark Clean Air Act of 1970, our nation set high goals for air quality. And this administration strongly supports those goals. I believe that by combining the ethic of good stewardship and the spirit of innovation, we will continue to improve the quality of our air and the health of our economy and improve the chance for people to have a good life here in America". </font></p><p><font size="2">
</font></p><p><font size="2">
Clear Skies legislation and the related Interstate Air Quality Rule are great examples in that they accomplish just what you and millions of Americans are asking for - sustained economic growth (new jobs) while being, to use your words, "proactive in protecting the environment". Clear Skies will cut pollution that causes smog, soot and acid rain by approximately 70 percent. This is an historic proposal that will bring cleaner air to Americans faster, more reliably, and more cost-effectively than what's being achieved under current law. The emissions trading program created by Clear Skies will create an economic incentive to reduce emissions early. It replaces a cycle of endless litigation with rapid and certain improvements in air quality. Every major coal-fired power plant will be in the program and the power sector will spend nearly $50 billion to come into compliance with our clean air policies that help States comply with the new national health-based air quality standards.

With respect to "initiating bold energy policies". President Bush introduced his Hydrogen Fuel Initiative in 2003 that will make it possible for the first car driven by a child born today to be powered by pollution-free fuel cells. Coupled with the FreedomCAR partnership, it is providing $1.7 billion over five years to develop hydrogen-powered fuel cells, a hydrogen infrastructure, and advanced automobile technologies that emit no greenhouse gases and will help reduce the country.s dependence on foreign oil.

The United States is also sponsoring, with international and private-sector partners, a $1 billion, 10-year demonstration project to create the world's first coal-based, zero-emissions electricity and hydrogen power plant (FutureGen). This project is designed to dramatically reduce air pollution and capture and store greenhouse gases.

We are also making significant strides in cutting pollution from diesel engines and reducing the sulfur content in diesel fuel. In May, we finalized a rule that will dramatically reduce pollution from heavy-duty diesel engines used in construction, agricultural, and industrial equipment. Soot and NOx emissions will decrease by more than 90 percent by 2014, and the sulfur content of diesel fuel will be cut 99 percent by 2010.

The President is also calling for $4.1 billion in tax incentives through 2009 to spur the use of clean, renewable energy, and energy-efficient technologies, such as hybrid and fuel-cell vehicles, residential solar heating systems, renewable energy produced from landfill gas, wind, or biomass, and efficient combined heat and power systems.

President Franklin D. Roosevelet and King George VI of England processed from Union Station to the White House during the roayl couples' state visit in 1939. That parade was one of many events stated in honor of King George and Princess Elizabeth, and was an exception rather than the rule for all formal visits. The state arrival ceremony as we think of it today was begun during the Kennedy administration, when President Kennedy changed the location of the formal welcome ceremony from Andrews Air Force Base to the South Lawn of the White House.
