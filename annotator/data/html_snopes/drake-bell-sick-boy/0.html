Here\u2019s why Trump turned a former hot tub salesman with little experience into the nation\u2019s top law enforcement official.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nMichael G. Whitaker was born in 1969 in Ankeny, Iowa, a suburb of Des Moines. In 1995, he received his Juris Doctor degree and a master\u2019s degree in finance from the university\u2019s school of business.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nUpon graduation, Whitaker went into practice as a lawyer for a handful of regional law firms. He was also corporate counsel for a national grocery company. In 2002, with experience in arguing for grocery stores, he decided to take his talents to public office. As a Republican, Whitaker ran unsuccessfully for state treasurer of Iowa, losing the race to the incumbent Democrat. By 2004, Whitaker finally locked down a position in politics It was a position that didn\u2019t have to be voted on - so he won! He was appointed the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Iowa where he served for 5 years, until the Obama administration took over.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nWhitaker then thought he\u2019d try his hand at running for the highest chamber of Congress. He ran as a Republican in Iowa for the United States Senate. But Whitaker\u2019s arguably most troubling idea came when he said he would only support federal judges who have a biblical worldview. In a 2014 debate, Whitaker went pretty hard at the idea of a secular judge - even though the office of a U.S. Senator is secular. \"If they have a secular worldview, then I'm going to be very concerned about how they judge,\" he said.<br \/>\r\nThe Des Moines Register notes that what he was effectively saying was, \u201cif elected, he would see no place for a judge of Jewish, Hindu, Muslim, Buddhist, agnostic or other faith, or of no faith.\u201d &nbsp;<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nAfter news broke that Donald Jr. had met with a Russian lawyer who was offering dirt on Hillary Clinton, Whitaker came to bat for the president\u2019s adult son. Continuing his quest to become a blip on Trump\u2019s radar, Whitaker retweeted a Philadelphia Inquirer article titled, \u201cNote to Trump\u2019s Lawyer: Do Not Cooperate With Mueller Lynch Mob.\u201d All of this was seemingly music to Trump\u2019s ears as\u2014just a month after Whitaker\u2019s hit piece on Mueller\u2019s probe dropped\u2014Attorney General Jeff Sessions hired him as his chief of staff.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nOn November 7, 2018, Trump forced Sessions to resign. The latest move in his slow-motion Saturday night massacre. The president\u2019s reason for bypassing Rod Rosenstein, the guy who\u2019s actually senate confirmed, for Matthew Whitaker is pretty clear by now.<\/p>\r\n","link":"videos\/politics\/who-is-matthew-whitaker","title_sort_si":"Who Is Matthew Whitaker?","body_clean":"<p>Matthew Whitaker is the acting Attorney General who reportedly has no intention of recusing himself from the Mueller probe he repeatedly criticized.

It could allow health care providers to refuse working with patients, trans Americans could be denied jobs, housing and schools could feel even more empowered to discriminate against trans children.\r\n","company":["NowThis"],"is_closed":false,"is_event":false,"is_allied":false,"is_sponsored":false,"url":["videos\/politics\/who-is-roger-severino-narrated-by-pat-regan","videos\/who-is-roger-severino-narrated-by-pat-regan"],"uid_ii":582,"id":"node-5022798","new_taxonomy":{"company":[{"name":"NowThis","parent_tid":"0","tid":135815,"meta":{"default_image":"2700833","display_name":"","vortex_company_id":"0","zuul_company_id":"0","pinnacle_preview_base_url":"https:\/\/admin-preview.nowthisnews.com","pinnacle_base_url":"https:\/\/www.nowthisnews.com"}},{"name":"NowThis","parent_tid":"0","tid":135815,"meta":{"default_image":"2700833","display_name":"","vortex_company_id":"0","zuul_company_id":"0","pinnacle_preview_base_url":"https:\/\/admin-preview.nowthisnews.com","pinnacle_base_url":"https:\/\/www.nowthisnews.com"}},{"name":"NowThis News","parent_tid":"135815","tid":4818022,"meta":{"default_image":"2827662","display_name":"","vortex_company_id":"0","zuul_company_id":"0","pinnacle_preview_base_url":"https:\/\/admin-preview.nowthisnews.com","pinnacle_base_url":"https:\/\/nowthisnews.com"}}],"tags":[{"name":"Roger Severino","parent_tid":"0","tid":4814443},{"name":"catholic","parent_tid":"0","tid":144188},{"name":"Trump","parent_tid":"0","tid":136722},{"name":"transgender","parent_tid":"0","tid":137410}],"platform compatibility":[{"name":"Apple News","parent_tid":"0","tid":135896},{"name":"Facebook Instant","parent_tid":"0","tid":33821},{"name":"Google AMP","parent_tid":"0","tid":33822},{"name":"Search Engines","parent_tid":"0","tid":33953}],"vertical":[{"name":"Politics","parent_tid":"0","tid":135919,"meta":{"is_primary":"true","seo_description":"","seo_title":"","sponsor":""}}],"reporting category":[{"name":"Editorial","parent_tid":"0","tid":33734}],"topic":[{"name":"Must Watch","parent_tid":"0","tid":4652581,"meta":{"default_topic_header":"2727934","flags":"","name":"","seo_description":"All the most incredible must-watch videos you can see right now from NowThis","seo_title":"Must Watch: Daily Video News - NowThis","social_description":"","social_title":"","sponsor":"","subtitle":"Seeing is definitely believing.

He\u2019s known Trump for forty years and is the proud owner of a giant back tattoo of Richard Nixon, a frequent pusher of conspiracy theories, and self-described \u201cdirty trickster\u201d.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nRoger Stone was born in 1952 in Norwalk, Connecticut to parents he reportedly described as middle-class, blue-collar Catholics. By the time he was twelve, Stone switched from staunch Democrat to hardcore conservative when a neighbor gave him Barry Goldwater\u2019s book, \u201cThe Conscience of A Conservative\u201d. From there on out, Stone was an ardent supporter of conservatives in many forms.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nAfter high school, Stone attended George Washington University in D.C., but he never graduated. He instead took a job working for the committee to get Nixon re-elected. The young Republican was just 19 when his \u201cdirty tricks\u201d made it to the national stage and caught the eye of the Senate Watergate Committee. Stone used the pseudonym Jason Rainier and donated money to Nixon\u2019s rival on behalf of the Young Socialist Alliance. He then slipped the receipt to the New Hampshire press to show that Nixon\u2019s opponent was a puppet owned by the left. As Politico notes, \u201cStone\u2019s most successful role as a Watergate trickster was a part he played running a 1972 CREEP operation called \u201cSedan Chair II,\u201dwhere he hired a Republican spy to infiltrate the McGovern campaign. After Nixon won and then resigned in the wake of Watergate, Stone believed that the man, who would later adorn his back, was completely innocent.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nAfter a short stint with Bob Dole, Stone stopped working directly with candidates and co-founded the National Conservative Political Action Committee in 1975. NCPAC was one of the first successful PACs. It raised funds and ran aggressive negative campaign ads to oust prominent Democrats from Congress.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nIn 1980, Stone signed on as Northeast coordinator for Reagan\u2019s second bid at the White House where he met Roy Cohn, the infamous Gotham mafia lawyer, who would introduce him to the man he\u2019d soon shape into a prominent political figure: Donald J. Trump. Trump gave Stone $200,000 in checks made out to \"Reagan for President.\"<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nAfter Reagan won The White House, Stone started one of Washington\u2019s first major lobbying firms with his old campaign manager, Paul Manafort, and Reagan campaign alumnus, Charles Black. Aside from catering to controversial dictators, the firm also represented Stone\u2019s new friend: Donald J. Trump.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nIn 1987, Stone urged his buddy to run for president. He organized campaign-like events in New Hampshire, where Trump made a speech about how the country was being kicked around and laughed at. Unfortunately for Stone, Trump didn\u2019t end up running and was allegedly using the platform as a way to publicize his upcoming book: \u201cThe Art of the Deal.\u201d<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nIn 1996, Stone\u2019s career took a turn. He was forced to leave as a senior consultant on Senator Bob Dole\u2019s presidential campaign after The National Enquirer revealed that Stone and his second wife posted ads and pictures looking for sex partners in a magazine called Local Swing Fever. Stone\u2019s image was seemingly tarnished after his swinger ads came to light. He was ousted from the spotlight and continued the rest of his career lurking behind the scenes.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nStone worked on the Trump campaign as an advisor for about two months before he was either fired or quit, depending on who you believe. But it\u2019s the time Stone spent in the shadows that was crucial in getting the Donald to The White House.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nIn August of 2016, a few months before the election, Stone sent out a mysterious tweet about John Podesta, Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman. \u201cTrust me, it will soon [be] Podesta\u2019s time in the barrel.\u201d A few months later, in October, Stone again tweeted: \u201cWednesday, Hillary Clinton is done. #Wikileaks.\u201d Just a few days later, Wikileaks dropped thousands of private emails belonging to John Podesta.<br \/>\r\nIn January of 2019, Roger Stone\u2019s dirty tricks had finally caught up to him. Stone was arrested and indicted on seven criminal charges as part of Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nStone was charged with obstruction, making false statements, and witness tampering. Stone told the witness to \u201cdo a Frank Pentangeli\u201d. Which is a reference to a character in \u201cThe Godfather: Part ll\u201d who lies before congress. Mueller\u2019s indictment shows a link between Wikileaks\u2019 efforts to damage Hillary Clinton and the Trump campaign\u2019s efforts to do the same. That link is clearly Roger Stone.<\/p>\r\n","link":"videos\/politics\/who-is-roger-stone-narrated-by-kathy-griffin","title_sort_si":"Who Is Roger Stone?

A 2007 investigation by the U.S. State Department found that Blackwater was overbilling the State Department by manipulating its personnel records.

While he raps about being \u201cstraight out the trailer,\u201d Ritchie actually grew up in the upper-middle class. His formative years were spent in a home with a swimming pool, tennis court, and an apple orchard. He moved to Detroit as a teen to pursue his love of rap. He performed as a DJ around the motor city where he got his stage name. People wanted to come out and see \u201cthat white kid rock\u201d.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nRock\u2019s first album, \u201cGrits Sandwiches for Breakfast,\u201d came out in 1990. The album, clearly inspired by<br \/>\r\nRun DMC, showcased Rock\u2019s early rapping chops and featured a special shoutout.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nto his future golf buddy. \u201cNow people always ask me and KDC If we take this activity seriously. I reply,<br \/>\r\nwith a sigh rather uniquely and say does Donald Trump have a lotta money?\u201d &nbsp;The album was a total flop and Rock decided to lose his flat top and pivot genres.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nAfter bouncing around record labels, Rock shed his rap roots after experiencing a life altering epiphany: \u201cI realized that...I couldn\u2019t, basically, be black,\u201d he said. After arriving at this stunning realization, Rock switched from hip-hop to southern rock, metal, blues, and everything in between. He signed with Atlantic Records, where he released the album that put him on the map: 1998\u2019s \u201cDevil Without a Cause.\u201d After its release, Ritchie successfully worked his way up the Detroit music ladder, and soon became a multi-platinum--roll icon. He was living large, doing a ton of drugs, physically assaulting people, displaying the confederate flag at his concerts, marrying Pamela Anderson, and even appearing in a sex tape.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nIn 2012, Rock supported Mitt Romney because he considered him to be super lame. \u201cActually, Romney strikes me as super fuckin\u2019 honest. He\u2019s a complete nerd,though...that\u2019s kind of what I want going on in there.\u201d<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nFollowing the Charleston church massacre by a white supremacist, protesters urged Rock to denounce the Confederate Flag he often used as a backdrop for concerts.

His father, Jerry Falwell Sr., ostensibly instilled his wild ideas on his impressionable son from a young age. Falwell Sr. was a televangelist turned political activist, who warned that one of the Teletubbies was gay and blamed 9\/11 on feminism and the LGBTQ+ community.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nJerry Sr. was an early architect of the religious right. He opened Liberty University in 1971, a hub for like-minded evangelical Christian students to engage in one-sided debates regarding Creationism and the dangers of homosexuality. To keep his university on the bigoted white path he deemed appropriate, Falwell Sr. created the Moral Majority, a political organization birthed in response to pesky human rights, like equality. He believed integrating Christian schools, like his, would undermine the country\u2019s traditional history of racism and everything that makes America super great. The organization shuttered in the late 80s, but not before helping usher in Reagan\u2019s presidency and laying the groundwork for a new political bloc of the religious right.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nWhen Falwell Sr. passed away in \u201807, Jerry Jr. took over Liberty University, and expanded on his father\u2019s Christian masterpiece. Falwell Jr. would soon become the leading, mumbling and meandering voice of the new religious right.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nUnder Falwell Jr., Liberty developed rapidly. The school moved into Division I sports, the highest level of the NCAA. By 2016, it had roughly 14,000 students enrolled on its campus and 113,000 students taking online courses. Which is a ton of people taking Evangelism 101, a graduation requirement. The class syllabus says the course is \u201can in-depth study of how to lead people to Christ.\u201d Politico notes, \u201cIn order to pass the course, students are required to write a \u201cwitness report,\u201d a two-page paper that documents a \u201cface-to-face encounter\u201d they have with one \u201cunbeliever\u201d to whom they evangelize.\u201d<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nFalwell Jr. was the first prominent evangelical supporter of Trump. Early on he said, \u201cIn my opinion, Donald Trump lives a life of loving and helping others as Jesus taught in the great commandment.\u201d And in January of 2016, he formally endorsed Trump for president.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nBuzzfeed notes, \u201cIn January 2016, when Trump\u2019s candidacy was still considered a long shot and he had almost no brand-name evangelical support, Falwell Jr.\u2019s endorsement \u201cmarked a turning point for the entire religious right,\u201d said Randall Balmer, a Dartmouth professor who studies the evangelical movement.\u201d<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nOne prominent member of the university, Mark DeMoss, a graduate of Liberty, and a member of the school\u2019s board of trustees, seemingly felt the pressure to resign after having a different opinion than Falwell Jr. After Falwell Jr. endorsed Trump, DeMoss was quoted in the Washington Post, \u201cDonald Trump is the only candidate who has dealt almost exclusively in the politics of personal insult...It\u2019s not Christ-like behavior that Liberty has spent 40 years promoting with its students.\u201d This didn\u2019t sit well with Falwell Jr., who thought his motives were entirely political. DeMoss resigned from the school after indicating a \u201cconcern about a lack of trust.\u201d<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nWhile others at the school seemingly can\u2019t speak on any important issues regarding politics, Falwell Jr. has only been expanding on his admiration for Trump. He\u2019s stood by the former steak salesman through thick and thin. When Trump said there were \u201cvery fine people on both sides\u201d of the white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Falwell Jr. agreed.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nBy the looks of it, Falwell Jr., who \u201ccan\u2019t imagine Trump doing anything bad for the country\u201d will once again be leading the religious right to help secure another term for the only guy who loves fast food even more than he does.<\/p>\r\n","link":"videos\/politics\/who-is-jerry-falwell-jr-narrated-by-louis-virtel","title_sort_si":"Who Is Jerry Falwell Jr.?

In 1996, she won the Senate seat left open by her former boss, Bill Cohen, where she\u2019d be for the next few decades.\r\n\r\nIn the Senate, Collins has championed the moderate label. \u201cI\u2019m consistently sought out by both sides for co-sponsorship of bills, I have a lot of power -- I like that.\u201d She has voted against efforts to define marriage as between a man and a woman , and from 1997 to 2016, she voted with her party on party-line votes only 59% of the time- when the average senator during that time voted with their party roughly 90% of the time. But ever since a former steak salesman narrowly won the Presidency, Collins has - for the most part - been in lockstep with the steak man.\r\n\r\nIn 2017, Collins sided with Republicans in 87% of party-line votes, the highest percentage in her time in the Senate. She voted for the passage of a massive tax cut for the richest families and biggest corporations. She voted to confirm Neil Gorsuch. She was one of the earliest supporters of Jeff Sessions bid to become Attorney General, a guy who said he thought the KKK were \u2018ok\u2019 until he found out they smoked pot. She voted against Betsy DeVos perhaps knowing Pence would break the tie in the Senate while allowing Collins to maintain her moderate label, who knows. And then there was super beer fan and accused sexual assaulter Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. At first, Collins appeared undecided. But after Collins heard Kavanaugh scream at Amy Klobuchar about beer, she believed there was no way Kavanaugh did this.\r\n\r\nCollins is up for reelection in 2020, and it won\u2019t be an easy race considering she has received more donations from Texas fossil fuel industries than by human people in her state of Maine. In the first quarter of 2019, only thirteen Maine residents gave Collins $200 or more. If Collins, a \u2018moderate\u2019 Republican, wasn\u2019t already vulnerable enough, her opponent \u2014 who doesn\u2019t yet exist \u2014 has more than 3 million dollars waiting for them, thanks to donations raised by not fossil fuel industries, but actual people. It\u2019s unclear if Collins will put on one last face and reach across the aisle to grab money that isn\u2019t hers.\r\n","company":["NowThis"],"is_closed":false,"is_event":false,"is_allied":false,"is_sponsored":false,"url":["videos\/politics\/who-is-susan-collins-narrated-by-cheslie-kryst","videos\/who-is-susan-collins-narrated-by-cheslie-kryst"],"uid_ii":582,"id":"node-5029974","new_taxonomy":{"company":[{"name":"NowThis","parent_tid":"0","tid":135815,"meta":{"default_image":"2700833","display_name":"","vortex_company_id":"0","zuul_company_id":"0","pinnacle_preview_base_url":"https:\/\/admin-preview.nowthisnews.com","pinnacle_base_url":"https:\/\/www.nowthisnews.com"}},{"name":"NowThis","parent_tid":"0","tid":135815,"meta":{"default_image":"2700833","display_name":"","vortex_company_id":"0","zuul_company_id":"0","pinnacle_preview_base_url":"https:\/\/admin-preview.nowthisnews.com","pinnacle_base_url":"https:\/\/www.nowthisnews.com"}},{"name":"NowThis News","parent_tid":"135815","tid":4818022,"meta":{"default_image":"2827662","display_name":"","vortex_company_id":"0","zuul_company_id":"0","pinnacle_preview_base_url":"https:\/\/admin-preview.nowthisnews.com","pinnacle_base_url":"https:\/\/nowthisnews.com"}}],"tags":[{"name":"Susan Collins","parent_tid":"0","tid":4811393},{"name":"moderate","parent_tid":"0","tid":4816727},{"name":"Cheslie Kryst","parent_tid":"0","tid":4817628},{"name":"Brett Kavanaugh","parent_tid":"0","tid":4810533}],"platform compatibility":[{"name":"Apple News","parent_tid":"0","tid":135896},{"name":"Facebook Instant","parent_tid":"0","tid":33821},{"name":"Google AMP","parent_tid":"0","tid":33822},{"name":"Search Engines","parent_tid":"0","tid":33953}],"vertical":[{"name":"Politics","parent_tid":"0","tid":135919,"meta":{"is_primary":"true","seo_description":"","seo_title":"","sponsor":""}}],"reporting category":[{"name":"Editorial","parent_tid":"0","tid":33734}]},"term":["NowThis","Susan Collins","moderate","Cheslie Kryst","Brett Kavanaugh","Apple News","Facebook Instant","Google AMP","Search Engines","Politics","Editorial","NowThis News"],"tid":[135815,4811393,4816727,4817628,4810533,135896,33821,33822,33953,135919,33734,4818022],"taxonomy":{"company_tim":["NowThis","NowThis News"],"tags_tim":["Susan Collins","moderate","Cheslie Kryst","Brett Kavanaugh"],"platform-compatibility_tim":["Apple News","Facebook Instant","Google AMP","Search Engines"],"vertical_tim":["Politics"],"reporting-category_tim":["Editorial"]},"platform_sim":["Apple News","Facebook Instant","Google AMP","Search Engines"],"vertical_sim":["Politics"],"byline":"","byline_norm":"","data_s":"[]","primary_vertical":{"tid":135919,"name":"Politics"},"published":"2019-05-22T21:26:14Z","published_date_string":"2019-05-22T21:26:14Z","published_date":1558578374,"published_date_rss":"Wed, 22 May 2019 21:26:14 -0500","sort_date_dti":"2019-05-22T21:26:14Z","seo_description":"Susan Collins is the moderate Republican whose \"swing vote\" proved decisive in confirming Justice Brett Kavanaugh.

He graduated in 1977 and left the agency for a clerkship with a judge on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. In the early eighties, Barr served on the domestic policy staff in the Reagan administration before being tapped by George H.W. Bush to Assistant Attorney General for the Department of Justice Office of Legal Counsel. It was in this post that Barr exercised his \u201csummarize-and-redact-muscle,\u201d the same muscle he\u2019d go on to use for \u201cHome Alone 2\u201d cameo star, Donald J. Trump.<br \/>\r\n&nbsp;<br \/>\r\nUnder George H.W. Bush, Barr wrote and tried to hide a very controversial legal opinion, seemingly suggesting that the U.S. could unilaterally\u2014without the go ahead from international governments\u2014send its FBI agents to overthrow a foreign leader from power. Barr was asked to hand over the legal memo containing the rationale for allowing something like this. He declined and instead offered a 13-page document that summarized \u201cthe principal conclusions.\u201d But when Congress eventually obtained the full memo in 1991, it was discovered that his summary left out some of the conclusions in the full memo, which is bad. Ryan Goodman, a former Defense Department special counsel, wrote that Barr\u2019s summary \u201domitted some of the most consequential and incendiary conclusions from the actual opinion. And there was evidently no justifiable reason for having withheld those parts from Congress or the public.\u201d<br \/>\r\n&nbsp;<br \/>\r\nThe Reagan and Bush administrations were also accused of funneling billions of dollars in loans to Sadam Hussein, in what was termed \u201cIraq-Gate.\u201d Barr was accused of protecting the president by refusing a congressional request to appoint an independent counsel to investigate the matter. Reports at the time paint a harrowing image of Barr. The New York Times columnist William Safire called Barr \u201cthe Coverup-General.\u201d<br \/>\r\n&nbsp;<br \/>\r\nIn 2017, Barr wrote an op-ed in The Washington Post titled \u201cTrump Made The Right Call On Comey.\u201d Barr also reportedly believed that there was more reason to investigate Hillary Clinton than the guy he wanted a job from. In June 2018, as if Barr didn\u2019t already have the gig, he sent an unsolicited memo to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein In the memo, called \u201cMueller\u2019s \u2018Obstruction\u2019 Theory,\u201d Barr\u2014in 19 pages\u2014basically laid the groundwork for the argument that Mueller might be investigating a made up a crime.<br \/>\r\n&nbsp;<br \/>\r\nSpecial Counsel Robert Mueller handed his report over to Barr in March 2019 after a nearly 2-year investigation surrounding Russia\u2019s election interference and whether it colluded with Donald Trump. Eight Americans once affiliated with the Trump campaign or administration, 25 Russians, three Russian companies, and two others were charged in the investigation. Just two days after Mueller turned in his more than 400-page report, it was reduced to just four pages of Barr\u2019s famous \u201cprincipal conclusions.\u201d<br \/>\r\n&nbsp;<br \/>\r\nAfter Barr released his four-page summary of Mueller\u2019s findings, Mueller wrote him a letter, expressing concern that Barr had mischaracterized his report, because Barr was totally that kid in class who lied about reading the book. And Mueller went further when he spoke to the public for the first time after roughly two years of silence. Barr seemingly believed, because Mueller didn\u2019t charge Trump with obstruction, the president was exonerated. But really, under the Justice Department rules, you cannot indict a sitting president. It has to go to Congress.<br \/>\r\n&nbsp;<br \/>\r\nThe special counsel investigation reported 10 instances of possible obstruction of justice involving the president, including Trump\u2019s failed attempt to fire Mueller. And in so many words, Mueller hinted at the possibility of an impeachment inquiry by Congress stating, \u201cthe Constitution requires a process other than the criminal justice system to formally accuse a sitting president of wrongdoing.\u201d<br \/>\r\n&nbsp;<br \/>\r\nWhile Barr\u2019s days of protecting past, current, and possibly future presidents seem to be far from over, one thing\u2019s for certain: No one, not Barr, or the President of the United States is above the law. We think.","link":"videos\/politics\/who-is-william-barr-narrated-by-jamie-lee","title_sort_si":"\u2028Who Is William Barr?

thinks that it\u2019s time to end tackle football for kids once and for all.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>\u201cWhen NFL players describe the sport as living out a car crash, imagine what it does to kids who are still growing into their bodies.\u201d Rozwadowski stated. \u201cA new study from Boston University says that you don\u2019t even need a concussion to get CTE.\u201d<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>\u201cCTE stands for chronic traumatic encephalopathy. And this is the disorder that has been described in, primarily athletes&nbsp;who participate in contact sports.\u201d Dr. Daniel Perl, Pathology Professor at Uniformed Services University, stated.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>Blows to the head are enough to cause brain damage.

The fourth is fanning the flames, by \u201ctrolling\u201d to incite rage. \r\n\r\nIn order to decrease this toxic online system, Ryan believes that social media and tech companies should step up and help improve their communities so they are less toxic \u2014 and none of that can happen until they take responsibility for what\u2019s going wrong. \r\n","company":["NowThis"],"is_closed":false,"is_event":false,"is_allied":false,"is_sponsored":false,"url":["videos\/politics\/how-the-far-right-is-dividing-americans-with-social-media"],"uid_ii":582,"id":"node-5013213","new_taxonomy":{"company":[{"name":"NowThis","parent_tid":"0","tid":135815,"meta":{"default_image":"2700833","display_name":"","vortex_company_id":"0","zuul_company_id":"0","pinnacle_preview_base_url":"https:\/\/admin-preview.nowthisnews.com","pinnacle_base_url":"https:\/\/www.nowthisnews.com"}},{"name":"NowThis","parent_tid":"0","tid":135815,"meta":{"default_image":"2700833","display_name":"","vortex_company_id":"0","zuul_company_id":"0","pinnacle_preview_base_url":"https:\/\/admin-preview.nowthisnews.com","pinnacle_base_url":"https:\/\/www.nowthisnews.com"}},{"name":"NowThis News","parent_tid":"135815","tid":4818022,"meta":{"default_image":"2827662","display_name":"","vortex_company_id":"0","zuul_company_id":"0","pinnacle_preview_base_url":"https:\/\/admin-preview.nowthisnews.com","pinnacle_base_url":"https:\/\/nowthisnews.com"}}],"tags":[{"name":"social media","parent_tid":"0","tid":138214},{"name":"far-right","parent_tid":"0","tid":4809576},{"name":"america","parent_tid":"0","tid":137367},{"name":"internet","parent_tid":"0","tid":140093}],"platform compatibility":[{"name":"Apple News","parent_tid":"0","tid":135896},{"name":"Facebook Instant","parent_tid":"0","tid":33821},{"name":"Google AMP","parent_tid":"0","tid":33822},{"name":"Search Engines","parent_tid":"0","tid":33953}],"vertical":[{"name":"Politics","parent_tid":"0","tid":135919,"meta":{"is_primary":"true","seo_description":"","seo_title":"","sponsor":""}}],"reporting category":[{"name":"Editorial","parent_tid":"0","tid":33734}],"topic":[{"name":"Must Watch","parent_tid":"0","tid":4652581,"meta":{"default_topic_header":"2727934","flags":"","name":"","seo_description":"All the most incredible must-watch videos you can see right now from NowThis","seo_title":"Must Watch: Daily Video News - NowThis","social_description":"","social_title":"","sponsor":"","subtitle":"Seeing is definitely believing.

And if that still doesn\u2019t work, ask yourself what you\u2019re going to say at the end of your life when God asks you, \u2018How did you care for your brothers and sisters who were refugees and migrants?\u2019\u201d\r\n","company":["NowThis"],"is_closed":false,"is_event":false,"is_allied":false,"is_sponsored":false,"url":["videos\/politics\/reverend-jim-martin-discusses-welcoming-migrant-children","videos\/reverend-jim-martin-discusses-welcoming-migrant-children"],"uid_ii":582,"id":"node-5013963","new_taxonomy":{"company":[{"name":"NowThis","parent_tid":"0","tid":135815,"meta":{"default_image":"2700833","display_name":"","vortex_company_id":"0","zuul_company_id":"0","pinnacle_preview_base_url":"https:\/\/admin-preview.nowthisnews.com","pinnacle_base_url":"https:\/\/www.nowthisnews.com"}},{"name":"NowThis","parent_tid":"0","tid":135815,"meta":{"default_image":"2700833","display_name":"","vortex_company_id":"0","zuul_company_id":"0","pinnacle_preview_base_url":"https:\/\/admin-preview.nowthisnews.com","pinnacle_base_url":"https:\/\/www.nowthisnews.com"}},{"name":"NowThis News","parent_tid":"135815","tid":4818022,"meta":{"default_image":"2827662","display_name":"","vortex_company_id":"0","zuul_company_id":"0","pinnacle_preview_base_url":"https:\/\/admin-preview.nowthisnews.com","pinnacle_base_url":"https:\/\/nowthisnews.com"}}],"tags":[{"name":"immigration","parent_tid":"0","tid":138512},{"name":"kids","parent_tid":"0","tid":138070},{"name":"ice","parent_tid":"0","tid":137990},{"name":"bible","parent_tid":"0","tid":144420}],"platform compatibility":[{"name":"Apple News","parent_tid":"0","tid":135896},{"name":"Facebook Instant","parent_tid":"0","tid":33821},{"name":"Google AMP","parent_tid":"0","tid":33822},{"name":"Search Engines","parent_tid":"0","tid":33953}],"vertical":[{"name":"Politics","parent_tid":"0","tid":135919,"meta":{"is_primary":"true","seo_description":"","seo_title":"","sponsor":""}}],"reporting category":[{"name":"Editorial","parent_tid":"0","tid":33734}],"topic":[{"name":"Immigration","parent_tid":"0","tid":4652583,"meta":{"default_topic_header":"2728322","flags":"","name":"","seo_description":"The most important video news, interviews, opinion and reports on immigration, undocumented immigrants, and deportation issues in America today from NowThis","seo_title":"Immigration: Border Protection, Deportation & Immigation News & Videos - NowThis","social_description":"","social_title":"","sponsor":"","subtitle":"Behind every political immigration speech are real human lives and real families at stake.

And, instead of showing the world that that he and the U.S. can stand up to Russia\u2019s meddling, he basically displayed the exact opposite.\r\n","company":["NowThis"],"is_closed":false,"is_event":false,"is_allied":false,"is_sponsored":false,"url":["videos\/news\/why-trump-is-putins-useful-idiot-after-helsinki-summit"],"uid_ii":582,"id":"node-5015315","new_taxonomy":{"company":[{"name":"NowThis","parent_tid":"0","tid":135815,"meta":{"default_image":"2700833","display_name":"","vortex_company_id":"0","zuul_company_id":"0","pinnacle_preview_base_url":"https:\/\/admin-preview.nowthisnews.com","pinnacle_base_url":"https:\/\/www.nowthisnews.com"}},{"name":"NowThis","parent_tid":"0","tid":135815,"meta":{"default_image":"2700833","display_name":"","vortex_company_id":"0","zuul_company_id":"0","pinnacle_preview_base_url":"https:\/\/admin-preview.nowthisnews.com","pinnacle_base_url":"https:\/\/www.nowthisnews.com"}},{"name":"NowThis News","parent_tid":"135815","tid":4818022,"meta":{"default_image":"2827662","display_name":"","vortex_company_id":"0","zuul_company_id":"0","pinnacle_preview_base_url":"https:\/\/admin-preview.nowthisnews.com","pinnacle_base_url":"https:\/\/nowthisnews.com"}}],"tags":[{"name":"Russia","parent_tid":"0","tid":136747},{"name":"Trump","parent_tid":"0","tid":136722},{"name":"putin","parent_tid":"0","tid":138191},{"name":"summit","parent_tid":"0","tid":4809613}],"platform compatibility":[{"name":"Apple News","parent_tid":"0","tid":135896},{"name":"Facebook Instant","parent_tid":"0","tid":33821},{"name":"Google AMP","parent_tid":"0","tid":33822},{"name":"Search Engines","parent_tid":"0","tid":33953}],"vertical":[{"name":"News","parent_tid":"0","tid":136238,"meta":{"is_primary":"true","seo_description":"","seo_title":"","sponsor":""}}],"reporting category":[{"name":"Editorial","parent_tid":"0","tid":33734}],"topic":[{"name":"Must Watch","parent_tid":"0","tid":4652581,"meta":{"default_topic_header":"2727934","flags":"","name":"","seo_description":"All the most incredible must-watch videos you can see right now from NowThis","seo_title":"Must Watch: Daily Video News - NowThis","social_description":"","social_title":"","sponsor":"","subtitle":"Seeing is definitely believing.

And so if you find yourself in the loop and you can\u2019t turn away, and you\u2019re finding it difficult to leave the house, or to feel safe, or you\u2019re questioning strangers on the street \u2014 you don\u2019t even know who they are and you\u2019re feeling threatened by them \u2014 it\u2019s time to turn away and turn it off,\u201d she stated.\r\n","company":["NowThis"],"is_closed":false,"is_event":false,"is_allied":false,"is_sponsored":false,"url":["videos\/news\/mental-health-expert-on-the-impact-of-seeing-acts-of-racism-go-viral","videos\/mental-health-expert-on-the-impact-of-seeing-acts-of-racism-go-viral"],"uid_ii":582,"id":"node-5016573","new_taxonomy":{"company":[{"name":"NowThis","parent_tid":"0","tid":135815,"meta":{"default_image":"2700833","display_name":"","vortex_company_id":"0","zuul_company_id":"0","pinnacle_preview_base_url":"https:\/\/admin-preview.nowthisnews.com","pinnacle_base_url":"https:\/\/www.nowthisnews.com"}},{"name":"NowThis","parent_tid":"0","tid":135815,"meta":{"default_image":"2700833","display_name":"","vortex_company_id":"0","zuul_company_id":"0","pinnacle_preview_base_url":"https:\/\/admin-preview.nowthisnews.com","pinnacle_base_url":"https:\/\/www.nowthisnews.com"}},{"name":"NowThis News","parent_tid":"135815","tid":4818022,"meta":{"default_image":"2827662","display_name":"","vortex_company_id":"0","zuul_company_id":"0","pinnacle_preview_base_url":"https:\/\/admin-preview.nowthisnews.com","pinnacle_base_url":"https:\/\/nowthisnews.com"}}],"tags":[{"name":"racism","parent_tid":"0","tid":137896},{"name":"internet","parent_tid":"0","tid":140093},{"name":"viral","parent_tid":"0","tid":140675},{"name":"mental health","parent_tid":"0","tid":141876}],"platform compatibility":[{"name":"Apple News","parent_tid":"0","tid":135896},{"name":"Facebook Instant","parent_tid":"0","tid":33821},{"name":"Google AMP","parent_tid":"0","tid":33822},{"name":"Search Engines","parent_tid":"0","tid":33953}],"vertical":[{"name":"News","parent_tid":"0","tid":136238,"meta":{"is_primary":"true","seo_description":"","seo_title":"","sponsor":""}}],"reporting category":[{"name":"Editorial","parent_tid":"0","tid":33734}],"topic":[{"name":"Must Watch","parent_tid":"0","tid":4652581,"meta":{"default_topic_header":"2727934","flags":"","name":"","seo_description":"All the most incredible must-watch videos you can see right now from NowThis","seo_title":"Must Watch: Daily Video News - NowThis","social_description":"","social_title":"","sponsor":"","subtitle":"Seeing is definitely believing.

But, among everything, he stressed the importance of people, particularly young people, getting out and voting.\r\n\r\n\u201cIf we [vote], then that set of values that the majority of the American people hold dear will be reflected,\u201d he stated. \u201cAnd... it doesn\u2019t mean every problem will be solved, but we won\u2019t be concerned about the continuity of our democracy, and the fact that ultimately it\u2019s accountable to the people.\u201d\r\n","company":["NowThis"],"is_closed":false,"is_event":false,"is_allied":false,"is_sponsored":false,"url":["videos\/politics\/barack-obama-answers-the-burning-question-is-america-going-to-be-ok","videos\/barack-obama-answers-the-burning-question-is-america-going-to-be-ok"],"uid_ii":582,"id":"node-5018358","new_taxonomy":{"company":[{"name":"NowThis","parent_tid":"0","tid":135815,"meta":{"default_image":"2700833","display_name":"","vortex_company_id":"0","zuul_company_id":"0","pinnacle_preview_base_url":"https:\/\/admin-preview.nowthisnews.com","pinnacle_base_url":"https:\/\/www.nowthisnews.com"}},{"name":"NowThis","parent_tid":"0","tid":135815,"meta":{"default_image":"2700833","display_name":"","vortex_company_id":"0","zuul_company_id":"0","pinnacle_preview_base_url":"https:\/\/admin-preview.nowthisnews.com","pinnacle_base_url":"https:\/\/www.nowthisnews.com"}},{"name":"NowThis News","parent_tid":"135815","tid":4818022,"meta":{"default_image":"2827662","display_name":"","vortex_company_id":"0","zuul_company_id":"0","pinnacle_preview_base_url":"https:\/\/admin-preview.nowthisnews.com","pinnacle_base_url":"https:\/\/nowthisnews.com"}}],"tags":[{"name":"barack obama","parent_tid":"0","tid":137829},{"name":"america","parent_tid":"0","tid":137367},{"name":"elections","parent_tid":"0","tid":4811155},{"name":"President","parent_tid":"0","tid":136537}],"platform compatibility":[{"name":"Apple News","parent_tid":"0","tid":135896},{"name":"Facebook Instant","parent_tid":"0","tid":33821},{"name":"Google AMP","parent_tid":"0","tid":33822},{"name":"Search Engines","parent_tid":"0","tid":33953}],"vertical":[{"name":"Politics","parent_tid":"0","tid":135919,"meta":{"is_primary":"true","seo_description":"","seo_title":"","sponsor":""}}],"reporting category":[{"name":"Editorial","parent_tid":"0","tid":33734}],"topic":[{"name":"VOTE 20","parent_tid":"0","tid":4812551,"meta":{"default_topic_header":"2786185","flags":"","name":"","seo_description":"","seo_title":"","social_description":"","social_title":"","sponsor":"","subtitle":"Some of the most important elections of our time are fast approaching.

But according to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, the richest one percent will have received 83% of the tax cut.\r\n","company":["NowThis"],"is_closed":false,"is_event":false,"is_allied":false,"is_sponsored":false,"url":["videos\/politics\/robert-reich-on-the-failure-of-the-gop-tax-law","videos\/robert-reich-on-the-failure-of-the-gop-tax-law"],"uid_ii":582,"id":"node-5023534","new_taxonomy":{"company":[{"name":"NowThis","parent_tid":"0","tid":135815,"meta":{"default_image":"2700833","display_name":"","vortex_company_id":"0","zuul_company_id":"0","pinnacle_preview_base_url":"https:\/\/admin-preview.nowthisnews.com","pinnacle_base_url":"https:\/\/www.nowthisnews.com"}},{"name":"NowThis","parent_tid":"0","tid":135815,"meta":{"default_image":"2700833","display_name":"","vortex_company_id":"0","zuul_company_id":"0","pinnacle_preview_base_url":"https:\/\/admin-preview.nowthisnews.com","pinnacle_base_url":"https:\/\/www.nowthisnews.com"}},{"name":"NowThis News","parent_tid":"135815","tid":4818022,"meta":{"default_image":"2827662","display_name":"","vortex_company_id":"0","zuul_company_id":"0","pinnacle_preview_base_url":"https:\/\/admin-preview.nowthisnews.com","pinnacle_base_url":"https:\/\/nowthisnews.com"}}],"tags":[{"name":"Trump","parent_tid":"0","tid":136722},{"name":"tax cuts","parent_tid":"0","tid":148019},{"name":"money","parent_tid":"0","tid":136711},{"name":"country","parent_tid":"0","tid":141165}],"platform compatibility":[{"name":"Apple News","parent_tid":"0","tid":135896},{"name":"Facebook Instant","parent_tid":"0","tid":33821},{"name":"Google AMP","parent_tid":"0","tid":33822},{"name":"Search Engines","parent_tid":"0","tid":33953}],"vertical":[{"name":"Politics","parent_tid":"0","tid":135919,"meta":{"is_primary":"true","seo_description":"","seo_title":"","sponsor":""}}],"reporting category":[{"name":"Editorial","parent_tid":"0","tid":33734}],"topic":[{"name":"Trump's America","parent_tid":"0","tid":4652574,"meta":{"default_topic_header":"2719125","flags":"","name":"","seo_description":"The most important video news, interviews, investigative reports and opinions regarding President Trump and the state of politics in America","seo_title":"Trump's America: President Trump News & Politics in America - NowThis","social_description":"","social_title":"","sponsor":"","subtitle":"It's never been more important to look for the truth.

Murphy is calling out the NCAA for exploiting players.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s no arguing that there\u2019s a magic to March Madness. College sports are a big part of our culture, there\u2019s a lot of good in college sports for athletes and for schools,\u201d he stated. \u201cBut there\u2019s also something rotten about an industry that generates billions of dollars in money for everybody except the student athletes actually playing in the games.\u201d<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nCollege sports has recently become a money-making and money-spending machine, with revenues more than tripling since 2003.

Access to contraception and sex education is the only proven way to reduce abortions, because they comprehensively reduce the amount of unplanned pregnancies in the first place.\r\n","company":["NowThis"],"is_closed":false,"is_event":false,"is_allied":false,"is_sponsored":false,"url":["videos\/news\/heres-why-georgias-heartbeat-bill-affects-all-americans","videos\/heres-why-georgias-heartbeat-bill-affects-all-americans"],"uid_ii":582,"id":"node-5030105","new_taxonomy":{"company":[{"name":"NowThis","parent_tid":"0","tid":135815,"meta":{"default_image":"2700833","display_name":"","vortex_company_id":"0","zuul_company_id":"0","pinnacle_preview_base_url":"https:\/\/admin-preview.nowthisnews.com","pinnacle_base_url":"https:\/\/www.nowthisnews.com"}},{"name":"NowThis","parent_tid":"0","tid":135815,"meta":{"default_image":"2700833","display_name":"","vortex_company_id":"0","zuul_company_id":"0","pinnacle_preview_base_url":"https:\/\/admin-preview.nowthisnews.com","pinnacle_base_url":"https:\/\/www.nowthisnews.com"}},{"name":"NowThis News","parent_tid":"135815","tid":4818022,"meta":{"default_image":"2827662","display_name":"","vortex_company_id":"0","zuul_company_id":"0","pinnacle_preview_base_url":"https:\/\/admin-preview.nowthisnews.com","pinnacle_base_url":"https:\/\/nowthisnews.com"}}],"tags":[{"name":"georgia","parent_tid":"0","tid":143095},{"name":"alabama","parent_tid":"0","tid":142207},{"name":"heartbeat bill","parent_tid":"0","tid":4817786},{"name":"explainer","parent_tid":"0","tid":143279}],"platform compatibility":[{"name":"Apple News","parent_tid":"0","tid":135896},{"name":"Facebook Instant","parent_tid":"0","tid":33821},{"name":"Google AMP","parent_tid":"0","tid":33822},{"name":"Search Engines","parent_tid":"0","tid":33953}],"vertical":[{"name":"News","parent_tid":"0","tid":136238,"meta":{"is_primary":"true","seo_description":"","seo_title":"","sponsor":""}}],"reporting category":[{"name":"Editorial","parent_tid":"0","tid":33734}],"topic":[{"name":"Must Watch","parent_tid":"0","tid":4652581,"meta":{"default_topic_header":"2727934","flags":"","name":"","seo_description":"All the most incredible must-watch videos you can see right now from NowThis","seo_title":"Must Watch: Daily Video News - NowThis","social_description":"","social_title":"","sponsor":"","subtitle":"Seeing is definitely believing.
