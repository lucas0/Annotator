The Attorney General had administrative responsibility for pardon application review, 1853-70, although the Department of State continued to issue pardon warrants until a Presidential order of June 6, 1893, transferred this function to the Department of Justice. Pardon responsibilities were delegated to the Office of the Clerk of Pardons, established in the Office of the Attorney General by an act of March 3, 1865 (13 Stat. 516). The Office of the Clerk of Pardons became a component of the newly created Department of Justice, pursuant to its enabling act, June 22, 1870 (16 Stat. 162). It was superseded by the Office of the Attorney in Charge of Pardons, established in the Department of Justice by an act of March 3, 1891 (26 Stat. 946), and re-designated the Office of the Pardon Attorney in 1894.

Superior Court.  An offense that violates a state law is not an offense against the United States.  A person who wishes to seek a pardon or a commutation of sentence for a state offense should contact the authorities of the state in which the conviction occurred.  Such state authorities are typically the Governor or a state board of pardons and/or paroles, if the state government has created such a board. </div></div></fieldset>

</div><fieldset class="collapse-text-fieldset collapsible form-wrapper collapse-processed"><legend><span class="fieldset-legend"><a class="fieldset-title" href="#"><span class="fieldset-legend-prefix element-invisible">Hide</span> What is the difference between a commutation of sentence and a pardon?</a><span class="summary"></span></span></legend><div class="fieldset-wrapper"><div class="collapse-text-text"> In the federal system, commutation of sentence and pardon are different forms of executive clemency, which is a broad term that applies to the President’s constitutional power to exercise leniency toward persons who have committed federal crimes.<p></p>
<p>A commutation of sentence reduces a sentence, either totally or partially, that is then being served, but it does not change the fact of conviction, imply innocence, or remove civil disabilities that apply to the convicted person as a result of the criminal conviction. A commutation may include remission (release) of the financial obligations that are imposed as part of a sentence, such as payment of a fine or restitution. A remission applies only to the part of the financial obligation that has not already been paid. A commutation of sentence has no effect on a person’s immigration status and will not prevent removal or deportation from the United States. To be eligible to apply for commutation of sentence, a person must have reported to prison to begin serving his sentence and may not be challenging his conviction in the courts.</p>
<p>A pardon is an expression of the President’s forgiveness and ordinarily is granted in recognition of the applicant’s acceptance of responsibility for the crime and established good conduct for a significant period of time after conviction or completion of sentence. It does not signify innocence. It does, however, remove civil disabilities – e.g., restrictions on the right to vote, hold state or local office, or sit on a jury – imposed because of the conviction for which pardon is sought, and should lessen the stigma arising from the conviction. It may also be helpful in obtaining licenses, bonding, or employment. Under some – but not all – circumstances, a pardon will eliminate the legal basis for removal or deportation from the United States. Pursuant to the Rules Governing Petitions for Executive Clemency, which are available on this website, a person is not eligible to apply for a presidential pardon until a minimum of five years has elapsed since his release from any form of confinement imposed upon him as part of a sentence for his most recent criminal conviction, whether or not that is the conviction for which he is seeking the pardon. </p></div></div></fieldset>

Some, but not all, states have instituted procedures for restoring to their citizens certain basic civil rights, such as the rights to vote, hold office, or sit on a jury, even if the disqualifying felony conviction was incurred in federal court. A person who is considering applying for a presidential pardon solely to restore such rights may wish to contact the appropriate clemency authorities within the state of his residence to ascertain whether such a procedure exists in that state. </div></div></fieldset>

At present, a presidential pardon is the only means by which a person convicted of a federal felony offense may obtain relief from federal firearms disabilities. Under Supreme Court case law interpreting federal firearms laws, a state restoration of civil rights does not remove the federal firearm disability that arises from a federal felony conviction. That relief can only be provided through action under federal law. Although 18 U.S.C. § 925(c) provides that the Attorney General may grant relief from federal firearms disabilities “if it is established to his satisfaction that . . . the applicant will not be likely to act in a manner dangerous to public safety and that the granting of the relief would not be contrary to the public interest,” there currently is no means to obtain relief through this mechanism. Since Fiscal Year 1992, Congress has prohibited the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, the agency responsible for processing such requests, from spending any appropriated funds to investigate or act upon applications for such relief. Accordingly, at this time a presidential pardon is the only means by which a person convicted of a federal felony may obtain this relief. </div></div></fieldset>

In many instances, this process requires the Pardon Attorney to obtain information or comments from other agencies, which in turn may have to obtain records from off-site storage in order to respond to the Pardon Attorney's inquiry. After all relevant information has been received, the Pardon Attorney prepares a proposed recommendation for disposition of the case that is submitted to the Deputy Attorney General, who makes the final determination of the Justice Department’s recommendation to the President. The Deputy Attorney General’s signed recommendation is then transmitted to the White House, and the President acts on each case when he believes it is appropriate to do so. As a matter of long-standing policy, the Pardon Attorney does not disclose to applicants or third parties the stage at which a clemency application is pending at any given time. After the President decides to grant or deny a particular clemency request, the Pardon Attorney notifies the applicant of the decision in writing. Because the written notification is sent to the last address an applicant has provided to the Pardon Attorney, it is important that an applicant notify the Pardon Attorney if his address changes while the application is under consideration. </div></div></fieldset>

The YCA was repealed in 1984. If an individual sentenced under the YCA was released from imprisonment or discharged from probation prior to the expiration of the maximum period sentenced, the conviction was automatically set aside upon the sentencing court’s issuance of a certificate of set-aside. Unfortunately, the certificate required to set aside the conviction was often not issued accordingly; thus leaving the conviction intact. If you were convicted under the YCA and are in possession of the certificate of set-aside issued by the court, there is, in fact, no conviction to pardon. Our office would, therefore, be unable to process your application, and you may wish to contact the closest division office of the FBI and ask that your criminal history record be properly amended to reflect the lack of conviction. If you believe you were convicted under the YCA, but are not in possession of the certificate of set-aside, then your conviction may still stand and you may submit a pardon application. If we are able to obtain evidence that a certificate of set-aside was, in fact, issued in your case, you will be  notified of that fact and your case file will be closed administratively. If we are unable to conclude that a certificate of set-aside was issued in your case, we will process your pardon application fully. </div></div></fieldset>

<p>Notwithstanding this policy, the President always retains the plenary power granted to him by the Constitution to pardon or commute sentences, and does so at his sole discretion, guided when he sees fit by the advice of the Pardon Attorney. </p></div></div></fieldset>
