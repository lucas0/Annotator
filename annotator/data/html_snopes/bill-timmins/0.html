<p>Response to Michael Moore's, "Open Letter to Bill Timmins, President Aladdin Casino and Hotel" </p><p>As you most likely know, Michael Moore posted the following letter: After the letter, you will find the response... </p><p>Open Letter to Bill Timmins, President Aladdin Casino and Hotel http://www.michaelmoore.com/words/index.php?id=93 </p><p>Bill Timmins President Aladdin Casino and Hotel Las Vegas, NV </p><p>July 20, 2004 </p><p>Dear Mr. Timmins: </p><p>I understand from the news reports I've read that, after Linda Ronstadt, one of America's greatest singers, dedicated a song to me from your stage on Saturday night, you instructed your security guards to remove her from the Aladdin, which they did. </p><p>What country do you live in? Last time I checked, Las Vegas is still in the United States. And in the United States, we have something called "The First Amendment." This constitutional right gives everyone here the right to say whatever they want to say. All Americans hold this right as sacred. Many of our young people put on a uniform and risk their lives to defend it. My film is all about asking the questions that should have been asked before those brave soldiers were sent into harms way. </p><p>For you to throw Linda Ronstadt off the premises because she dared to say a few words in support of me and my film, is simply stupid and Un-American. Frankly, I have never heard of such a thing happening. I read that you wouldn't even let her go back up to her room at your hotel! Are you crazy? For crying out loud, it was a song DEDICATION! To "Desperado!" Every American loves that song! Sure, some people didn't like the dedication, and that's their right. But neither they nor you have the right to remove her from your building when all she did was exercise her AMERICAN right to speak her mind. </p><p>Of all the things that go on in Las Vegas, this is what creates the need for serious action? What about the other half of the crowd at the Aladdin who, according to the Las Vegas Sun, cheered her when she made her remarks? Did you throw them out, too? </p><p>I think you owe Ms. Ronstadt an apology. And I have an idea how you can make it up to her -- and to the millions of Americans you have offended. Invite her back and I'll join her in singing "America the Beautiful" on your stage. Then I will show "Fahrenheit 9/11" free of charge to all your guests and anyone else in Las Vegas who wants to see it. </p><p>Mr. Timmins, as the song "Desperado" says -- "Come to your senses!" How can you refuse this offer? I await your reply. </p><p>Yours, Michael Moore Director, "Fahrenheit 9/11" </p><p>=============================================== Response =============================================== </p><p>July 21, 2004 </p><p>Attention: Michael Moore, </p><p>In response to your letter dated July 20, 2004: You are correct that I had security remove Linda Ronstadt from Aladdin Casino and Hotel where the fun never ends and everybody wins. How very interesting to learn you are such a fan of Ms. Ronstadt. </p><p>You questioned where I live and surprisingly knew Las Vegas is in the United States. You should visit it sometime. There are thousands of wonderful 'All You Can Eat' buffets. </p><p>There are also a lot of casinos who's owners don't **** around. I am aware of the First Amendment and you have the right to talk about your hatred of America but once you are on my property and you are upsetting my guests, you will quickly learn about my rights. </p><p>I can't remember if it was Jesus or George W. Bush that said, "Freedom is a two-way street." Ms. Ronstadt learned this long before I had her thrown out of my casino. You question my actions? If you come onto my property and upset my guests, you will receive the same, if not worse, treatment than Ms. Ronstadt received. I am sure your mere presence would upset my guests. </p><p>You claim you film, "...is all about asking the questions that should have been asked before those brave soldiers were sent into harms way." I think you film does nothing but aid the enemy and hurt our troops. You have betrayed our troops, our leader and America. I have no respect for you or your vision of what America should be. </p><p>I paid Ms. Ronstadt to entertain my guests, not divide them. The half that did not leave probably thought the verse you mentioned, "Why don't you come to your senses" was addressed to you. Maybe she should have dedicated her song, 'You're No Good' to you. I would have asked her back, had she done that. </p><p>Regarding your request for me to apologize to her, have you and her on my stage singing anything about this Country and then playing your piece of **** film is ludicrous! </p><p>One of my workers is currently throwing away every complaint letter from brainless followers of you, claiming they will never visit my Casino. I could not be more pleased to know my casino and hotel will always be void of the kind of people who support you. Meanwhile, my hotel has been quickly booked solid for the rest of the year with true Americans who love this Country and support our efforts overseas. </p><p>They will see a framed copy of your letter and my response in the lobby to ensure they begin their experience with a laugh. </p><p>Sincerely, </p><p>Bill Timmins President Aladdin Casino and Hotel Las Vegas, NV<br clear="all"/></p>

<p>LOL! Sorry everyone. I should have written, "Suggested reply to Moore's letter." I Didn't mean to create a fib. <br/> <br/>I registered here a long time ago but I have not been back in a while. I have been battling the liberals over here: <a href="http://boards.biography.com/forum.jsp?forum=494">http://boards.biography.com/forum.jsp?forum=494</a> <br/> <br/>I need to re-learn how this board works. It's so big! <br/>It is very refreshing to be around like-minded people.</p>

    My Dear Mr. Moore:<p> I cannot tell you how disppointed I was to find that MY viewpoint was NOT included in YOUR movie. What country do you live in? Last I checked, Hollywood was still part of the United States, and we have something called THE FIRST AMENDMENT. Do I not have an equal right with you to have MY viewpoint screened? What kind of brown-shirted jack-booted stunt are you trying to pull? </p><p> But now the deed has been done, there is no way to remake the movie. There really is no way to make amends. Perhaps I would be willing to settle for 10% of the take if accompanied by a simple apology.</p><p> With all (and I do mean ALL) due respect,</p><p> Your baseball-capped Michigan truck-driving nemesis,</p><p> Skinny Phil

<i>But neither they nor you have the right to remove her from your building when all she did was exercise her AMERICAN right to speak her mind. </i><p> Private property rights.

She knows that this has been the response in the past. Only this time it got press.
