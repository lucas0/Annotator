<h1 class="tei-head7">The Soviet Invasion of Afghanistan and the U.S. Response, 1978–1980</h1>
<p class="tei-p2">At the end of December 1979, the Soviet Union sent thousands of troops into
                        <span class="tei-placeName">Afghanistan</span> and immediately assumed complete military
                    and political control of <span class="tei-placeName">Kabul</span> and large portions of the
                    country. This event began a brutal, decade-long attempt by Moscow to subdue the
                    Afghan civil war and maintain a friendly and socialist government on its border.
                    It was a watershed event of the Cold War, marking the only time the Soviet Union
                    invaded a country outside the Eastern Bloc—a strategic decision met by nearly
                    worldwide condemnation. While the massive, lightning-fast military maneuvers and
                    brazenness of Soviet political objectives constituted an “invasion” of
                    Afghanistan, the word “intervention” more accurately describes these events as
                    the culmination of growing Soviet domination going back to 1973. Undoubtedly,
                    leaders in the Kremlin had hoped that a rapid and complete military takeover
                    would secure Afghanistan’s place as an exemplar of the Brezhnev Doctrine, which
                    held that once a country became socialist Moscow would never permit it to return
                    to the capitalist camp. The United States and its European allies, guided by
                    their own doctrine of containment, sharply criticized the Soviet move into
                    Afghanistan and devised numerous measures to compel Moscow to withdraw.</p>

</div>
<p class="tei-p2">In the summer of 1973, <span class="tei-persName">Mohammed Daoud</span>, the former Afghan
                    Prime Minister, launched a successful coup against King Zahir. Although Daoud
                    himself was more nationalist than socialist, his coup was dependent on
                    pro-Soviet military and political factions. Since 1955 Moscow had provided
                    military training and materiel to Afghanistan; by 1973, a third of active troops
                    had trained on Soviet soil. Additionally, Daoud enjoyed the support of the
                    People’s Democratic Party of Afghanistan (PDPA), founded in 1965 upon Marxist
                    ideology and allegiance to Moscow. In 1967 the PDPA split into two factions: the
                    Parchamists, led by <span class="tei-persName">Babrak Karmal</span> (who supported Daoud),
                    and the “Khalqis” led by Noor Taraki. For the next five years, Daoud attempted
                    the impossible task of governing Afganistan’s Islamic tribal regions, while also
                    struggling to reconcile the PDPA split. But the more radical Khalq faction never
                    fully recognized Daoud’s leadership, while Karmal viewed the coup largely as a
                    means to consolidate his own power. In response, Daoud hoped to mitigate both of
                    these threats by steering Afghanistan away from Soviet influence and improving
                    U.S. relations, while decreasing the influence of radical elements in the
                    government and military.</p>
<p class="tei-p2">Daoud’s middle course ended in disaster. On April 28, 1978, soldiers aligned with
                    Taraki’s “Khalq” faction assaulted the presidential palace, where troops
                    executed Daoud and his family. In the following days Taraki became the Prime
                    Minister, and, in an attempt to end the PDPA’s divisions, Karmal became Deputy
                    Prime Minister. In Washington, this Communist revolution was met with alarm. The
                    Carter administration recognized that Taraki would undo Daoud’s attempt to steer
                    Afghanistan away from Moscow, and it debated whether to cut ties with
                    Afghanistan or recognize Taraki in the hopes that Soviet influence could be
                    contained. Although the President’s Assistant for National Security Affairs
                    Zbigniew Brzezinski advocated the former course, Carter supported the Department
                    of State’s advocacy of recognition. Shortly after the revolution, Washington
                    recognized the new government and soon named Adolph Dubs its Ambassador to
                    Afghanistan. Until his kidnapping and death at the hands of Afghan Shia
                    dissidents in February 1979, Dubs strongly pursued good relations with the
                    Taraki regime in the hopes that U.S. support would keep Soviet influence at
                    bay.</p>
<p class="tei-p2">Once again, the tumult of internal Afghan politics complicated both U.S. and
                    Soviet jockeying. In the summer of 1979, <span class="tei-persName">Hafizullah Amin</span>, a
                    longtime ally of Taraki who became Deputy Prime Minister following the April
                    Revolution, received word that Babrak Karmal (Daoud’s early supporter) was
                    leading a Parcham plot to overthrow the Taraki regime. Amin took the opportunity
                    to purge and execute many Parchamists and consolidate his own power.
                    Complicating matters further, this internal strife damaged the Kabul
                    Government’s major national program, namely, to bring the Communist revolution
                    to the Islamic tribal areas beyond Kabul. By the winter of 1978, this program
                    was met by armed revolt throughout the country. In response, Amin and Taraki
                    traveled to Moscow to sign a friendship treaty which included a provision that
                    would allow direct Soviet military assistance should the Islamic insurgency
                    threaten the regime. This insurrection intensified over the next year and it
                    became increasingly obvious to the Soviets that Taraki could not prevent all-out
                    civil war and the prospect of a hostile Islamic government taking control. By
                    mid-1979 Moscow was searching to replace Taraki and Amin, and dispatched combat
                    troops to Bagram Air Base outside of Kabul. This move prompted the Carter
                    administration to begin supplying non-lethal aid to Afghan <span class="tei-hi1">mujahedeen</span>, or Islamic insurgents. In August, a high-ranking Soviet
                    military delegation arrived in Kabul to assess the situation. U.S. officials
                    interpreted this mission as one last Soviet attempt to shore up the Taraki
                    regime, and also an opportunity to devise a military takeover. Regarding the
                    latter, most analysts in Washington believed that such a move remained possible
                    but unlikely.</p>
<p class="tei-p2">But this calculus was bound to change. Amin sensed the Soviet mission was
                    designed to strengthen Taraki at his expense. In response, forces loyal to Amin
                    executed Taraki in October—a move that infuriated Moscow, which began amassing
                    combat units along its border. At this juncture Washington was still unsure how
                    to interpret the Soviet maneuvers: was the Soviet Union planning a full takeover
                    or did it remain committed to preserving the April Revolution? Analysts remained
                    skeptical that Moscow would occupy the country given the political and economic
                    costs. By the winter of 1979, faced with mutinies and an uncertain leadership,
                    the Afghan Army was unable to provide basic security to the government against
                    the onslaught of Islamic fighters nearing Kabul. By that point the Soviets were
                    sending in motorized divisions and Special Forces. Washington demanded an
                    explanation, which the Soviets ignored. Finally, on Christmas Eve, the invasion
                    began. Soviet troops killed Amin and installed Babrak Karmal as the Soviet’s
                    puppet head of government.</p>
<p class="tei-p2">Although the Carter administration had closely watched this buildup from the
                    outset, its reaction following the invasion revealed that, until the end, it
                    clung to the hope that the Soviets would not invade, based on the unjustified
                    assumption that Moscow would conclude that the costs of invasion were too high.
                    In response, Carter wrote a sharply-worded letter to Brezhnev denouncing Soviet
                    aggression, and during his State of the Union address he announced his own
                    doctrine vowing to protect Middle Eastern oil supplies from encroaching Soviet
                    power. The administration also enacted economic sanctions and trade embargoes
                    against the Soviet Union, called for a boycott of the 1980 Moscow Olympics, and
                    stepped up its aid to the Afghan insurgents. In sum, these actions were
                    Washington’s collective attempt to make the Soviets’ “adventure” in Afghanistan
                    as painful and brief as possible. Instead, it took ten years of grinding
                    insurgency before Moscow finally withdrew, at the cost of millions of lives and
                    billions of dollars. In their wake, the Soviets left a shattered country in
                    which the Taliban, an Islamic fundamentalist group, seized control, later
                    providing <span class="tei-persName">Osama bin Laden</span> with a training base from which
                    to launch terrorist operations worldwide.</p>
