For the exercise of rights and constitutional guarantees, no conditions or requirements shall be established other than those set forth in the Constitution or by law.<br style="text-align:left;"/>

9. The State’s supreme duty consists of respecting and enforcing respect for the rights guaranteed in the Constitution.<br style="text-align:left;"/>
