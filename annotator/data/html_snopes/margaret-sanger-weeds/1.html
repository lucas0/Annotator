        Margaret Sanger, <i>Woman and the New Race</i>.[1]</p>
<p><b>Anti-Life Philosophy.</b></p>
<p>Anti-choice fanatics are smearing the memory of Planned Parenthood's
        saintly founder, Margaret Sanger, with unfounded lies and distortions.
        She was a noble health professional who simply wanted to improve the lot
        of poor women by providing basic information on birth control. This
        allowed them to finally end the plague of unwanted children, so that
        they could turn their attention towards bettering the lot of themselves
        and their families.</p>
<p>As the former President of Planned Parenthood, Faye Wattleton, so
        insightfully said; "No one can really interpret what Sanger meant
        because she's <i>dead</i>."[2]</p>
<p><b>Introduction.</b></p>
<p>Margaret Sanger was born an innocent baby in 1879 and died a bisexual
        Demerol and alcohol addict who spawned the most monstrous organization
        ever conceived the International Planned Parenthood Federation (IPPF).</p>
<p>Sanger was a proponent of forced eugenics, free love, and birth
        control and abortion. More than any other entities, Margaret Sanger and
        her organization were responsible for the so-called 'sexual revolution'
        which has destroyed millions of families, debased countless women, and
        paved the way for tens of millions of people to wallow in the pit of
        sexual addiction which, worst of all, leads in most cases to a total
        loss of conscience.</p>
<p><b><span style="text-transform: uppercase">Physically, Mentally, and
        Emotionally Handicapped Beware!</span></b></p>
<p><b>Introduction. </b></p>
<p>The fact that Margaret Sanger was this country's foremost proponent
        and advocate of eugenics is little known, and Planned Parenthood would
        dearly love to keep this information secret. Witness PP's comically
        desperate efforts to 'keep the lid on' when Pat Robertson publicized
        Sanger's past during the 1988 Presidential primary campaign.</p>
<p>Maggie Sanger Eugenicist. There can be no doubt that Sanger
        wholeheartedly supported eugenics, which was the underpinning of the
        Nazi genocide program, as shown by her many quotes in Figure 68-1.</p>

<p>We should hire three or four colored ministers, preferably with
          social-service backgrounds, and with engaging personalities. The most
          successful educational approach to the Negro is through a religious
          appeal. We don't want the word to go out that we want to exterminate
          the Negro population, and the minister is the man who can straighten

<blockquote>
<p>Our failure to segregate morons who are increasing and multiplying
          ... demonstrates our foolhardy and extravagant sentimentalism ...
          [Philanthropists] encourage the healthier and more normal sections of
          the world to shoulder the burden of unthinking and indiscriminate
          fecundity of others; which brings with it, as I think the reader must
          agree, a dead weight of human waste. Instead of decreasing and aiming
          to eliminate the stocks that are most detrimental to the future of the
          race and the world, it tends to render them to a menacing degree
          dominant ... We are paying for, and even submitting to, the dictates
          of an ever-increasing, unceasingly spawning class of human beings who
          never should have been born at all.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Today eugenics is suggested by the most diverse minds as the most
          adequate and thorough avenue to the solution of racial, political and
          social problems.</p>
<p>I think you must agree ... that the campaign for birth control is
          not merely of eugenic value, but is practically identical with the
          final aims of eugenics ... Birth control propaganda is thus the
          entering wedge for the eugenic educator.</p>
<p>As an advocate of birth control I wish ... to point out that the
          unbalance between the birth rate of the 'unfit' and the 'fit,'
          admittedly the greatest present menace to civilization, can never be
          rectified by the inauguration of a cradle competition between these
          two classes. In this matter, the example of the inferior classes, the
          fertility of the feeble-minded, the mentally defective, the
          poverty-stricken classes, should not be held up for emulation.</p>
<p>On the contrary, the most urgent problem today is how to limit and
          discourage the over-fertility of the mentally and physically
          defective.</p>

        more than 500 members of the Eugenics Society from 1907 to the present.</p>
<p>Sanger traveled all over the world in pursuit of the promotion of
        eugenics, birth control, and population control. On one occasion, she
        even met with Mahatma Gandhi in an attempt to get him to endorse birth
        control for the purpose of controlling his country's population. His
        words to Sanger was typically gentle, but in reality represented a
        stinging rebuke to her anti-life cause; </p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the light of what I have said above, birth control by
          contraceptives and the like is a profound error. I write thus with a
          full sense of my responsibility. I have great regard for Mrs. Margaret
          Sanger and her followers. She impressed me much by her great zeal for
          her cause. I know that she has great sympathy for the women who suffer
          because they have to bear the burden of a lifetime of carrying and
          rearing unwanted children. I know also that this method of birth
          control has the support of many Protestant divines, scientists,
          learned men, and doctors, many of whom I have the honour of knowing
          personally and for whom I entertain high regard. But should I be false
          to my God who is Truth and nothing but the Truth, if I concealed my
          belief from the reader or these great advocates of the method. Indeed,
          if I hid my belief, I should never discover my error, if my present
          belief is one.[3]</p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>Maggie Sanger Racist. </b></p>
<p>Sanger was without question a racist of the first rank, and it is
        incomprehensible to most pro-life activists that she continues to be
        honored in this country. School films routinely portray her as a
        'pioneer for women's rights.' And the United States Postal Service
        issued a stamp in honor of her 100th birthday in 1979.</p>
<p>Human beings were nothing more than farm animals to Margaret Sanger,
        and this view is reflected in the terms she applied to those that did
        not measure up to her high standards of perfection. For example, she
        habitually referred to blacks and Jews as "bad stock." Her
        label for her dreamed-of Master Race was a "race of
        thoroughbreds," as described in the November 1921 <i>Birth Control
        Review</i>.</p>
<p>In the April 1933 issue of the same periodical, Sanger said that
        "[Slavs, Latin, and Hebrew immigrants are] human weeds ... a
        deadweight of human waste ... [Blacks, soldiers, and Jews are a] menace
        to the race. ... Eugenic sterilization is an urgent need ... We must
        prevent multiplication of this bad stock."</p>
<p>Sanger advocated a program that would;</p>
<blockquote>
<p> ... hire three or four colored ministers, preferably with
          social-service backgrounds, and with engaging personalities. The most
          successful educational approach to the Negro is through a religious
          appeal. We don't want the word to go out that we want to exterminate
          the Negro population, and the minister is the man who can straighten
          out that idea if it ever occurs to any of their more rebellious
          members.[4]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We must conclude from the above statements that Planned Parenthood
        possesses at least a rudimentary if crude sense of humor. The recipient
        of the 1963 Margaret Sanger Award (for outstanding dedication to PP's
        principles) was none other than Martin Luther King the best-known Black
        minister of his day!</p>
<p>Faye Wattleton, former president of the Planned Parenthood Federation
        of America (and who, amusingly, is herself Black), at PPFA's annual
        luncheon in St. Louis, on May 2, 1979, stated that "I believe
        Margaret Sanger would have been proud of us today if she had seen the
        directions that we have most recently in this organization
        taken."[5]</p>
<p>Even Marxist theorists, though so very blind in other areas,
        recognize the obviously racist nature of Planned Parenthood and the
        other population controllers. Alexander Cockburn wrote that "The
        not-so-concealed theme of some major figures in NARAL and NOW was that
        abortion should be legal because the most prolific breeders were welfare
        mothers from the dangerous classes ... the leader of NARAL in New York
        lobbied against the provisions to protect poor minority women from
        involuntary sterilization, and so did Planned Parenthood."[6]</p>
<p>Speaking of genetics and eugenics, Sanger apparently managed to pass
        on her poisoned bloodline to her grandson, Alexander C. Sanger, who
        became President and Chief Executive Officer of Planned Parenthood of
        New York City in January of 1991. This organization has a budget of $18
        million a year and 250 workers. The new menace boasted that </p>
<blockquote>
<p>I intend to be out on the front lines of our issues. That is why
          I'm here ... Right now, we have three clinics in this [New York] city
          and I want ten more. We currently have a small storefront office in
          central Harlem, and it is my first priority to see if we can transform
          that into a clinic ... With all her success, my grandmother left some
          unfinished business, and I intend to finish it.[7]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Seeing how his grandmother desired to "exterminate the Black
        race," a clinic in Harlem would be a great way to "finish
        it."</p>
<p><b>Margaret Sanger Anti-Family and Anti-Child.</b></p>
<blockquote>
<p>We are not going to be an organization promoting celibacy or
          chastity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>                                                                                                     
        Faye Wattleton.[8]</p>
<p>Although it comically refers to itself as "The largest
        pro-family organization in America," Planned Parenthood has done
        more than any other entity to tear at the foundations of family life.</p>
<p>PP supports sexual perversions of every type, abortion for any
        reason, euthanasia, permissive sex education, and school-based clinics,
        faithfully adhering to the tradition established by its dishonorable
        founder.</p>
<p>Margaret Sanger embraced literally any influence that could
        reasonably be expected to destroy family life and the relationships
        between spouses and parents and children. She claimed that "[Our
        objective is] unlimited sexual gratification without the burden of
        unwanted children." Her credo of women's rights was "to live
        ... to love ... to be lazy ... to be an unmarried mother ... to create
        ... to destroy." She also claimed that "The marriage bed is
        the most degenerative influence in the social order," and that
        "The most merciful thing that a family does to one of its infant
        members is to kill it."[1]</p>
<p>Sanger's anti-life and anti-family philosophy has been effectively
        passed down to almost all latter-day Planned Parenthood workers. One
        infallible method for predicting where Planned Parenthood or any of its
        workers will stand on any particular issue is to ask the question: Will
        the action under consideration weaken or strengthen the family? If the
        answer is that it will weaken the family, then PP will invariably
        support it.</p>
<p>As just one of many examples, a law that forbids husbands from
        protecting their preborn children in any way might be reasonably
        expected to weaken the relationship between spouses. Louise Tyrer,
        vice-president of medical affairs at Planned Parenthood, therefore
        opposes any rights for the fathers of preborn children; "But it
        doesn't matter how much men scream and holler that they are being left
        out [of the abortion decision]. There are some things that they are
        never going to be able to experience fully. I say, 'tough
        luck.'"[9]</p>
<p><b>Sanitizing History.</b></p>
<p>PP has its hands full sanitizing Sanger's rotten memory, and this
        sometimes leads to humorous or even ludicrous situations involving
        massive doses of damage control.</p>
<p>In early 1989, radio talk show host Jan Mickelson of Station WHO in
        Iowa conducted a mock interview of 'Sanger,' who was represented by a
        woman friend. The ersatz 'Sanger' quoted directly out of 'her' written
        works, and listeners heard the racist condemn Catholics, blacks, Jews,
        Slavs and others she considered "biologically unfit."</p>
<p>MIckelson never informed his audience that Sanger had died in 1966.</p>
<p>Planned Parenthood, which hates to see its corrupt and racist root
        system exposed, was understandably enraged. Its local director, Jill
        June, fumed that the show was a "terrible, cruel hoax." She
        went on to say that "We in Planned Parenthood are huge supporters
        of freedom of the press and free speech, but this represents a total
        breakdown in ethics in broadcast journalism."</p>
<p>This last statement brought gales of laughter from pro-life activists
        all over the nation, in light of the established fact that Planned
        Parenthood does its best to crush legal picketing, vocal dissent to its
        policies, and even informed consent for the abortion procedure itself.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Mickelson was strongly defended by his station manager,
        Steve Shannon.</p>
<p>It is interesting that Planned Parenthood has so much power that it
        can even censor books and what people can see regarding its history in
        public libraries. For example, the Oregon State Library lets its copy of
        Sanger's <i>Woman and the New Race</i> go with the utmost reluctance. A
        statement on the inside front cover warns; </p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is a restricted book not usually put on the open shelves, but
          lent only to mature readers. It does not mean that the book is a bad
          book, but that it might be offensive to some and possibly injurious to
          others. It is lent to patrons of the State Library with the
          understanding that it will not be handed to others nor generally
          circulated.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>According to Dr. Vincent Rue, post-abortion syndrome expert and
        co-director of the Institute for Abortion Recovery and Research, based
        in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, Planned Parenthood successfully pressured
        the publishers Harper &amp; Row into canceling Dr. Anne Speckhard's book
        <i>Psycho-Social Stress Following Abortion</i>.[10]</p>
<p>The book was finally published by Sheed and Ward.</p>
