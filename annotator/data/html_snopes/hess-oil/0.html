These technologies include the following:\u003c/p>\n\u003cul>\n\u003cli>\u003cstrong>Cookies\u003c/strong>.  Cookies are small text files that are sent to and stored by your browser when you visit or interact with our Website and ads. These cookies are then sent back to party that served the cookie unchanged each time you visit or interact with the Website or ads (which includes our ads on third-party sites) in order for the party that served the cookie to recognize your browser or device. Cookies are either first-party cookies or third-party cookies. &#8220;\u003cstrong>First-party cookies\u003c/strong>&#8221; are sent to your browser by the party that operates the site you are visiting (for example, cookies served by Sunoco when you visit the Website). &#8220;\u003cstrong>Third-party cookies\u003c/strong>&#8221; are sent to your browser by any party other than the party that operates the site you are visiting (for example, cookies sent by our online partners, such as Google Analytics, when you visit the Website). Further, when we use cookies, we may use &#8220;\u003cstrong>session\u003c/strong>&#8221; cookies (that last until you close your browser) or &#8220;\u003cstrong>persistent\u003c/strong>&#8221; cookies (that last until you or your browser delete them). Some of the cookies we use on the Website and our ads may be associated with your personal information (such as your email address) and other cookies are not.\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003cstrong>Pixel Tags\u003c/strong>.  Pixel tags (also known as web beacons) are small blocks of code installed on our Website which enable our online partners to serve cookies when you visit our Website and are generally used in combination with cookies to track activity user on our Website, receive relevant log data and cookie data, and perform other activities relating to the monitoring and analysis of the use and performance of the Website and our ads.\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003cstrong>Software Development Kits\u003c/strong>.  Software development kits (also called SDKs) function like third-party cookies and pixel tags, but operate in the mobile app environment where cookies and pixel tags cannot function as effectively. Instead of using cookies and pixels tags, we may install pieces of code (the SDK) provided by our online partners (such as advertising companies, ad networks, and analytics providers) in our mobile apps in order for these online partners to monitor and analyze the use and performance of our Website and ads.\u003c/li>\n\u003cli>\u003cstrong>Statistical Identifiers\u003c/strong>.  Statistical identifiers refers to identifiers created using certain device information and log data. Collectively, this information makes your browser or device sufficiently distinct for a server or similar system to reasonably determine that it is encountering the same browser or device over time. Statistical identifiers enable us and our partners to uniquely identify your browser or device for the same purposes as cookies. Statistical identifiers may be associated with your personal information (such as your email address).\u003c/li>\n\u003c/ul>\n\u003cp>\u003cem>\u003cstrong>Use of Cookies and Similar Technologies by Our Online Partners\u003c/strong>\u003c/em>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>We may use vendors and other online partners to perform some of the activities described above, including to provide audience measurement and analytics services, to serve ads on our behalf on our Website and on third-party sites, and to track and report on the performance of such ads. These online partners may use third-party cookies and similar technologies to collect and store certain device information, log data, cookie data and other information when you visit or interact with our Website or ads and other unaffiliated sites in order to identify your browser or device and provide their respective services. Further, these online partners may combine data collected on our Website with information collected on unaffiliated sites or with any other data maintained by these online partners. Their use of data collected on our Website and third-party sites will be subject to their own terms of use and privacy policies.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>For example, we may use third-party cookies to deliver our ads on third-party websites through a common form of online advertising known as &#8220;retargeting.&#8221; Retargeting works by serving ads on one website based on an individual&#8217;s activities on a different website (for example, if you view an product or service on our Website, you may later see ads for our products and services when you visit a third-party website). To do this, we allow our online partners (such as Google or other ad network vendors) to serve their own third-party cookies when users visit our Website, allowing these online partners to recognize users who have previously visited our Website. When these users visit a third-party website that includes features provided by our online partners (for example, where our online partners have purchased ad space), our online partners can recognize the users&#8217; interest in our products and services and deliver one of our ads on the third-party website.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>&nbsp;\u003c/p>\n\u003ch4>Your Cookie Choices\u003c/h4>\n\u003cp>Most web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. However, in addition to the specific opt-out mechanisms described above, you can typically choose to set your browser to remove or reject browser cookies. To do so, please follow the instructions provided by your browser which are usually located within the &#8220;Help&#8221; or &#8220;Preferences&#8221; menu.

When you visit our Website, the operator of the social plugin may be able to place a cookie on your browser or device, enabling that operator to recognize users who have previously visited our Website. If you have previously logged into the associated social media website (for example, Facebook or Twitter) before visiting our Website, the social plugin allows that social media website to receive information about your visit to particular pages on our Website. The social plugin may collect this information for any such users who have logged into social networks, whether or not they specifically interact with the plugin on our Website (for example, by clicking &#8220;Like&#8221; or &#8220;Share&#8221;). The social plugin may also allow the social media website to share information about your activities on our Website with other users of their social media website.

Rewards”), and accepting benefits therein through your use of the Sunoco Rewards Card, you hereby agree to be bound by these Terms and Conditions (“Agreement”), which solely govern how you may earn and redeem discounts on fuel purchases made with your Sunoco Rewards Card at participating Sunoco locations within the United States, except where prohibited by law. Except where expressly indicated, these limited Terms and Conditions are separate from any agreement you may have with any credit card issuer and/or financial institution governing your application for the Sunoco Rewards Card itself, and your mutual obligations therein regarding its use by you and authorized users after approval.\u003c/p>\n\u003ch3>\u003cb>Discounts\u003c/b>\u003c/h3>\n\u003cp>(1) When you use your Sunoco Rewards Card to purchase fuel, only at participating Sunoco locations, the price you pay will be reduced at the point of sale by five cents ($0.05) per gallon. Where available, for fuel purchases made at the pump the price per gallon will be reduced at the pump after you swipe your credit card, while for in-store fuel purchases the discount will be applied prior to the completion of your purchase.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>(2) In the event discounts at the point of sale are unavailable for any reason, you will receive the discounts as a statement credit applied monthly for qualifying purchases. In that case, you will not see a reduction in the price per gallon at the pump or prior to the completion of an in-store purchase. When calculating the amount of the statement credit, we will multiply the number of gallons purchased by five cents ($0.05) and round to the nearest cent. In the event gallon information is not available for a specific purchase, we will determine the number of gallons purchased by dividing the total purchase amount by the lowest price per gallon as published by Oil Price Information Service (OPIS) on the date of purchase for Sunoco branded stations regardless of fuel grade.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>(3) Discounts will only be earned on fuel purchases made for personal, family or household purposes by authorized users of the Sunoco Rewards Card. Your account must remain open and current in order for you to earn discounts. Statement credits and discounts provided pursuant to Sunoco Rewards are non-transferable for any reason, and Sunoco may at its sole discretion monitor Sunoco Rewards activity for any form of fraud or abuse, and may suspend or end your participation in Sunoco Rewards in the event of any improper or unauthorized activity, or in the event that your Card account is suspended or terminated by Citibank for any reason, or for any reason.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>(4) Discounts granted hereunder have no independent cash value beyond their exclusive use in connection with Sunoco Rewards.\u003c/p>\n\u003ch3>\u003cb>Miscellaneous\u003c/b>\u003c/h3>\n\u003cp>Sunoco reserves the right to modify, terminate, restrict, cancel or waive any portion or the entirety of Sunoco Rewards at any time, for any reason, with or without prior notice.  The use and collection of personally identifiable information by Sunoco, through your participation in Sunoco Rewards, and your interaction with Sunoco’s website and mobile applications as part of your participation in Sunoco Rewards, are governed (respectively) by the most recent version of Sunoco’s privacy policy and website terms and conditions, as modified from time to time, which are available at \u003ca href=\"http://www.sunocolp.com/privacy-policy/default.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.sunocolp.com/privacy-policy/default.aspx\u003c/a>, and which are incorporated by reference.
