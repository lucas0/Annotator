20, of Cedar Key, Florida.<br/>Killed in combat in the vicinity of An Nasiriyah. He was assigned to the 1st Battalion, 2nd Marine Regiment, 2nd Marine Expeditionary Brigade, Camp Lejeune, North Carolina. Died on March 23, 2003.</p>
<p class="bold">His father and grandfather had served in the Marines, and Buesing couldn't wait to enlist, joining less than a month after graduating from high school. "He never showed any sign of fear," says his stepfather, Roger Steve. Buesing was killed in a firefight with Iraqi soldiers who had feigned surrender.</p>

<p>""My estimate of him was formed on the battlefield many, many years ago, and has never changed. I regard him then as I regard him now -- as one of the world's noblest figures, not only as one of the finest military characters, but also as one of the most stainless. His name and fame are the birthright of every American citizen. In his youth and strength, his love and loyalty, he gave all that mortality can give. He needs no eulogy from me or from any other man. He has written his own history and written it in red on his enemy's breast. But when I think of his patience under adversity, of his courage under fire, and of his modesty in victory, I am filled with an emotion of admiration I cannot put into words. He belongs to history as furnishing one of the greatest examples of successful patriotism. He belongs to posterity as the instructor of future generations in the principles of liberty and freedom. He belongs to the present, to us, by his virtues and by his achievements. I have witnessed that enduring fortitude, that patriotic self-abnegation, and that invincible determination which have carved his statue in the hearts of his people. From one end of the world to the other he has drained deep the chalice of courage.""<br/><span>SFC Howard C. Hudson, Ret of Myrtle Creek, Oregon</span></p>
<p>"Thank you for being so brave. The amount of respect I hold for you and every single soldier is beyond words."<br/><span>Maggie Austin of Normal, IL ISU</span></p>

<p>"LCpl Buesing,<br/>I thank you and your family for your service. I wear a black bracelet inscribed with your name to remind me and others of the sacrifices made by our brave American servicemembers. Semper Fi, Marine. You're a true hero in my eyes."<br/><span>Rob Blissett of Dallas, Texas, USA</span></p>
<p>"Brian, it`s been 2 years now sinse you were called upon, and we still remember.<br/>We will never forget you, Marine!<br/>Always in our hearts and prayers."<br/><span>M.Giguere of Canada</span></p>
<p>"Thanks for everything. This war will surely end soon enough. Your death will not be in vein and shall not go uncounted for. This country is thankful."<br/><span>Timothy B. Smith of Zeigler, Illinois, USA</span></p>
<p>"YOU LEFT US TO GO ON AND GUARD THE GATES OF HEAVEN. YOU FOUGHT AND WE ARE PROUD OF YOU AS YOU FACED THE ENEMY UNDER THE WORST CONDITIONS. YOUR COMMANDER ADVISED US YOUR ATTITUDE WAS ALWAYS POSITIVE AND YOUR LAUGHTER KEPT THE TROOPS MOTIVATED. WE ARE VERY PROUD. WE HAVE KNOWN THAT LAUGHTER AND POSITIVE ATTITUDE FOR MANY YEARS AND IT KEEPS US GOING NOW AND FOREVER. WE MISS YOU AND LOVE YOU. TO MY FELLOW MARINE,MY FRIEND, AND MY SON.

<p>"Brian was a great guy and will always be a great guy in our hearts. There are stories untold and so many pictures not looked at and a great loss of memorys that could have been made. Brian is my real brother we came from the same place and if i could explain he feelings and emotions, i would. I grew up with him all his life. He was always making the best out of things, like maybe he new, or he had a feeling that his time was limited. I have and will always love brian, with all my heart and soul. He excedded in everything, being a great brother, and a hero, and a great friend...................he was all around a great guy. You could always tell that everything was fine, when you saw his smile, and even if it was not, his smile told you that he could handle it.I LOVE AND MISS YOU, SHWAG"<br/><span>Shwag (Ariele) of Cedar Key, Florida</span></p>
