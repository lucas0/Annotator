                                        January 18, 1890; married in San Diego March 6, 1832, Francisca Benicia Carrillo,

<br/>
<br/>
<b><font face="Tahoma,Verdana,Trebuchet MS,Trebuchet,Geneva,Helvetica,Arial,sans"><font size="-1">Vallejo entered the military service as cadet of the Monterey company
                                    January 8, 1824. He was made Alférez (ensign) July 30, 1827; lieutenant June
                                    22, 1835; captain July 9, 1838; lieutenant-colonel of cavalry May 2, 1842. In 1838
                                    he was made comandante-general of California; and previous to that had been made
                                    comandante militar del Frontera del Norte, with headquarters at Sonoma. A commission
                                    as colonel of cavalry was sent him September 9, 1846. </font></font></b>
<br/>
<br/>
<b><font face="Tahoma,Verdana,Trebuchet MS,Trebuchet,Geneva,Helvetica,Arial,sans"><font size="-1">The life of young Vallejo at Monterey was not different from other boys
                                    of his class. With young Castro, Alvarado, Estrada, and the rest he went to school
                                    to the soldier schoolmasters and as he grew older his desire for knowledge craved
                                    other works than the lives of the saints and the doctrina Christiana. Governor Sola
                                    took much interest in the boys and helped them to obtain a few books of a more secular
                                    nature, and as they grew older they made use of their opportunities in procuring
                                    from visiting ship-masters such books as could be had which they carefully concealed
                                    from the vigilant eyes of the padres ever on guard to confiscate and destroy books
                                    of heretical tendency. </font></font></b>
<br/>
<br/>
<b><font face="Tahoma,Verdana,Trebuchet MS,Trebuchet,Geneva,Helvetica,Arial,sans"><font size="-1">In 1830 Vallejo was assigned to the San Francisco company of which he
                                    was made comandante in 1831. He made several campaigns against the Indians and in
                                    1834 was sent as comisionado to secularize the mission of <a href="http://www.steindesign.com/Max_Mission_Page/mission.html#top" target="http://www.steindesign.com/Max_Mission_Page/mission.html#top">San Francisco
                                        Solano.</a> He was a member of the territorial diputacion in 1827, and for several
                                    years thereafter, and in 1834 was granted the Petaluma rancho. </font></font>
</b>
<br/>
<br/>
<b><font face="Tahoma,Verdana,Trebuchet MS,Trebuchet,Geneva,Helvetica,Arial,sans"><font size="-1">In 1835 Vallejo was instructed to lay out a pueblo at the Solano mission,
                                    was made director of colonization at the north and was authorized to issue grants
                                    of land to settlers; the scheme being to prevent, by Spanish colonization, further
                                    extension of the Russian establishment of Ross. Vallejo laid out the pueblo and
                                    gave it the Indian name of the valley, Sonoma—Valley of the Moon. He labored
                                    very earnestly to establish his pueblo and succeeded in attracting a number of families
                                    to it. He transferred the San Francisco company to Sonoma and also organized a company
                                    of about fifty Indians whom he drilled in the manual of arms. After the neglect
                                    of the Mexican government to pay its soldiers had caused the presidial companies
                                    to disband, Vallejo supported his military establishment for several years at his
                                    own expense. In 1834 he took the preliminary steps for establishing a civil government
                                    at San Francisco and on January 1, 1835, turned over to the ayuntamiento the control
                                    of civil affairs of that pueblo. He was untiring in his efforts to settle and develop
                                    the northern frontier and through his wise management and influence with the Indian
                                    chiefs the peace of the frontier was rarely broken. In the rising of Alvarado and
                                    Castro against Gutierrez he took no active part, though his sympathies were with
                                    his nephew, Alvarado, and he accepted office under the government formed by him.
                                    He was now (1837) the foremost man in California as he was one of the richest. Over
                                    the hills of his princely estate of Petaluma roamed ten thousand cattle, four to
                                    six thousand horses, and many thousand sheep. He occupied a baronial castle on the
                                    plaza at Sonoma, where he entertained all who came with most royal hospitality and
                                    few travelers of note came to California without visiting him. At Petaluma he had
                                    a great ranch house called La Hacienda and on his home farm, Lachryma Montis (Tear
                                    of the Mountain), he built, about 1849, a modern frame house where he spent the
                                    later years of his life. </font></font></b>
<br/>
<br/>
<b><font face="Tahoma,Verdana,Trebuchet MS,Trebuchet,Geneva,Helvetica,Arial,sans"><font size="-1">Vallejo’s attitude towards the Russians at Fort Ross and Bodega was
                                    firm and dignified. He maintained that the Russians were on California soil and
                                    he notified the Russian manager, Rotchef, that while the use of the port of Bodega
                                    by the Russians was tolerated, if he permitted foreigners to land and enter the
                                    country in defiance of law he must not be surprised if he found Mexican troops stationed
                                    there. </font></font></b>
<br/>
<br/>
<b><font face="Tahoma,Verdana,Trebuchet MS,Trebuchet,Geneva,Helvetica,Arial,sans"><font size="-1">Vallejo also objected to Sutter’s establishing an independent principality
                                    in the Sacramento valley and his assumption of authority to wage war upon the natives,
                                    to grant passports, and to exercise other prerogatives of sovereignty. This made
                                    Sutter very angry and he announced that if he were interfered with he would not
                                    only defend himself but would declare the independence of California from the Mexican
                                    rule. </font></font></b>

                                    establishment of California. He had cause to be dissatisfied with the administration
                                    of Alvarado, who, giving himself up to luxurious ease and dissipation had largely
                                    left the management of affairs to the politicians that surrounded him. Juan Bautista
                                    Alvarado was a young man of excellent ability, fairly well educated for his time,
                                    of handsome person and courteous manners, and of great popularity and influence
                                    with all classes. He was born in Monterey February 14, 1809, and was son of José
                                    Francisco Alvarado and María Josefa Vallejo, and his grandfather, Juan Bautista
                                    Alvarado, was a soldier of Portolá’s expedition, 1769. Alvarado’s
                                    marriage to Doña Martina Castro, daughter of Francisco María Castro,
                                    at the mission of Santa Clara August 24, 1839, was a notable event and was attended
                                    by all the great in social and political life. Alvarado, who was then governor,
                                    was ill at Monterey and was represented by his half-brother, José Antonio
                                    Estrada, who as his proxy, stood at the altar with the bride. The governor was at
                                    this time thirty years of age, and of most distinguished appearance; but already
                                    the habit of excessive drinking was upon him and it soon became so confirmed that
                                    he was frequently unable, through “illness,” to perform his official duties.

                                    failure of what he considered necessary measures for the national defence, Vallejo
                                    wrote the supreme government in 1841 giving his opinion of Alvarado’s rule,
                                    stating his belief that the country was going to ruin, and asking to be relieved
                                    of his command. He recommended that the offices of governor and comandante-general
                                    be united in one person. Later in December of that year he pointed out to the minister
                                    of war the illness of California and suggested the remedy that should be applied.
                                    California as a country was nowhere excelled in natural advantages of climate, soil,
                                    and harbors, and it had all the elements of a grand prosperity, needing only an
                                    energetic population and wise regulations. The land was capable of every product
                                    for the welfare of a happy and prosperous people yet they imported most of the articles
                                    they consumed. A man free from ties of relationship with the people should be placed
                                    at the head of affairs and invested with both civil and military authority; a force
                                    of at least two hundred men should be sent in charge of competent officers; the
                                    fort at San Francisco should be rebuilt and, a custom-house established there; a
                                    colony of Mexican artisans and farmers should be sent to the country to counterbalance
                                    the influx of foreigners; and many other recommendations were made. </font></font>

                                    disbanded his Sonoma forces November 28, 1844, and so notified the governor, saying

                                    influence was always used for the American cause notwithstanding the treatment he
                                    received. One can hardly conceive a more ungrateful return for the kindness to immigrants

                                    possession and the United States flag was flying over his prison house. On September
                                    15, 1846, he wrote Larkin: “I left the Sacramento half dead and arrived here

<b><font face="Tahoma,Verdana,Trebuchet MS,Trebuchet,Geneva,Helvetica,Arial,sans"><font size="-1">I quote these letters because they represent the character of the man
                                    far better than any words of mine can, and how did the United States requite the
                                    services of this man? By passing laws which by their action deprived him of all
                                    his property and changed his condition from that of the richest man in California
                                    to one of comparative poverty. The land commission confirmed his grant of Rancho
                                    Nacional Soscol. The government carried it to the district-court which confirmed
                                    the action of the land commission. The government appealed the case to the supreme
                                    court which rejected the claim on the ground that the Mexican government gave away
                                    its land in California but could not sell government land for food furnished its
                                    soldiers. A most astounding decision. In 1863 Congress by special act permitted
                                    the holders of Vallejo titles to buy their land at a dollar and a quarter an acre.
                                    His great rancho of Petaluma, ten leagues, to which he added five leagues more by
                                    purchase—sixty-six thousand acres—nothing remains but the little home
                                    farm and residence, Lachryma Montis. This is the possession and home of his two
                                    youngest daughters and the spring which gives it its name supplies the town of Sonoma
                                    with water, and the daughters with a small income. The claim to the Petaluma rancho
                                    was not confirmed until 1875, after General Vallejo tired of fighting squatters
                                    and lawyers had given up his right to the land.</font></font></b>

<b><font face="Tahoma,Verdana,Trebuchet MS,Trebuchet,Geneva,Helvetica,Arial,sans"><font size="-1">On December 22, 1846, Vallejo deeded to Robert Semple an undivided half
                                    of a tract of five square miles of the Soscol rancho, on the straits of Carquines,
                                    for a new city to be built which was to be the great seaport and commercial city
                                    of the bay of San Francisco. The town was to be, named Francisca, in honor of Vallejo’s
                                    wife, Doña Francisca Benicia Carrillo. Thomas O. Larkin became interested
                                    in the venture and took over the greater part of Vallejo’s interest. The attempt
                                    to appropriate the name as well as the commercial supremacy of San Francisco was
                                    frustrated by an order of Alcalde Washington A. Bartlett requiring the name San
                                    Francisco substituted for Yerba Buena on all public documents. Doctor Semple was
                                    very indignant at this action and spluttered over it in the <i>Californian</i> which
                                    he had removed from Monterey to San Francisco. To prevent confusion the name of
                                    Francisca was changed to Benicia, the second name of Señora Vallejo. The
                                    site for the city was a beautiful one, but trade did not leave San Francisco, though
                                    General Persifer F. Smith removed the army headquarters to the city on the strait.
                                    The attempt was made to have Benicia named capital of California and General Vallejo
                                    made most generous offers to the legislature of land and money if they would move
                                    the capital thither. </font></font></b>

                                    to the work of creating a state with energy and diligence. In common with the other
                                    Californians in the convention he endeavored to protect the interests of the natives
                                    of the country. The seal of California caused much discussion. Major R. S. Garnett
                                    made a design which was accepted, but the members insisted upon the addition of
                                    various features. At last when all was agreed the bear emblem was brought forward.
                                    Some of the California members were very angry and protested against the bear being
                                    used. General Vallejo said that if the bear was put on the seal it should be represented
                                    as under the control of a vaquero with a lasso around its neck. </font></font>

                                        times during my stay in Monterey. As military commandant during the governorship
                                        of Alvarado, he exercised almost supreme sway over the country. He is a man of forty-five

                                    as General M. G. Vallejo was on board and it was necessary to give him a feast,
                                    he owning half a million acres of land, and fifty thousand head of cattle, so it
                                    was reported. He was a very gentlemanly Mexican, and quite affable to us boys, often
                                    giving us a silver dollar for pulling him on board the ship and on shore.”

                                    so peculiarly characteristic of Spanish ladies. His house is a fine one superbly

<b><font face="Tahoma,Verdana,Trebuchet MS,Trebuchet,Geneva,Helvetica,Arial,sans"><font size="-1">In common with most Californians General Vallejo was most careless and
                                    improvident when money was plenty, and while he realized large sums from the sale
                                    of lands and cattle, his later years were passed in comparative poverty. The town
                                    of Vallejo was named for him and a street in San Francisco bears his name. He, had
                                    sixteen children, of whom ten lived to maturity. One daughter married John B. Frisbie,
                                    captain of company H, Stevenson’s regiment, and another married his brother
