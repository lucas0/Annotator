<td colspan="2" width="690"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Q:</b> "I have some more information from Mr. White of State Farm and my own agent in Texas. In summary, if my shooting range is for personal use only (for example, I do not teach self-defense classes on the range), I will be covered under my homeowner's policy. State Farm has no position either way on guns; for them, any coverage related to firearms is strictly a business decision. There is no blanket prohibition at State Farm against personal, private shooting ranges. Each individual situation is assessed on a case by case basis by the underwriting agent. In my specific case, my agent welcomes the business I bring her, including my homeowner policy for the property that has the shooting range. Out of respect for Atkinson's privacy, the specifics of his account won't be discussed by State Farm, which I understand. However, at this point I retract my intention to cancel my business with State Farm. Unless Atkinson steps forward to release more details about his situation, I cannot conclude that State Farm is against gun owners per se; perhaps the only thing he needed to do was find another State Farm agent."</font></td>

But, will add that I personally sat in Renee Wilder's office on July 20th when we called another SF agent who is a shooter. I believe his name is Roe Young. He advised that there is NO way SF would cover a shooting range on my property. He told me and Renee that he would look into what options I might have. He never called me back.</font> <font color="#000099" face="Arial" size="2">Subsequent calls to SF headquarters' Mr. Ted Loy confirmed that SF would not cover shooting ranges on policy holder property. He did say that it was handled on a case by case basis. Renee Wilder went on to say that SF precludes hunting on a policy holder's land, as well, except very occasional use. Again, nothing in writing. My supervisor called his State Farm agent in West Columbia to confirm my story, as well. The answer, absolutely no shooting range, private or otherwise, on a SF policy holder's property. PERIOD. So let's cut to the chase. Anyone got a tape measure? Bring it and yourself to Chapin for a guided tour of my place. I DID NOT get that review from anyone at SF or any such offer to the effect. -Gary</font></td>

      Without speaking for State Farm, but only as an insurance agent, I can understand what has happened in this situation. If I were your insurance agent and came to your house and saw a broken front step, I would ask that you repair it. There is certainly nothing illegal with your having a broken step. It is your right as a homeowner to either repair that step or not. No one, not the local or even the federal government is going to make you repair it. BUT, your insurance company, any insurance company, will ultimately cancel your insurance if you don't fix it. Why? Simply speaking, you have a substantially increased risk of loss over folks with homes just like yours where the steps are in good repair.</font></font></td>

      I agree with all you say. I am sure every insured has an inherent degree of risk even with steps in good repair. State Farm has decided it doesn't want to insure a property where a personal range is located, shooting takes place, or hunting. Okay, fine. Maybe a great idea from a risk standpoint. Shouldn't our membership know that? Shouldn't they be given this information and the option to take their coverage to an insurance company that IS willing to insure the activity they enjoy on their property. I am not angry with State Farm - it just seems they don't want to insure properties that involve shooting activities. This definitely IS relevant and something members of an organization such as ours would want to know about.</font></font></td>

      Does having an unlicensed shooting range on a piece of property in a highly populated area increase the risk of loss? Yep, absolutely. Is it legal? Just like the step, it is (if it's over 300 feet from the nearest residence it is in Richland County. And, by the way, good journalism would dictate that YOU measure the distance before writing the article).Will any insurance company cancel your insurance for any substantial increase in potential liability loss? Yep, absolutely. And, it is in your best interest, as it is in mine as a homeowner to support this stance since our rates depend upon losses which are paid.</font></font></td>

As for your "if" situations above, I am not an insurance agent and I do not have a trained eye to look at what they are looking for. I could spend hours looking and measuring Gary's property and still a trained eye like yours would ask yet another question of me. Perhaps Renee or State Farm can give us a more detailed answer why his policy was canceled. I would look forward to publishing their statements.

If a stray shot hits and injures someone else on their own property, the fact that this individual who has done nothing illegal and was simply plinking away as he has many, many times before will probably loose everything he has--the insurance company will certainly loose the limits of the liability, and whether or not he had the "right" has absolutely nothing to do with it.</font></font></td>

      Finally, just for perspective: insurance companies require that swimming pools be fenced, will not allow homeowners to own trampolines, refuse to let you keep junked cars on your property, require that you remove discarded refrigerators, and regularly inspect homes to be sure that--horror of horrors--your home is maintained and kept in good order--none of which is required by law, or written into your policy. You can also keep a bad dog--its perfectly legal--but just as soon as your insurance company--any company--finds out, they will cancel your policy. I'm glad that they do, and so are you, but you just have never thought about it, because if the companies were not about reducing their exposure, which means that they often must "infringe on your rights as a homeowner," all of our rates would substantially higher than they are now. Any insurance company is required to do all it can to limit exposure. The states require it, the stockholders require it, and good business requires it.</font></font></td>

      The Insurance Company that Gary signed on with within the few days following notice of intent to cancel was Insurance Specifically for Ranges. Gary said he had to jump a few hurtles to qualify the range according to the group range insurance plan in accordance with NRA but that once done the Insurance was written like all the other Range Insurance plans. I am a member of Mid-Carolina Rifle Club. MCRC has similar coverage in the amount of 2,000,000. This isn't strange, just straightforward actuarial coverage for a given risk known, no doubt, to insurance companies. Call the NRA and ask about Range Insurance.

<br/>
      It is State Farm's policy not to discuss individual policyholder situations unless they have given us permission in writing to do so. State Farm Insurance has no political stance on the gun issue. We do not take issue with a person's right to own guns. We do offer insurance on guns.<br/>
      State Farm is in the business of selling insurance to protect people against the risks of everyday life. We are the nation's leading homeowners insurer because we strive to provide the best mix of coverage, service and price. In order to provide a competitive product, we have to carefully consider all risks we are undertaking when we choose to provide coverage. We recognize there are some cases that provide exposures that fall outside of typical homeownership. Liability for these cases cannot affordably be included in the cost of homeowners insurance.<br/>
