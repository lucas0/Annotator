<h5>Neoplasia Lecture Handout</h5>
<p>Jill Conway, 9/1/00</p>
<p align="justify">Neoplasia: uncontrolled new growth unresponsive to   normal growth control mechanisms like contact inhibition. Neoplasia can occur in   any cell, unlike hyperplasia which requires dividing cells. Best   official definition: "A neoplasm is an abnormal mass of tissue, the growth of   which exceeds and is uncoordinated with that of the normal tissues and persists in the   same excessive manner after cessation of the stimuli that evoked the change."[1]   This points out some of the key features of neoplasms: loss of growth control,   irreversibility, and apparent disassociation with other tissue. In advanced   metastatic cancer, the patient may appear cachexic, while tumor growth continues   unabated.</p>
<p align="justify">Classification: Benign and malignant are terms   that describe certain features of neoplasms. In general, benign tumors do not   invade or metastasize, tend to grow more slowly, have fewer abnormal mitotic figures,   and better resemble their tissue of origin than malignant ones. However, only   the existence of metastases truly distinguishes malignant tumors from benign ones.   Under a light microscope, it may not be possible to tell benign and malignant   tumors apart.</p>
<p align="justify">Differentiation: denotes the degree to which   neoplastic tissue resembles its tissue of origin both structurally and   functionally. Benign tumors tend to be well differentiated and therefore, they function as the   tissue of origin. Therefore, a benign adenoma of the thyroid will probably   secrete the thyroid hormone associated with its original cell type.</p>
<p align="justify">Malignant tumors may be well-differentiated or   totally anaplastic, which refers to "backward growth" or tissue that arises from   stem cells and fails to undergo the normal differentiation of that tissue. Anaplastic   tumors are completely undifferentiated neoplastic parenchyma. Biochemical   convergence indicates that anaplastic cells resemble other anaplastic cells more than   they do their tissue of origin. Diagnosis of tissue of origin may require   testing for presence of cellular markers.</p>
<p align="justify">As cells get more anaplastic, you will see   more:</p>
<p align="justify">pleomorphism, hyperchromasia, high N/C ratio,   increased mitotic activity with atypical mitotic figures (tripolar and quad   spindles), tumor giant cells, loss of polarity, some necrosis possible.</p>
<p align="justify">Growth rate generally increases with increasing   anaplasia.</p>
<p align="justify">Local Invasion: Benign tumors are generally well   encapsulated, surrounded by a fibrous capsule created via compression of normal   tissue as the tumor expands. </p>
<p align="justify">The capsule demarcates the tumor from the normal   tissue, making surgical removal fairly easy. In contrast, malignant tumors tend   to project into surrounding tissue (infiltration), invade it, and cause tissue   destruction. Surgical resection must always occur with a wide margin of normal   tissue to attempt to remove all the neoplastic cells. Only the presence of metastases   better distinguishes benign from malignant tumors than local   invasiveness.</p>
<p align="justify">Carcinoma in situ = presence of indicators of   malignancy in cytology (hi N/C ratio, abnormal mitotic figures, etc.) without   local invasion. Most will invade with time unless removed.</p>
<p align="justify">Development of Metastases:</p>
<p align="justify">Development of distant spread requires the ability   of a tumor cell to break free from primary tumor, invade through basement   membrane and get into the lymphatic or blood supply, enter the circulation, survive   there, enter a host tissue, anchor, establish a blood supply, and divide   excessively to form a metastatic site. Tumor cells may secrete laminin which can bridge them to the   BM, type IV collagenase to degrade the BM, elastase, or have more laminin   receptors than a normal cell, etc. </p>
<p align="justify">Millions of tumor cells may enter the circulation   each day from a primary tumor, yet few will produce secondary tumors as many   genetic alterations are necessary in combination to allow spread to occur.</p>
<p align="justify">Tumors may decrease production of E-cadherins and   integrins which are believed to help bind cells together normally and bind to   the ECM and down regulation loosens the cells from the surrounding stroma.   Normal cells express receptors that attach to BM only on one surface, whereas   cancerous ones present this receptor all over the cell, allowing it to attach more   readily to the ECM at a distant site. Ability to adhere to laminin seems to be   significant in determining the invasiveness of cells. Malignant cells often overexpress   collagenases, especially those that degrade type IV collagen of the BM.   Cathespin D breaks down many ECM components</p>
<p align="justify">(fibronectin, laminin, etc.) and seems to be   significant for prognosis of tumor aggressiveness. Most tumor cells that reach   the circulation migrate as single cells. </p>
<p align="justify">Where they attach and invade depends partially on   routes of drainage, but also on surface receptors expressed by the cell and   target organ.</p>
<p align="justify">Malignant tumors must be capable of angiogenesis   as tumors cannot grow beyond 1-2 mm without being vascularized. Angiogenic   factors may be elaborated from the tumor cells or secreted by surrounding   connective tissue. VEGF and bFGF seem to be most important and are expressed by   many tumor cells. Angiogenic factors are balanced by certain antiangiogenic   proteins, including endostatin, angiostatin, and thrombospondin-1. Most tumors   exist for years before inducing angiogenesis and growing rapidly. Normal p53 seems   to increase thrombospondin-1 (antiangiogenic) and thus decrease spread. Deletion   of both p53 alleles makes angiogenesis more likely.</p>
<p align="justify">Benign tumors never metastasize and therefore, any   tumor with distant mets is by definition cancerous. 30% of those diagnosed with   solid tumor ca already have metastasis. Spread occurs via direct seeding of   body cavities (ovarian ca and peritoneum), spread through blood or lymphatic   channels. </p>
<p align="justify">Hematogenous Spread: typical of sarcomas, usually   occurs through veins. Tumor expansions typically follow the route of venous   drainage, meaning that liver and lungs are frequent sites of   metastasis.</p>
<p align="justify">Lymphatic Spread: typical of carcinomas, usually   follows patterns of drainage</p>
<h6 align="justify">SUMMARY OF BENIGN/MALIGNANT FEATURES: </h6>
<p align="justify">Most benign tumors grow slowly and are   encapsulated, and show fewer atypical cells. Most are well differentiated and   show no signs of local invasion. Benign tumors do not metastasize. </p>
<p align="justify">Most malignant tumors invade, are not   encapsulated, grow quickly, are capable of angiogenesis, and metastasize.   Malignant tumors may be well-differentiated or anaplastic and usually show lots of cellular   atypia with hi N/C ratios, hyperchromasia, abnormal mitotic figures.</p>
<p align="justify">Nomenclature:</p>
<p align="justify">Benign neoplasms are named with the suffix -oma,   such as a leiomyoma (fibroid) in the uterus. Adenomas refer to benign tumors of   epithelial origin that resemble glandular structures, or those tumors derived from   glands. Papillomas project with finger like areas raised from an epithelial   surface. Polyps are benign, macroscopically visible projections from a mucosal   surface.</p>
<p align="justify">Malignant tumors are named with the suffix   -carcinoma for those of epithelial cell origin, and -sarcoma for those derived   from mesenchymal tissue. </p>
<p align="justify">Note exceptions to nomenclature: teratoma (benign   or malignant), hepatoma, seminoma (testis), and melanoma are all malignant,   whereas hamartoma=benign proliferations of normal tissue in an   organ Adenocarcinoma: these arise from glandular tissue   or resemble glandular tissue Carcinoma: malignant tumor arising from epithelial   origin, tends to spread via lymphatics. Those that resemble glands are called   adenocarcinomas, and those with visible squamous cells are called squamous cell   carcinomas.</p>
<p align="justify">Sarcoma: malignant neoplasm arising from   mesenchyme, tends to spread hematogenously (especially to liver and lungs since   most often invades into venous drainage and these organs are exposed to most   venous drainage).</p>
<p align="justify">Most tumors are originally monoclonal, deriving   from one cell line. Exceptions include pleomorphic adenomas, such as the mixed   tumor of salivary gland origin, that includes components derived from two different   cell lines (epithelial and myoepithelial). Teratomas include cell types of more   than one germ cell line, usually all three and usually arise in germ cell tissue such as   testis and ovary.</p>
<p align="justify">Classification of Malignant Tumors: grading and   staging</p>

<p align="justify">Epidemiology of Cancer:</p>
<p align="justify">In the USA, about one in five will die from cancer   with an estimated 564,000 in 1998. This accounts for 23% of mortality, second   only to cardiovascular disease.[2]</p>
<p align="justify">The major cause of death from cancer in men and   women is from lung cancer, although breast ca is more common in women and   prostate ca is more common in men than lung ca.</p>
<p align="justify">About 90% of ca may be related to environment and   lifestyle.</p>
<p align="justify">Risk factors for developing various forms of   cancer include advancing age, certain inherited mutations, familial   dispositions, smoking, and alcohol intake.</p>
<p align="justify">Heredity: Predispositions to cancer may be   inherited in an autosomal dominant or recessive fashion. Dominant patterns of   inheritance involve presence of a single mutant gene that greatly increases risk of ca such   as familial retinoblastoma or familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP).</p>
<p align="justify">Familial cancers are those that clearly occur in   familial clusters but do not have a confirmed genetic heritable basis and they   include breast cancer and colon cancer other than those of FAP. </p>
<p align="justify">Autosomal recessive defects in repair of DNA   predisposes to the development of certain cancers such as xeroderma   pigmentosum.</p>
<p align="justify">In addition, acquired "precancerous" conditions   such as hyperplastic nodules in cirrhotic liver, bronchial metaplasia from   cigarette smoke, ulcerative colitis, certain benign neoplasms, and many other conditions   provide an environment in which cancer arises more frequently than in healthy   tissue.</p>
<h6 align="justify">MOLECULAR BASIS OF CANCER</h6>
<p align="justify">Basic Principles:</p>
<p align="justify">Cancer arises from nonlethal genetic damage which   can be transmitted to cell progeny. Most tumors initially develop as monoclonal,   arising from a single mutated cell.</p>
<p align="justify">Three kinds of genes are targets for carcinogenic   transformation:</p>
<div align="justify">
<ol>
<li>proto-oncogenes promote cell growth and require   the alteration of only one allele to create out of control cellular growth   (dominant gene)</li>
<li>tumor suppressor genes inhibit cell growth and   require the alteration of both alleles to affect cell growth (recessive   oncogenes), DNA repair genes are similar</li>
<li>genes that regulate apoptosis may be dominant   or recessive but influence the ability of the cell to target itself for   destruction following cell damage</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p align="justify">Tumor progression refers to the ability of   transformed cells to acquire further abnormal characteristics over time,   independent of tumor size. These include ability to invade, metastatic spread, further anaplasia.   It is believed that these characteristics are acquired through mutations within   the tumor leading to subgroups of cells with varying characteristics. At the time of   diagnosis, most tumors are heterogenous and have multiple cell lines present.   The absence of p53 in many human tumors may contribute to the increased instability   of DNA in tumors.</p>
<h6 align="justify">ONCOGENES</h6>
<p align="justify">Proto-oncogenes are normal cellular genes that   regulate cell growth, division, and differentiation. Oncogenes are   cancer-causing genes derived from proto-oncogenes by mutation, retroviral   transduction, gene amplification, or dislocations. Oncogenes occur as   transformations of genes that normally regulate expression of growth factors and receptors, signal   transducing proteins, nuclear transcriptions factors, and cyclins and their   associated proteins.</p>
<p align="justify">Classes of Oncogenes:</p>
<p align="justify">Growth Factors: Genes that encode growth factors   may become oncogenic. For example, cells that produce PDGF may also develop   receptors for it and become permanently turned on via autocrine   stimulation. Usually, the PDGF gene (sis) is normal, but oncogenes such as ras   cause PDGF to be overexpressed. </p>
<p align="justify">Excess growth factor itself cannot completely   transform a cell, but in conditions of excessive growth and cell division, other   mutations become more likely.</p>
<p align="justify">Growth Factor Receptors: most are transmembrane   proteins that cause phosphorylation of proteins on the cytoplasmic side when   activated. Normally, the cytoplasmic side gets transiently turned "on" and   then rapidly deactivated. Oncogenic receptors exist in a prolonged "on" state,   even in the absence of bound growth factor. Point mutations in the ret protooncogene   (codes for receptor associated with glial cells) are associated with MEN and   familial medullary thyroid carcinoma. </p>
<p align="justify">Growth factor receptors may also be overexpressed.   c-erb1 codes for an EGF receptor overexpressed in many squamous cell cas, and   c-erb 2 in the adenocas of the breast, ovary, lung and others.</p>
<p align="justify">Signal Transducing Proteins: these proteins exist   on the inner plasma membrane and following activation work to phosphorylate   cytoplasmic proteins. Ras, a GTP cleaving protein receptor associated   transducing protein, is the prototype and mutated versions of the ras proteins   are present in 10-20% of human cancers. </p>
<p align="justify">The normal GTPase activity of ras protein is   accelerated when in association with GAPs (GTPase-activating proteins). Ras   normally works to activate MAP (mitogen activated protein) kinase that increase   nuclear transcription factors. Mutated forms of ras bind GAP normally, but the   GTPase activity of GAP fails to occur. </p>
<p align="justify">Translocation of the signal transducing protein   (non-receptor associated) c-abl on chromosome 9 to the bcr region of chromosome   22 activates it to increase cell growth. This translocation is associated with   CML.</p>
<p align="justify">Nuclear Transcription Proteins: these proteins   influence DNA synthesis in the nucleus. C-myc, forms a heterodimer with max   protein, and the myc-max combination activates transcription. Mad, a   similar protein to myc, may also combine with max to turn off transcription and   is therefore a tumor-suppressor gene.</p>
<p align="justify">Cyclins and CDKs: CDKs are present within the cell   at all times and help the cell through the cell cycle. Cyclins are synthesized   and then rapidly degraded and work to activate the CDKs. CDKIs regulate the   activity of CDKs. CDK4 mutation seems to be implicated in melanomas and other   cancers.</p>
<p align="justify">Methods of Activation of Oncogenes:</p>
<div align="justify">
<ol>
<li>Point mutations: typical ofras proteins </li>
<li>Chromosomal rearrangements: translocation may   associate a growth factor or receptor with an actively transcribed area, or   result in the formation of an active hybrid protein. EX: philly chromosome c-abl-bcr   has hybrid activity</li>
<li> Gene Amplification: duplication, multiplication   of DNA sequences in the genome. Associated with N-myc in neuroblastoma and c-erb   2 in breast ca.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p align="justify">Tumor Suppressor Genes</p>
<p align="justify">Tumor suppressor genes are normal cell genes that   "brake" cell division and cycling at various point in the cell cycle. They work   through similar mechanisms to proto-oncogenes, through signal transduction,   through cell surface receptors and nuclear transcription regulators.</p>
<p align="justify">Suppressor genes are "recessive" and require loss   of both copies of the normal before cancer becomes likely, the "two-hit" model   of carcinogenesis. </p>
<p align="justify">Retinoblastoma models this behavior and exists as   60% sporadic and 40% familial, but occurs much earlier if familial. The theory   is that both alleles of Rb must be ineffective before tumor suppression is lost. In   the familial forms, all somatic cells have inherited one defective allele, and   only one cell must lose its other allele to become predisposed to produce tumors. pRb works to   prevent cells in G1 from advancing to S phase. This is an extremely sensitive   transition since no further growth factors are required to complete mitosis   following progression into S phase. pRb normally exists in an active,   hypophosphorylated state and when phosphorylated, it releases the brakes and allows   cell division to progress. Most likely, Rb forms tumors in the retina and   osteosarcoma because deletion of both active alleles should trigger apoptosis. But, for   reasons not fully understood, retinoblasts fail to die following   transformation. p53, a protein exclusive to the nucleus, is the   most common transformed gene in human cancer, presenting in over 50% of human   tumors. p53, designated "guardian of the genome," acts in the nucleus to stop   replication of damaged cells. Following damage, p53 gets rapidly up regulated   and its accumulation triggers increased transcription of DNA repair proteins and those   that stop the cell cycle. If repair occurs, the cell cycle resumes. If not, p53   plays a role in triggering apoptosis. Loss of both normal alleles of p53 causes the cell   cycle to continue with the mistakes in DNA transcription intact. p73 has recently been discovered and appears to   work by similar mechanisms.</p>
<p align="justify">Other tumor suppressor genes include NF-1, NF-2,   VHL, and WT-1.</p>
<p align="justify">Suppressors of apoptosis involved in ca include   bcl-2 , which inhibits apoptosis and is transformed in most B cell lymphomas.   Growth arises from decreased cell death rather than increased cell proliferation.   The bax and bad gene accelerates cell death and opposes bcl-2.</p>
<p align="justify">Defective DNA repair genes are implicated in the   development of cancers as they may allow cell division despite mutated DNA.   HNPCC (hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer) illustrates a cancer   associated with defects in DNA repair. These genes are not considered oncogenic   but favor conditions that allow mutations in normal oncogenes. XP also arises from   defects in DNA repair genes.</p>
<h6 align="justify">CARCINOGENESIS:</h6>
<p align="justify">Carcinogenesis is a multi-step process and may   involve mutations in growth promoting proto-oncogenes, and growth-inhibiting   cancer suppressor genes (anti-oncogenes) and the genes that regulate   apoptosis. Every human cancer studied shows loss of two or more antioncogenes   and activation of several oncogenes. </p>
<p align="justify">No single mutation is sufficient for malignant   transformation. The sequence in which mutations are acquired seems to affect the   potential malignancy of a cell.</p>
<p align="justify">Tumor cells may cycle continuously, but the time   it takes them to divide is not any faster than that of normal cells. Growth   fraction, the % of cells in a given pool currently replicating may be much higher than in   normal tissue. However, even in the fastest growing tumors, most cells are   resting in G0 and only about 20% are involved in replication. Cell production must   outpace cell loss for the tumor to grow. Growth fraction must be high for most   chemotherapeutic agents to be effective.</p>
<p align="justify">Tumors are clinically evident only after about 30   population doublings or about 1 gm of tumor with about 109 cells present. By   this time, many of the tumor cells have stopped cycling. However, although it may   take years to reach clinical detectability, rapidly growing tumors may double in   size with 2-3 months.</p>
<p align="justify">Chemical Carcinogenesis: </p>
<p align="justify">Initiator=carcinogenic agent that changes DNA   irreversibly, with a change that can be passed on to cell progeny. Promoter can   produce a tumor in previously initiated cells only and is reversible.</p>
<p align="justify">Many carcinogens must be activated first   (procarcinogen -&gt; ultimate carcinogen). This process often occurs with the   P450 liver oxygenase system.</p>
<p align="justify">Initiators include alkylating agents, polycyclic   aromatic hydrocarbons, B-napththylamine, aflatoxin B1, nitrate,   asbestos.</p>
<p align="justify">Promoters include agents such as hormones that   encourage cell division.</p>
<p align="justify">Radiation: Exposure to UV light, especially UVB,   increases the risk of basal cell ca, squamous cell ca, and maybe melanoma. UV   light increases the formation of pyrimidine dimers in DNA which often gets repaired   by DNA repair mechanisms. Xeroderma pigmentosum, a hereditary dysfunction of the   nucleotide excision repair pathway, results in a much increased risk   of skin cancer. UVB may also cause mutations in oncogenes and tumor suppressor   genes.</p>
<p align="justify">Ionizing radiation predisposes to the development   of certain kinds of cancer, especially leukemias and thyroid cancers (in the   young). Following a long latency period, survivors of atomic bomb fallout have also   developed increased incidence of breast, colon, and lung cancers.</p>
<p align="justify">Viral Oncogenensis:</p>
<p align="justify">DNA viruses: These viruses integrate into cellular   DNA and in doing so, interrupt the sequence necessary for viral replication.   Viral genes normally expressed early in the replication process play a role in   transforming cells.</p>
<p align="justify">Associations between viruses and human cancers   include the following:</p>
<p align="justify">HPV (especially 16, 18, and 31) and cervical ca.   HPV 6 and 11 are *not* associated with the development of cancer.</p>
<p align="justify">EBV is present in 100% of nasopharyngeal ca, 90%   of African Burkitt's lymphoma, some B cell lymphomas, especially those in HIV   infected or otherwise immunosuppressed patients. EBV infection   immortalizes B cells.</p>
<p align="justify">HBV and hepatocellular ca. HBV causes chronic   liver insult and therefore increased numbers of dividing hepatocytes. HBV codes   for Hbx protein which may interfere with p53 function.</p>
<p align="justify">RNA viruses:</p>
<p align="justify">All are retroviruses and only HTLV-1 causes a   human tumor. HTLV-1 infects CD4+ cells preferentially and may lead to leukemia   after many years via stimulating T-cell replication.</p>
<p align="justify">Microbes: H. pylori may be implicated in the   development with gastric B-cell lymphomas. </p>
<p align="justify">Host defenses </p>
<p align="justify">TSA=tumor specific antigens cause an immune   response and are present only on tumor cells. These may activate a cytotoxic   T-cell response through presentation by class I MHC molecules. Some tumor-specific   shared antigens have been identified that are silent in all normal adult tissue   but may be expressed on tumor cells. </p>
<p align="justify">For example, MAGE proteins are present only in the   adult testis, but are not expressed on the cell surface. Various MAGE proteins   are associated with a number of cancers, including lung cas and   melanoma.</p>
<p align="justify">TAA=tumor associated antigens may be on tumor and   normal cells so do not cause an immune response but can help diagnosis or   treatment of existing neoplasms. </p>
<p align="justify">For example, PSA levels may indicate extent of   prostate cancer, AFP may be expressed by liver and testicular cancers, and CEA   is expressed by many colorectal,pancreatic, gastric, and breast cas.</p>
<p align="justify">NK cells are lymphocytes (non-T, non-B) that can   destroy tumor cells without being sensitized first, upon activation by IL-2.   Considered the first line of defense against most tumors. They also participate in   ADCC, where they can bind the Fc portion of IgG attached to cells and lyse them. </p>
<p align="justify">Cytotoxic T cells (antibody dependent) can be   sensitized specifically to attack neoplastic cells (this happens especially in   HPV induced cancers). </p>
<p align="justify">Macrophages can attack tumor cells when activated   by IFN-gamma released by T cells. Macrophages secrete TNF-alpha. </p>
<p align="justify">It is not clear exactly how this works, although   the number of cas (especially lymphomas) in immunosuppressed patients would seem   to indicate that immunosurveillance normally occurs.</p>
<p align="justify">Cachexia is seen in advanced ca and includes body   wasting, weakness, anorexia, and anemia. It is *not* caused by the tumor's   nutritional needs, although the larger the tumor, the worse it is. Both fat and   protein are consumed equally. Cause unknown, but some relation to TNF-alpha and   perhaps to a newly isolated protein-mobilizing factor, which, when injected   into healthy mice causes rapid weight loss despite maintenance of caloric   intake.</p>
<p align="justify">Paraneoplastic syndromes: this includes many signs   and symptoms that arise from sources other than local tumor effects,   consequences from distant mets, or production of hormones native to the tissue of   origin. These syndromes include endocrinopathies from ectopic hormone   production, in which tumor cells secrete excessive quantities of endocrine hormones. Small   cell ca of the lung is often associated with elaboration of ACTH. Hypercalcemia   arises from either osteolysis by primary tumors or production of PTHrP that may act   as PTH at various sites. Hypercalcemia is especially associated with carcinomas   of breast, kidney, ovary, and squamous cell ca of the lung. DIC, migratory   thrombophlebitis, neuromyopathies are also associated with various forms of   advanced cancer.</p>
