<p></p>
<p>
<b>CNN'S WOLF <b>BLITZER</b></b>:  Mr. Vice President, thanks for joining us on Late
Edition. 
</p>
<p>
<b>VICE PRESIDENT AL <b>GORE</b></b>:  Glad to do it. 
  
</p>
<p>
<b>BLITZER</b>:  You're going to be going to Iowa and New Hampshire
in the coming days.  Less than a year from now, we probably will
know who the Democratic nominee is, who the Republican nominee
is for the president.  Why do you want to be president? 
</p>
<p>
<b>GORE</b>:  Well, Wolf, I haven't formally announced my candidacy
yet, but when I do, I will lay out a vision of what I want to
see in this country in the 21st century.  And the campaign won't
be about me, it'll be about the American people, and I hope
they'll choose that vision of a nation with strong families and
livable communities, in harmony with all of our diversity and
fully prepared to lead the world. 
</p>
<p>
<b>BLITZER</b>:  You've created an exploratory committee, though.
When do you make the formal announcement?  It's not going to
be... 
</p>
<p>
<b>GORE</b>:  Later this year. 
  
</p>
<p>
<b>BLITZER</b>:  It's not going to be a surprise. 
  
</p>
<p>
<b>GORE</b>:  Well, perhaps not.  But it won't come until later this
year. 
</p>
<p>
<b>BLITZER</b>:  When? 
  
</p>
<p>
<b>GORE</b>:  Haven't picked a date. 
  
</p>
<p>
<b>BLITZER</b>:  Are you looking at some precedents, some previous
examples?  When Vice President Bush, for example, made his
announcement? 
</p>
<p>
<b>GORE</b>:  No, I won't base it on previous campaigns, I'll just
look at see what seems like the right time. 
</p>
<p>
<b>BLITZER</b>:  Some people have suggested that you will try to
emerge from Bill Clinton's shadow during the course of the
coming year. Others say you don't want to emerge from his
shadow.  The question to you is, do you want to emerge from the
president's shadow? 
</p>
<p>
<b>GORE</b>:  Well, I don't feel like I'm in his shadow.  I think
the job of vice president is very different and very distinct
from the job of president.  And for the last 6 years-plus, I've
concentrated on doing the best job I can as vice president to
help he be the best president he can be.  And I've really
enjoyed that.  It's been a great privilege and honor, but as a
presidential candidate -- when I become one -- I will be in a
very different relationship to the American people.  And at that
time, I'll be speaking about my vision for what I want to see in
this country in the 21st century. 
</p>
<p>
   And I'm looking forward to that.  I'm very excited about the
chance. 
</p>
<p>
<b>BLITZER</b>:  And the Al <b>GORE</b> vision will not be necessarily
completely the same as the Bill Clinton? 
</p>
<p>
<b>GORE</b>:  Well, no, because the challenges we face in the future
are different from the ones we face in the past.  I have been
very much involved in shaping our current economic policies, and
I feel as if I know a great deal about how to keep our
prosperity going. 
</p>
<p>
   We have a governing coalition willing to support the ideas
that work for the American people.  I have also participated in
shaping our environmental and education and crime fighting
policies and other initiatives, but the challenges are going to
be brand new. 
</p>
<p>
   You know, the 21st century is not only the beginning of a new
millennium, it's the beginning of an entirely new era in human
history and we have to take new approaches. 
</p>
<p>
<b>BLITZER</b>:  I want to get to some of the substance of domestic
and international issues in a minute, but let's just wrap up a
little bit of the politics right now. 
</p>
<p>
   Why should Democrats, looking at the Democratic nomination
process, support you instead of Bill Bradley, a friend of yours,
a former colleague in the Senate?  What do you have to bring to
this that he doesn't necessarily bring to this process? 
</p>
<p>
<b>GORE</b>:  Well, I will be offering -- I'll be offering my vision
when my campaign begins.   And it will be comprehensive and
sweeping. And I hope that it will be compelling enough to draw
people toward it. I feel that it will be. 
</p>
<p>
   But it will emerge from my dialogue with the American people.
I've traveled to every part of this country during the last six
years. During my service in the United States Congress, I took
the initiative in creating the Internet.          I took the
initiative in moving forward a whole range of initiatives that
have proven to be important to our country's economic growth and
environmental protection, improvements in our educational
system. 
</p>
<p>
   During a quarter century of public service, including most of
it long before I came into my current job, I have worked to try
to improve the quality of life in our country and in our world.
And what I've seen during that experience is an emerging future
that's very exciting, about which I'm very optimistic, and
toward which I want to lead. 
</p>
<p>
<b>BLITZER</b>:  On this political front, the polls currently see
Governor George Bush of Texas and even Elizabeth Dole ahead of
you in a hypothetical race nearly two years away from today.
Why do you think that's the situation? 
</p>
<p>
<b>GORE</b>:  Well, what will decide the outcome of the presidential
contest in the year 2000 will not be public opinion polls but
the power of ideas, the quality of leadership, the compelling
vision that I will offer for the American people and how they
respond to it.  It won't be decided by public opinion polls.

</p>
<p>
<b>BLITZER</b>:  Although there is one poll that recently came out
that did show 45 percent of the voters, 45 percent of the
American people, say they've already ruled out voting for you. 
</p>
<p>
<b>GORE</b>:  Well, you know, in -- a few decades ago, IBM predicted
that the total market worldwide for computers would be a few
dozen. Those predictions turned out to be wrong.  Other
predictions of the future have been famously wrong because they
didn't take into account what the reality is. 
</p>
<p>
   And polls are simply predictions of the future, in this case
of an election that's two years away.  And you know the old
saying that six months is a lifetime in politics.  That means
there are four lifetimes between now and then. 
</p>
<p>
   And once again, polls will not determine the outcome in any
way, shape or form.  Ideas will.  The compelling vision offered
by -- when I become a candidate later this year and when that
dialogue with the American people begins, their decision will be
based not on polls. 
</p>
<p>
<b>BLITZER</b>:  You know, several of your potential Republican
challengers, including former Vice President Dan Quayle, have
slammed you for saying on that day that the president was
impeached that Bill Clinton will go down as one of America's
greatest presidents.  Do you still feel that way, knowing today
what you knew then? 
</p>
<p>
<b>GORE</b>:  Well, look at what this administration has done.  We
went from the largest budget deficit in history to the largest
budget surplus in history.  We went from a period of high
unemployment and high inflation to high employment and
historically low unemployment and virtually zero inflation. 
</p>
<p>
   The last economic report came out with six percent growth and
virtually zero inflation; 18 million new jobs; improved reading
test scores for our children; a six-year drop in the crime rate,
continuing to decline; a cleaner environment; a new feeling on
the part of all of our people that we do have the capacity to
make our democracy work for our future and to solve our
problems. 
</p>
<p>
   We are steadily gaining in our ability to reclaim control of
America's destiny.  That's what we're intended to do as
Americans. Now this has all happened in the last six years.  And
incidentally, it happened when we changed course.  I had the
privilege of breaking the tie vote, and there were zero
Republican votes for the new plan that's produced -- even though
in the country, Republicans, Independents, Democrats, they all
supported the changes that we've brought about. 
</p>
<p>
<b>BLITZER</b>:  So even though the president was impeached, and by
his own admission did engage in reckless conduct with an intern
here at the White House, you still stand by that basic
statement, he will go down as one of America's greatest presidents?

</p>
<p>
<b>GORE</b>:  The Bible says by your fruits, ye shall know them.
And the fruits of this administration's success are known by the
American people to be good for our country.  The policies have
been tremendously successful. 
</p>
<p>
   Now we need to continue our prosperity and use the prosperity
to move our country forward and upward, and to make our country
not only better off, but better. 
</p>
<p>
<b>BLITZER</b>:  Is there any specific strategy you plan on engaging
in during the campaign to deal with this issue -- the
impeachment issue, the scandal issue, the impact, potential
spillover effect on you from the president's behavior? 
</p>
<p>
<b>GORE</b>:  Well, Wolf, what the president did was terribly wrong.
 It was indefensible.  He's apologized for it.  And you know
what the American people want?  They want us to move on.  They
want us to focus on the future and talk about them and work on
their problems and build their future, not wallow in the past. 
</p>
<p>
<b>BLITZER</b>:  That sounds like a strategy that you will have to
work on.  Trent Lott, the Senate majority leader, Dennis
Hastert, the speaker of the House, are refusing at this point to
say they trust the president and to engage in the kind of kind
of bipartisan cooperation necessary to move on on issues like
education, Social Security, Medicare.  Is there any window of
opportunity now to get some of these programs off the ground?
Or is there going to be deadlock, gridlock right now for the
foreseeable future? 
</p>
<p>
<b>GORE</b>:  Well, the American people are in charge of our self-
government, not the Republican leaders of the Congress.  They
have an argument among themselves, and the American people have
been puzzled as to why they won't focus on the people's
business.  I hope and expect that eventually they will, because
there is a rising demand from the American people that
politicians in both political parties work together and stop
fighting ideological battles that are sometimes beside the
point.  Where the nation's business is concerned, they want us
to make progress, keep the prosperity going and solve the
problems. 
</p>
<p>
<b>BLITZER</b>:  But there are some philosophical differences.  On
the education issue, the Republicans want local communities to
be in control.  They accuse the Democrats and you of wanting the
federal government in Washington to dictate ... 
</p>
<p>
<b>GORE</b>:  No, no. 
  
</p>
<p>
<b>BLITZER</b>:  ... to local school districts the kind of education
policy they should be using. 
</p>
<p>
<b>GORE</b>:  No, no.  We want ... 
  
</p>
<p>
<b>BLITZER</b>:  And there's a deadlock today in the Senate on this
specific issue. 
</p>
<p>
<b>GORE</b>:  We want accountability, and we want to measure the
results so that we are moving in the right direction.  And let's
take that amendment that is pending today.  We know how to
improve our schools. The single most important thing we can do
is to have fewer students in each classroom, more well-trained
teachers, so that each teacher will have more time to spend
individually with each student. 
</p>
<p>
   You can think back in your own upbringing, I can, and
remember the teachers who made a difference.  And always, it was
the one who had more time to spend with you, who connected and
who understood that you learned in a slightly different way from
any other child.  Because every child is that way. 
</p>
<p>
   How do we create that kind of extra time for teachers to do
what they do best and give them the training?  Well, the answer
is about hiring more teachers and giving them the best training
in the world. 
</p>
<p>
   Let me draw a comparison to what we did in fighting crime.
We said we need more community police officers.  And so we
finally convinced the Congress to pass a law that hired 100,000
new community police officers, greatly expanded the size of the
force around the country, and then deployed them on the
sidewalks, not in squad cars, where they could develop
one-on-one relationships. 
</p>
<p>
   What's happened as a result?  The crime rate has dropped in
every category for six years in a row. 
</p>
<p>
   We know how to solve this problem in the same way we know how
to bring about improvement in our schools.  Let's hire 100,000
new teachers, give them the training they need, and reduce the
class size in the early grades.  That's the amendment that's
pending.  Senator Murray and Senator Kennedy are pushing it
forward.  The Republican leaders are trying to block it. 
</p>
<p>
   The Republicans out in the country are the same as the
Democrats and Independents out in the country.  They want to see
these improvements.  They don't want a fight on false
ideological boundaries where the real issue is how do we solve
the problem. 
</p>
<p>
<b>BLITZER</b>:  Let's move on to a key international issue on your
agenda today, namely the situation with China.  China's been
accused of human rights abuses.  It's been accused of engaging
in unfair trade practices, a record trade deficit with the
United States.  It has made bellicose statements against Taiwan
in recent days, threatening Taiwan.  And now there are
allegations that the Clinton administration under your watch,
that the administration was negligent in dealing with an
allegation of espionage of nuclear secrets at the Los Alamos
nuclear facility, research facility. 
</p>
<p>
   Do you continue to engage in your policy, as you call it,
"constructive engagement" with China, in the midst of all of
these allegations? 
</p>
<p>
<b>GORE</b>:  Well, first of all on the law enforcement matter that
you raise, please keep in mind, that happened during the
previous administration.  That happened back in the 1980s.  And
as soon as the investigation identified targets of that
investigation, then the law enforcement community handled that
very aggressively, and it resulted in a presidential directive
that completely changed the security procedures in the weapons
labs.  And as far as the law enforcement aspects of that are
concerned, you have to go to the appropriate agencies. 
</p>
<p>
<b>BLITZER</b>:  But you heard Senator Lott and Senator Shelby say
over the weekend that this administration was negligent... 
</p>
<p>
<b>GORE</b>:  Well... 
  
</p>
<p>
<b>BLITZER</b>:  ... was lax in dealing with the threat that some
people thought really existed at that time because of the
overall need to engage China. 
</p>
<p>
<b>GORE</b>:  Again, this happened in the previous administration,
and the law enforcement agencies have pressed it and pursued it
aggressively with our full support.  And in the course of this,
what developed was a brand new presidential directive that fixed
problems that we had inherited and changed and vastly improved
the security procedures in the national laboratory system. 
</p>
<p>
<b>BLITZER</b>:  As you look to these allegations, do you continue
this engagement policy with China, or do you pause and reassess
where the United States should be going with China? 
</p>
<p>
<b>GORE</b>:  Well, China is the most populous country in the world.
Its economy is growing, and its role in the world is going to
continue to grow whether we want that or not.  And so,
obviously, having a relationship with them within which we can
try to affect their behavior and improve human rights, eliminate
unfair trade practices, and bring about the kinds of changes
that will lead to further democratization in China, these things
are in our interest.  We do that without compromising our
principles in any way; indeed, by enhancing our ability to speak
out on behalf of human rights and more freedom in China. 
</p>
<p>
   We have seen now 10,000 local democratic elections in China.
We've seen a slow progress towards elections at the next highest
level, the county level, it would be seen in our system.  And we
have also seen some movement toward more reporting and more
press activity inside China. 
</p>
<p>
   That kind of thing can build upon itself and bring greater
reforms.  But we're very concerned about some of the practices
of China, and we've made that clear to them.  We will continue
to make it clear to them. 
</p>
<p>
<b>BLITZER</b>:  I know you have to go, but a quick question on your
becoming soon a grandfather. 
</p>
<p>
   (LAUGHTER) 
  
</p>
<p>
   Is this going to change your life? 
  
</p>
<p>
<b>GORE</b>:  Tipper and I are so excited.  It's hard to find the
words for the thrilling feeling it gives you to think that
you're going to be a grandparent for the first time.  We're
expecting our first grandchild this summer, and we can hardly
wait. 
</p>
<p>
<b>BLITZER</b>:  Are looking to some other grandfathers for
grandfatherly advice? 
</p>
<p>
<b>GORE</b>:  Well, that's not a bad -- everybody tells me that it's
even better than having children, and I'm looking forward to
finding out for myself. 
</p>
<p>
<b>BLITZER</b>:  You get the benefits without the pain. 
  
</p>
<p>
<b>GORE</b>:  Well, I must say, I remember seeing my parents and
Tipper's parents fawn over their grandchildren in a way that I
never experienced when I was their age, and I think everybody
gets a kick out of that.  I'm looking forward to experiencing it
from the standpoint of the grandparent, and that'll be later
this year in the summer. 
</p>
<p>
<b>BLITZER</b>:  Well, good luck to the grandparents and the
parents. 
</p>
<p>
<b>GORE</b>:  Thank you. 
  
</p>
<p>
<b>BLITZER</b>:  Thank you, Mr. Vice President, for joining us on
Late Edition. 
</p>
<p>
<b>GORE</b>:  Thank you, Wolf. 
  
</p>
<p>
<b>BLITZER</b>:  Thank you.
