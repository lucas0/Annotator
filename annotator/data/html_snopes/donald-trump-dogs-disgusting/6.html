Elite Daily reached out to the White House for comment on the claims, but did not hear back. However, Trump denied all of the claims made by Manigault in a series of tweets on August 13 calling his former aide "wacky," "vicious," "not smart," and a "low life" — and then took it one step further and<a class="" href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1029329583672307712" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> called Manigault a dog</a>. </p><p>While of course calling someone a dog is a terrible thing to do in any situation, apparently it's actually the worst insult Trump has in his arsenal, according to <em>The Washington Post. </em>Sources who have observed Trump for a while told the publication on Tuesday that calling Manigault "that dog" shows how angry he is because he has "<a class="" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/he-created-omarosa-how-trumps-protege-turned-his-tactics-against-him/2018/08/14/53d2c8f0-9fcd-11e8-83d2-70203b8d7b44_story.html?utm_term=.31ed5694acc3" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">an aversion to dogs and other pets</a>."

Even better? He used a former furry White House resident — Bo Obama (Bobama?).</p><p>On August 14 Souza tweeted a photo of Bo sitting in a White House doorway, staring at Obama as the president walks through the door. "A real dog waiting for a real President." wrote Souza. <em>Burn. </em></p><div class="gZ"><div class="lK"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-tweetid="1029378225347149825"><a href="https://twitter.com/PeteSouza/status/1029378225347149825"></a></blockquote></div></div><p>Souza has become famous for his super clever trolling of Trump ever since the 2016 campaign trail, and I have to say that this ranks up there with the best of them. The tweet came right after Trump had blasted Omarosa over the claims in her book, denying all the allegations and calling her names.  It's even better now that we know Trump is not a fan of the doggos. </p><p>With everything else going on in the White House, most of us probably haven't noticed that there's no furry friend running around the Oval Office. But now that I know the reason is because Trump just reportedly hates pets, well I just can't unsee it. </p></div></div><div class="hj"><div class="hk"><div class="i"></div></div></div></article><div class="cN"></div></div><div class="l"><input class="o" id="navCheckbox" type="checkbox"/><nav class="m"><div class="p"><label class="z" for="navCheckbox"><button aria-label="close" class="A"></button></label><ul class="r"><li class="y"><form action="/search" autocapitalize="" autocomplete="" class="gL gN" target="_top"><input aria-label="Search Elite Daily" class="gM" name="q" placeholder="search..." type="search" value=""/></form></li><li><a href="https://www.elitedaily.com/news">News</a></li><li><a href="https://www.elitedaily.com/experiences">Experiences</a></li><li><a href="https://www.elitedaily.com/style">Style</a></li><li><a href="https://www.elitedaily.com/entertainment">Entertainment</a></li><li><a href="https://www.elitedaily.com/dating">Dating</a></li><li><a href="https://www.elitedaily.com/video">Video</a></li></ul><ul class="q"><li class="w"><a class="x" href="https://www.elitedaily.com/"></a></li><li><div class="v"><a class="cU" href="https://www.facebook.com/EliteDaily/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><i class="cW"></i></a><a class="cU" href="https://twitter.com/EliteDaily/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><i class="ec"></i></a><a class="cU" href="https://www.pinterest.com/elitedaily/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><i class="c_"></i></a><a class="cU" href="https://instagram.com/elitedaily/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><i class="cY"></i></a><a class="cU" href="https://www.snapchat.com/discover/Elite-Daily/8822570171" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><i class="ea"></i></a></div></li><li><div class="u"><a href="https://bustle.company/">About</a><a href="https://www.elitedaily.com/contact">Contact</a><a href="https://www.elitedaily.com/newsletter">Newsletter</a><a href="https://www.elitedaily.com/terms">Terms</a><a href="https://www.elitedaily.com/privacy">Privacy</a></div></li><li><div class="B"></div></li></ul></div></nav></div><div class="cn co"><div class="cp"><div class="cq">Our website uses cookies to give you an easy and personalised experience and to support our marketing campaigns, including delivering our ads to you during your online experience on other sites.
