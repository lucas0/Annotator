<li> <b>Do you have copies of original documents and do you function like 
          an archive?</b><br/>
<br/>
          No. We work in conjunction with other archives and repositories that 
          house the original documents. We are a documentary publishing effort. 
          The two archives with the largest holdings of King material are Boston 
          Univeristy's Mugar Library and The King Center in Atlanta, Georgia.

<br/>
          Yes, you can find it on our website under Popular King. Look for "Voice 
          of King" and "Address at March on Washington for Jobs and 
          Freedom". If you wish to purchase the full audio of Dr. King's 
          "I Have a Dream Speech," it is available in the Time Warner

<br/>
          The Martin Luther King, Jr. Papers Project does not own the rights to 
          photos. Two quick and easy ways to find King photos for use are through 
          the following websites: <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080205092412/http://www.stockphoto.com/" target="main">stock photo</a> and <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080205092412/http://www.corbis.com/" target="main">Corbis</a>. <br/>
<br/>
</li>
<li> <b>Are there any teaching materials available on Dr. King? </b><br/>
<br/>
          Currently we are working on teaching materials on Dr. King. Our first 
          step has been to increase the availability of primary materials online. 
          Please continue to browse through our site for interesting materials. 
          Be sure to <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080205092412/http://www.stanford.edu/group/King/about_the_project/contact/email.fft">contact

<li> <b>Is there a way to search the King documents online for particular

<br/>
          We have a search engine accessible from the upper left hand corner of 
          our page. However, if you do not find the quote you are looking for

          While many books are available regarding the life and movement of Dr.

</li><li> <b>What is the Project's response to the accusations of plagiarism 
          against Dr. King?</b><br/>
<br/>
          The Martin Luther King, Jr. Papers Project addresses these concerns 
          on pp. 25-26 of Volume II of The Papers of Martin Luther King, Jr. entitled 
          "Rediscovering Precious Values, July 1951-November 1955," 
          Clayborne Carson, Senior Editor. Following is an excerpt from these 
          pages:<br/>
<br/>
<cite>. . . .The readers of King's dissertation, L. Harold DeWolf and 
          S. Paul Schilling, a professor of systematic theology who had recently 
          arrived at Boston University, failed to notice King's problematic use 
          of sources. After reading a draft of the dissertation, DeWolf criticized 
          him for failing to make explicit "presuppositions and norms employed 
          in the critical evaluation," but his comments were largely positive. 
          He commended King for his handling of a "difficult" topic 
          "with broad learning, impressive ability and convincing mastery 
          of the works immediately involved." Schilling found two problems 
          with King's citation practices while reading the draft, but dismissed 
          these as anomalous and praised the dissertation in his Second Reader's 
          report. . . .<br/>
<br/>
          As was true of King's other academic papers, the plagiaries in his dissertation 
          escaped detection in his lifetime. His professors at Boston, like those 
          at Crozer, saw King as an earnest and even gifted student who presented 
          consistent, though evolving, theological identity in his essays, exams 
          and classroom comments. . . .Although the extent of King's plagiaries 
          suggest he knew that he was at least skirting academic norms, the extant 
          documents offer no direct evidence in this matter. Thus he may have 
          simply become convinced, on the basis of his grades at Crozer and Boston, 
          that his papers were sufficiently competent to withstand critical scrutiny. 
          Moreover, King's actions during his early adulthood indicate that he 
          increasingly saw himself as a preacher appropriating theological scholarship 
          rather than as an academic producing such scholarship. . . .</cite><br/>

<li><b>Are you able to verify quotes and accept research requests?</b><br/>
<br/>
          Because we are on a publishing schedule, we are unable to do in-depth 
          research for outside requests without charging a fee. Depending on the 
          nature of the research request, we are able to verify quotes and accept 
          research requests that are not considered in-depth.</li>
