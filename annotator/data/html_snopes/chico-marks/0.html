<p align="left" style="text-indent: 30"> 
            </p>
<p align="left">
<font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial" size="2">Thank you so much for the 
            invitation to speak today. As many times as I have done so around 
            this country, I still admit to a slight case of butterflies as I 
            hear my name introduced…..which is really no problem as long as you 
            get them all to fly in close formation.</font></p>
<p align="left">
<font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial" size="2">I am not here today as some war 
            hero, or famous person. All I did was leave my plane in the jungles 
            of Viet Nam one day, and was lucky enough to survive the experience. 
            You know, they say a good landing is one you can walk away from, and 
            a great landing is when you can use the airplane again. Well I did 
            neither, and I address you today, as simply a fellow American 
            citizen.</font></p>
<p align="left">
<font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial" size="2">Since the events of September 
            11th, I hear a lot of people saying “God Bless America”. I believe 
            God has blessed America, in many ways, from the very inception of 
            this nation over 200 years ago.</font></p>
<p align="left">
<font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial" size="2">What were the odds that at the 
            very time the colonies decided to break from the British Empire, 
            that there would be a group of men in the new world, with the 
            intellect and vision to shape that process? God truly blessed us 
            with the collective perceptive genius of men like Jefferson, Adams, 
            Washington, Franklin, and others, who all came together, in those 
            colonies, at the exact moment in history when a nation was born. And 
            who would have bet that a group of upstart colonists, with little 
            resources, and even less of an army, could take on, and defeat, the 
            mighty British Empire? But they did, and a country was born.<br/>
            And when the fabric of this country was torn with a great Civil War, 
            God Blessed this nation with the wisdom and leadership of a 
            President Lincoln, who made the difficult choices, so that this 
            nation would survive as one.</font></p>
<p align="left">
<font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial" size="2">And when the United States was 
            thrust into World War II with a vicious attack on our forces at 
            Pearl Harbor, God Blessed this nation with a populace that rose to 
            the challenge, both on the home front and the battlefield. No finer 
            chapter in human history can be told of sacrifice, courage, and 
            resolve, than the countless stories of American soldiers, sailors, 
            airman and Marines during four years of the greatest global conflict 
            the world has ever known. Some of you here today were a part of that 
            generation that we now appropriately refer to as “the greatest 
            generation”. If World War II left us scarred with its inhumanity, 
            then it also left us the legacy of hope by those who made so many 
            sacrifices, and fought to victory, to insure the flame of freedom 
            still burns.</font></p>
<p align="left">
<font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial" size="2">Yes, I believe God has blessed 
            this nation in many ways, although sometimes we forget just how 
            fortunate we really are………and now, after a horrific attack on our 
            homeland, we find ourselves embattled in a war once again. And yet, 
            there are many who seem unsure of the response we should take. 
            Today, we honor so many who have given their lives, in defense of 
            this country……row upon row of tombstones, silent vigils to their 
            ultimate sacrifice. If the dead could speak today, they would tell 
            you that all it takes for evil to succeed in the world if for good 
            people to stand by and do nothing. They would emphatically declare 
            to you that you negotiate with the enemy with your knee in his chest 
            and your knife at his throat. And they would remind you that those 
            who forget their history, are condemned to repeat it.</font></p>
<p align="left">
<font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial" size="2">We are a nation guilty of 
            forgetting these lessons. Had we learned them better, our cemeteries 
            would be less full.</font></p>
<p align="left">
<font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial" size="2">We fought a Cold War for so long, 
            that perhaps we became weary and complacent, and when we won that 
            war, we became soft. We indulged ourselves in the notion that the 
            world was all-safe, and we thought a booming economy was ample 
            substitute for a strong military. Did we really think electing 
            self-serving politicians would make us stronger as a nation? Somehow 
            we came to accept the notion that freedom was free. It never has 
            been. The price of freedom has always been eternal vigilance. We 
            need to understand that there are those in the world who would 
            destroy us because our way of life threatens their quest for world 
            domination.</font></p>
<p align="left">
<font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial" size="2">This place we love, that we call 
            America, is not just a place, it is an idea. An idea manifested in 
            its people, a very diverse people. I heard a college student on TV 
            the other day say that if a mandatory draft was imposed, he would 
            head for Canada, as he had already mapped out his career, and 
            serving in the military was just not in his plans. <br/>
            Not in his plans…….I wonder if the young boys on the beaches at 
            Normandy had other plans, as their dead bodies washed ashore in a 
            sea of red. I’m sure the young men who found themselves in the 
            jungles of Viet Nam, watching their buddies die in an unnamed rice 
            patty fighting an unseen enemy had other plans. I guess those men 
            and women surprised at Pearl Harbor one morning had all their plans 
            rearranged in ways they could never have imagined. The people at the 
            World Trade Center have no more plans.<br/>
            But in this diversity, also comes our strength as a nation. All may 
            speak, and the will of the majority will be heard. Though we may 
            disagree, we are all Americans and live under the same flag. That 
            beautiful flag that has become such a symbol of freedom to the 
            world. For those who have fought on foreign soil, they understand 
            better than most the importance of this flag, and the strength 
            derived from its presence.</font></p>
<p align="left">
<font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial" size="2">This flag was carried in the 
            Revolutionary War, though it had many less stars, by men too weary, 
            and under equipped to expect victory, but persevere they did, and a 
            nation was born, with a new flag.</font></p>
<p align="left">
<font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial" size="2">This flag battle worn and 
            tattered, flew high on the mast of John Paul Jones’ ship, when he 
            showed the enemy what true resolve was.</font></p>
<p align="left">
<font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial" size="2">And brave men, raised this flag 
            on a Godforsaken island in the Pacific called Iwo Jima, and became 
            part of the most memorable photograph of the 20th Century. That 
            picture of our flag, raised high by our Marines during the bloodiest 
            battle in their history, did more for the morale of the American 
            people than any other picture or film of the entire war. This 
            weekend marks the Marine Corps birthday, and to all those Marines in 
            the crowd, I salute you, and thank you for your service. For those 
            of you who have not toured the Marine Memorial in Washington, DC, I 
            highly recommend it. Inscribed on the marble sides of the monument 
            you will find the words, “When uncommon valor was a common virtue”. 
            You will also see the stars and stripes waving proudly from its top.</font></p>
<p align="left">
<font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial" size="2">This flag of ours was even 
            carried to the moon, by men with a vision, and the courage to see it 
            through. And this same flag has been raised amidst the rubble of the 
            World Trade Center, as a reminder to those who would think they 
            could destroy this nation so easily.<br/>
            I can tell you personally, that just seeing that red, white, and 
            blue banner can mean so much. As I lay in a hospital bed, unable to 
            move, I can clearly remember seeing out the window, the very large 
            Garrison flag, flown on Sundays, waving majestically from its pole. 
            Just seeing it gave me an inner strength and motivation that I know, 
            in some way, helped me to be where I am today. I can also remember 
            years later, while fighting terrorism in Libya, my backseater and I 
            were piercing the sky above Mohammar Khaddafi in our SR-71, dodging 
            the missiles he sent after us. As we turned toward the 
            Mediterranean, I clearly recall the reflection of the American Flag 
            patch on the arm of my space suit, visible in the rear view mirror. 
            Now, don’t ask me why we had rear view mirrors on the world’s 
            fastest jet, I can assure you, no one was gaining on us. But just 
            seeing it gave me a sense of security, and reminded me that we were 
            a part of something much bigger, and better than the land we had 
            just imprinted with our sonic boom.</font></p>
<p align="left">
<font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial" size="2">I have always found it 
            interesting that those arguing for the right to burn the flag, are 
            usually the least willing to defend those rights, and are made free 
            and kept so by better men than themselves. When I see the rows of 
            American flags today at cemeteries across this nation, I know those 
            we are honoring, if they could speak, would tell you thanks and how 
            proud they are to have that flag flying by their name.</font></p>
<p align="left">
<font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial" size="2">This will not be an easy struggle 
            for us, this new type of terrorist war. I pray for our leaders. Some 
            have questioned if President Bush is up to this great challenge. I 
            recall the quote of Admiral “Bull” Halsey in World War II when he 
            said, “There are no great men, only great circumstances, and how 
            they deal with those circumstances will determine the outcome of 
            history.” I believe God has blessed this nation with good men, 
            strong men, in leadership positions today. Men not afraid to make 
            the difficult decisions. Men who understand that nothing in our 
            history tells us that preserving and protecting this free nation 
            would ever be easy.</font></p>
<p align="left">
<font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial" size="2">America is only as strong as its 
            people. We are the caretakers of all that our forefathers created, 
            and fought for. It is now our turn to show resolve and preserve 
            those precious freedoms that we have for too long taken for granted. 
            The enemy that knows it cannot defeat us on the battlefield, will 
            try to defeat us through fear and dissension amongst ourselves. Wars 
            are not won only on the field of battle, but are won by the will of 
            the people.</font></p>
<p align="left">
<font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial" size="2">I take heart that this nation 
            will be strong. Even while the first shot was still being fired, 
            brave Americans aboard Flight 93 took a stand and fought back. They 
            were the first heroes of this war. In a terrorist war of this type, 
            we are all soldiers. We must remain resolved, focused, and committed 
            to defeating this most heinous of enemies. While our soldiers fight 
            the enemy on his home front, we must endure on our own home front, 
            the tiresome wailings of liberal newscasters who seem to think that 
            our military is the enemy, as they over-scrutinize every move they 
            make, smugly reporting every civilian casualty as if it represents a 
            failing of some sort. We must also endure a media that is capable of 
            only criticizing our own government. Personally I believe we are 
            winning the war on both fronts.<br/>
            And we must win, as this is truly a nation that must be preserved. 
            We represent the freedom that so many people on this earth seek. It 
            is why everyone wants to come to this country. But so few can really 
            understand this nation. We are a two-edged sword, united but full of 
            disagreement. We exercise capitalistic greed frequently, yet have 
            been the most gracious humanitarian nation on earth. We are the 
            high-tech of Silicon Valley and the heartland of the Midwest. An 
            impatient people, yet tremendously resilient in difficult times.<br/>
            I can remember, after the Cold War was over, speaking with a former 
            Soviet Mig pilot. He marveled over how our country could produce a 
            plane such as the SR-71. He said the image he had of our country was 
            one of decadence, Hollywood, and discarded products. He could not 
            understand how we could have built a plane with such integrity that 
            would last so long and remain the world’s record holder in speed and 
            altitude for all these years. I told him that indeed, we were a 
            nation of excesses, and even ignorance at times, but that when men 
            are free, all things are possible.</font></p>
<p align="left">
<font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial" size="2">With all our faults, warts and 
            all, we are still the greatest nation on earth…..<br/>
            From the Declaration of Independence and the Monroe Doctrine, to 
            Disneyland and Donald Duck…..we are the USS Missouri pounding enemy 
            shores, flying the stars and stripes, to Mickey Mantle in pinstripes 
            pounding American League pitching……..from John Phillip Sousa to 
            Elvis Presley…….we are Mark Twain, and Microsoft……….Charles 
            Lindbergh and Paris, to Charley Brown and Peanuts……..we are a nation 
            that went from Kitty Hawk to Tranquility Base, in less than 70 
            years. Who can truly understand this greatness that is America, 
            unless they have lived it? And who would dare to try and destroy us?</font></p>
<p align="left">
<font color="#FFFFFF" face="Arial" size="2">As we pause today to remember 
            those heroes of our past, it should give us strength as we recall 
            their commitment and resolve. Let us also remember today, those 
            veterans who are still alive, and give them our thanks before they 
            too pass from our ranks. And all those men and women serving on 
            active duty today, far from home, performing their duty with little 
            thanks or recognition. Before you leave today, take time to walk 
            around the grounds and view the planes on display, and appreciate 
            what they meant in our nations history, and think about the crews 
            who flew them and helped to win victories in WW II, Korea, Viet Nam, 
            and played integral parts in the winning of the cold war. Each one 
            has a story.</font></p>
<p align="left">
<font face="Arial"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2">The preservation of this 
            nation is in our hands- there will be no points for second place. 
            Wave your flag proudly today, salute it, honor it. Long may it wave.
            <br/>
            Thank you.<br/>
