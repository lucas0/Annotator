Airlines</font></h1>
<p align="left"><font face="Trebuchet MS, Arial, MS Sans Serif" size="2">Eastern Airlines
was one of the “Big Four” airlines that dominated the passenger airline
business in the United States for nearly 50 years. Of the four, Eastern
Airlines probably also had the most turbulent history.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Trebuchet MS, Arial, MS Sans Serif" size="2">The birth of
Eastern Airlines is associated with the name of Clement Keys, a former
financial editor of <i>The Wall Street
Journal</i> who was an untiring promoter of multimillion-dollar aviation corporations
in the 1920s and 1930s. In early 1929, Keys decided to purchase a small
Philadelphia-based airline known as Pitcairn Aviation, Inc., that had been
formed on September 15, 1927. Keys then sold Pitcairn to North American Aviation,
then a holding company for a number of airline and aircraft companies in
which he was one of the key shareholders. On January 17, 1930, Pitcairn's
name was changed to Eastern Air Transport, Inc. and soon after, the airline
expanded its routes to include Atlanta, Miami, and Boston and in August to
Richmond, Virginia. Its fleet at the time consisted of three <a href="../../Dictionary/Ford_Trimotor/DI84.htm">Ford Trimotors</a> and two
Fokker F-X aircraft. These were joined soon by Curtiss Condors and Kingbirds.
World War I ace Eddie Rickenbacker served as general manager of Eastern.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Trebuchet MS, Arial, MS Sans Serif" size="2">While most of
the major airlines were focusing on transcontinental flights, Eastern's
specialty was the East Coast, and it was here that it established a near
monopoly. Through 1933, the airline acquired contracts for a number of routes
that spanned from New York to Miami. Eastern catered to the high demand for
quick passenger travel between the northeastern states and the vacation areas
of Florida.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Trebuchet MS, Arial, MS Sans Serif" size="2">In 
September 1933, the U.S. Senate set up a special committee to investigate 
allegations of favoritism and excessive government subsidy for the 
<a href="../../Government_Role/1930-airmail/POL6.htm">airmail carriers</a> in the 
country. A major scandal over mail contracts ensued, but the new 
Roosevelt administration—after a disastrous interlude during which 
the military flew the mail—restored a revised mail contract system 
in 1934. Airlines that had benefited from the “Spoils Conference” 
in 1930 that had distributed key routes originally were not allowed 
to bid for the new contracts. To get around this problem, many airlines 
renamed themselves. As a result, Eastern Air Transport became Eastern 
Air Lines.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Trebuchet MS, Arial, MS Sans Serif" size="2">In the 1930s,
Eastern acquired a number of companies such as the Wedell-Williams Transport
Corporation (in December 1936) in order to expand its routes. In April 1938,
North American Aviation finally sold Eastern because of criticism that it was
unfair for a single company to both produce and operate aircraft as North
American did. Rickenbacker, with the help of some of his associates, bought
Eastern wholesale from North American.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Trebuchet MS, Arial, MS Sans Serif" size="2">Rickenbacker was
responsible for setting up Eastern's <i>Great
Silver Fleet</i>, a famous fleet of <a href="../../Aerospace/boeing-1930s_1940s/Aero19.htm">DC-2</a> aircraft
that operated on the East Coast, one of which became the first commercial
airplane to touch down at Washington, D.C.'s new National Airport in June 1941.
It was also under Rickenbacker's reign that Eastern became the world's first
airline to begin mail service using <a href="../../Dictionary/autogyro/DI8.htm">autogyros</a>.
On July 6, 1939, it began an autogyro service in Philadelphia between the
city's post office and Camden Airport in New Jersey. The service lasted about a
year. During this time, in the late 1930s, Eastern was enjoying increasing
profits year after year.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Trebuchet MS, Arial, MS Sans Serif" size="2">In World War II,
Eastern joined in supporting the war effort. In March 1942, it began military
support flights connecting Florida, Pennsylvania, and Texas. Further routes
were added to Trinidad in the Caribbean. Eventually, in September 1942, Eastern
created its Military Transport Division (MTD) based in Miami comprising a fleet
of Curtiss C-46 Commando aircraft. In the civilian sector, Eastern gained a big
victory when the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB), the organization that decided
which airline would fly which route, allowed Eastern in June 1944 to compete on
the prized New York-Boston route; previously American Airlines had held a
monopoly on the route.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Trebuchet MS, Arial, MS Sans Serif" size="2">After the war,
Eastern became even stronger. In a move to replace its aging <a href="../../Aerospace/DC-3/Aero29.htm">DC-3</a> fleet, in April
1950, the company ordered ten of the new <a href="../../Aerospace/Lockheed_in_Mid-Century/Aero15.htm">Lockheed</a>
L.1049 Super Constellation airplanes. Eastern also successfully acquired a
Canadian company, Colonial Airlines, in June 1956 that allowed the airline to
begin service to Canadian cities such as Montreal and Ottawa. At the time of
the acquisition, Eastern Airlines had an unmatched safety record: it had been
operating as an airline for more than 25 years without a single passenger
fatality. It was undoubtedly the most important airline on the East Coast of
the United States, although it no longer held the monopoly on key routes such
as between New York and Miami. Eastern also diversified into Mexico. On July
23, 1957, it began a New York-New Orleans-Mexico City service using DC-7
aircraft.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Trebuchet MS, Arial, MS Sans Serif" size="2">In terms of its
fleet, Eastern was quick to adopt <a href="../Eastern%20Airlines/../Opening_of_Jet_era/Tran6.htm">jet
planes</a> . Eastern was the first of the “Big Four” to begin using
the Boeing 727 jet that would revolutionize air travel. Eastern's first 727 flight
took place on the Philadelphia-Washington-Miami route on February 1, 1964.
Eastern also used the Douglas DC-9, beginning February 1965. Rickenbacker had
already left Eastern by then, retiring on December 31, 1963 after nearly a
quarter century leading the company.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Trebuchet MS, Arial, MS Sans Serif" size="2">To expand,
Eastern executives were well aware that they would have to extend their routes
beyond the East Coast. As a result, in 1967, it began flying passengers to the
Bahamas and to Seattle on the West Coast. The company also expanded into the
Caribbean in 1971 by acquiring a small Puerto Rican company known as Caribair.
Eastern had experienced low growth rates in the early 1960s, but affairs
improved in the late 1970s. An important turning point for Eastern was when the
CAB granted the airline rights to fly into Los Angeles. Eastern was thus able
to inaugurate its first coast-to-coast flight on September 21, 1969, the last
of the “Big Four” to do so. At the time, Eastern ranked fourth among this group
in terms of passenger-miles flown annually.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Trebuchet MS, Arial, MS Sans Serif" size="2">In the 1970s,
Eastern's big purchase was that of the European <a href="../../Aerospace/Airbus/Aero52.htm">Airbus A-300</a>. Airbus
had tried unsuccessfully to break into the U.S. market for many years. After
Airbus offered a very generous deal to Eastern, Eastern's new president, former
NASA astronaut Frank Borman, agreed to buy 23 of the new jets in the spring of
1978. For Airbus, this was one of the most important breakthroughs into the
U.S. market and ensured a reliable customer base for future Airbus models.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Trebuchet MS, Arial, MS Sans Serif" size="2">Eastern did not
fare well in the 1980s. Under Borman's shaky command, the company was in deep
trouble as a result of major disagreements between management and the labor
unions, and also because of major debt from purchases in the late 1970s. As
Borman ineffectively tried to get pay cuts to compensate for debts, Eastern
began to rack up year after year of losses until late 1985, when it had a debt
of $3.5 billion. It was at this point that <a href="../../Dictionary/lorenzo/DI131.htm">Frank Lorenzo</a>, the infamous
airline powerbroker who controlled Continental Airlines, stepped in. After Borman
failed to get any significant concessions from his trade unions, Lorenzo bought
the whole airline for only $615 million, adding Eastern to his existing prizes
of People's Express, Frontier Airlines, Texas Air, and New York Air. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Trebuchet MS, Arial, MS Sans Serif" size="2">Lorenzo was
ruthless in using Eastern's core assets for his other airlines, devising
various ways to use them to make money for his other properties. He let Texas
Air “purchase” Eastern's advanced reservation system but issued only an I.O.U.
for it. Eastern then had to pay Texas Air a monthly fee of $10 million to use
its own system. He “sold” six of Eastern's planes to Continental but paid
nothing for them. The result was that, to survive, Eastern had to sell off
aircraft and lay off workers in large numbers. As tensions mounted between the
labor unions and Lorenzo's harsh tactics, Lorenzo slowly began to dismantle
Eastern and sell off its parts. When the unions struck in March 1989, Lorenzo
filed for bankruptcy. This gave him some breathing room and allowed him to use
strikebreakers to continue operations. By this time, however, Eastern was
collapsing under its debt, and finally in January 1991, the airline completely
ran out of money to operate. In late 1991, the airline was liquidated. Thus
ended the life of one of America's greatest domestic airlines.</font></p>
