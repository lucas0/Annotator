<h1 class="tei-head7">The Treaty of Portsmouth and the Russo-Japanese War, <span class="tei-date">1904–1905</span>
</h1>
<p class="tei-p2">The Treaty of Portsmouth formally ended the Russo-Japanese War of 1904–05. The
                    negotiations took place in August in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, and were
                    brokered in part by U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt. The final agreement was
                    signed in September of 1905, and it affirmed the Japanese presence in south
                    Manchuria and Korea and ceded the southern half of the island of Sakhalin to
                    Japan.</p>
<div class="tei-figure2">

<div class="tei-head1">Photograph from the Russo-Japanese War</div>
</div>
<p class="tei-p2">By 1904, Russia and Japan had endured several years of disputes over control of
                    Manchuria. The Russians had entered the region during the Sino-Japanese War of
                    1894–95 and, along with Germany and France, was a part of the “Triple
                    Intervention” that forced Japan to give up its demands for ports in South
                    Manchuria and the Liaodong Peninsula in the wake of its victory in China.
                    Instead, Russia moved into the area and took control of Port Arthur, a warm
                    water port with strategic and commercial significance. A Japanese attempt to
                    stage a coup in adjacent Korea was thwarted in part by the Russian presence in
                    the region, and the two nations’ divergent interests appeared more and more
                    likely to clash.</p>
<p class="tei-p2">In 1904, the Japanese attacked the Russian fleet at Port Arthur before the formal
                    declaration of war was received in Moscow, surprising the Russian navy and
                    earning an early victory. Over the course of the next year, the two forces
                    clashed in Korea and the Sea of Japan, with the Japanese scoring significant,
                    but costly, victories. War casualties were high on both sides. At the battle
                    over Mukden, the Russians lost 60,000 soldiers and the Japanese lost 41,000
                    soldiers. The military costs were high as well. A Russian fleet made the long
                    trip from the Baltic Sea around Africa and India, only to be half destroyed by
                    the Japanese upon its arrival in Northeast Asia. By 1905, the combination of
                    these losses and the economic cost of financing the war led both countries to
                    seek an end to the war.</p>

<div class="tei-head1">Photograph of Attack on Port Arthur</div>
</div>
<p class="tei-p2">The Japanese asked U.S. President Roosevelt to negotiate a peace agreement, and
                    representatives of the two nations met in Portsmouth, New Hampshire in 1905. For
                    the sake of maintaining the balance of power and equal economic opportunity in
                    the region, Roosevelt preferred that the war end on terms that left both Russia
                    and Japan a role to play in Northeast China. Though excited by the Japanese
                    military victories, Roosevelt worried about the consequences to American
                    interests if Japan managed to drive Russia out entirely.</p>
<p class="tei-p2">The negotiations centered on access to ports and territories in Manchuria and
                    Korea, control of Sakhalin Island, and the question of who was responsible for
                    paying war costs. The chief aims of the Japanese negotiator included first
                    control in Korea and South Manchuria, then the negotiation of an indemnity and
                    control of Sakhalin Island. The Russians wanted to maintain Sakhalin Island,
                    refused to pay a war costs indemnity to the Japanese, and hoped to maintain
                    their fleet in the Pacific. The indemnity issue, along with the dispensation of
                    Sakhalin Island, were the major sticking points in the negotiation, although
                    given its financial straits in 1905, Russia was likely unable to pay an
                    indemnity even if required by a treaty to do so.</p>
<p class="tei-p2">When negotiations reached an impasse, Roosevelt stepped in with the proposal that
                    Russia “buy back” the northern part of Sakhalin from Japanese control. The
                    Russians were adamant that they would not pay any amount of money, which would
                    act as a disguised indemnity, when the territory ought to be theirs. After long
                    internal debate, Japan eventually agreed to take only the southern half of the
                    island, without any kind of payment. Theirs had not been a decisive enough
                    victory to force the point.</p>
<p class="tei-p2">The Treaty ultimately gave Japan control of Korea and much of South Manchuria,
                    including Port Arthur and the railway that connected it with the rest of the
                    region, along with the southern half of Sakhalin Island; Russian power was
                    curtailed in the region, but it was not required to pay Japan’s war costs.
                    Because neither nation was in a strong financial position to continue the war
                    easily, both were forced to compromise in the terms of the peace. Still, the
                    Japanese public felt they had won the war, and they considered the lack of an
                    indemnity to be an affront. There was a brief outbreak of protests and rioting
                    in Tokyo when the terms of the agreement were made public. Similarly, the
                    Russian people were also dissatisfied, angry about giving up half of
                    Sakhalin.</p>
<div class="tei-figure2">

<div class="tei-head1">Individuals gathered to work out what became the Treaty of
                        Portsmouth</div>
</div>
<p class="tei-p2">Throughout the war and the peace talks, American public opinion largely sided
                    with Japan. Believing that the Japanese were fighting a “just war” against
                    Russian aggression, and that the island nation was equally committed to the Open
                    Door and the territorial integrity of China, the American people were anxious to
                    support it. This sense did not really change over the course of the
                    negotiations, in spite of the best efforts of the Russian negotiator to improve
                    the press coverage of his nation’s position. The final decision of the Japanese
                    to forgo an indemnity only served to strengthen U.S. approval of Japan’s actions
                    throughout the conflict. The anti-treaty and, at times, anti-American
                    demonstrations in Tokyo that followed the ratification of the treaty caught many
                    Americans off-guard.</p>
<p class="tei-p2">The Treaty of Portsmouth marked the last real event in an era of U.S.-Japanese
                    cooperation that began with the Meiji Restoration in 1868. Instead, competition
                    between the two nations in the Pacific grew over the years that followed.
                    Conversely, Japanese relations with Russia improved in the wake of the treaty.
                    Although the actual importance of Roosevelt’s mediation and personal pressure on
                    the leadership in Moscow and Tokyo to the final agreement is unclear, he won the
                    Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts in moderating the talks and pushing toward
                    peace.</p>
