Elite Daily reached out to the White House for comment on the claims, but did not hear back. However, Trump denied all of the claims made by Manigault in a series of tweets on August 13 calling his former aide "wacky," "vicious," "not smart," and a "low life" — and then took it one step further and<a class="" href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1029329583672307712" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> called Manigault a dog</a>. </p><div class="teads-adCall"></div><p>While of course calling someone a dog is a terrible thing to do in any situation, apparently it's actually the worst insult Trump has in his arsenal, according to <em>The Washington Post. </em>Sources who have observed Trump for a while told the publication on Tuesday that calling Manigault "that dog" shows how angry he is because he has "<a class="" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/he-created-omarosa-how-trumps-protege-turned-his-tactics-against-him/2018/08/14/53d2c8f0-9fcd-11e8-83d2-70203b8d7b44_story.html?utm_term=.31ed5694acc3" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">an aversion to dogs and other pets</a>."

It's even better now that we know Trump is not a fan of the doggos. </p><p>With everything else going on in the White House, most of us probably haven't noticed that there's no furry friend running around the Oval Office.

President Donald Trump, and now we might finally know why."],[0,[1],1," Donald Trump reportedly hates dogs"],[0,[],0," — so that might explain why there's nothing cute in the White House RN."]]],[1,"p",[[0,[],0,"Former aide and "],[0,[2],1,"Apprentice "],[0,[],0,"hotshot Omarosa Manigault released a new tell-all book,"],[0,[2],1,"Unhinged"],[0,[],0,", on Tuesday, August 14 that included several allegations against the president and his staff — including claims that there are tapes of Trump saying the N-word. Elite Daily reached out to the White House for comment on the claims, but did not hear back. However, Trump denied all of the claims made by Manigault in a series of tweets on August 13 calling his former aide \"wacky,\" \"vicious,\" \"not smart,\" and a \"low life\" — and then took it one step further and"],[0,[3],1," called Manigault a dog"],[0,[],0,". "]]],[1,"p",[[0,[],0,"While of course calling someone a dog is a terrible thing to do in any situation, apparently it's actually the worst insult Trump has in his arsenal, according to "],[0,[2],1,"The Washington Post.

"]]],[1,"p",[[0,[],0,"So \"that dog\" insult is even worse that we might have initially thought, but at least we know why there are no pets in the White House.

It's even better now that we know Trump is not a fan of the doggos.
