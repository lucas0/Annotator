The Western Wall in the midst of the Old City in Jerusalem
is the section of the Western supporting wall of the
Temple Mount which has remained intact since the destruction of the
<a href="http://mosaic.lk.net/glossary.html#temple">Second Jerusalem Temple</a> (70 C.E.). It became the most sacred spot in Jewish
religious and national consciousness and tradition by virtue of its
proximity to the Western Wall of the Holy of Holies in the Temple,
from which, according to numerous sources, the Divine Presence never
departed. It became a center of mourning over the destruction of
the Temple and Israel's exile, on the one hand, and of religious -
in 20th century also national - communion with the memory of Israel's
former glory and the hope for its restoration, on the other. 
Because of the former association, it became known in European languages
as the "Wailing Wall".

<p>
Most of the Western Wall of the Temple Mount, which was about 485 m. long,
is hidden by the buildings adjoining it. Until June 1967 the accessible 
portion of the wall was  no longer than 28 m. In front of it ran a 
stone-paved alley 3.5 m wide bordered on its west by a slum area.
The Wall aboveground consisted of 24 
rows of stones of different dressing and age, reaching a total height of 18 m.
with 6 m. above the level of the Temple Mount. In 1867 excavations revealed
that 19 more rows lay buried underground, the lowest being sunk into
the natural rock of the Tyropoeon Valley.
</p><p>
In 1968 the ground in front of the Wall was excavated to reveal two of the
buried rows of stone, and the Wall then consisted of seven layers of huge, 
marginally dressed ("Herodian") stones from the <a href="http://mosaic.lk.net/glossary.html#temple">Second Temple</a>,
above which
are four layers of smaller, plainly dressed stones from the Roman
or Byzantine periods. The upper stones were constructed after
the  <a href="http://mosaic.lk.net/glossary.html#moslemc">Moslem conquest</a>.
</p><p>
Jewish travelers over the centuries used to marvel the immense dimensions
of the lower stones - average height  1 m and length 3 m, but some
as long as 12 m. and weighing over 100 tons - and believed they were part of 
Solomon's Temple. They were probably quarried at the Cave of Zedkiah
(near the Damascus Gate). In order to withstand the soil pressure of the 
filling behind the Wall, the rows were laid in a terraced manner,
each row being set back a few centimeters relative to the one beneath it.
The Wall thus slants slightly eastward. This factor, the weight of the 
stones, and the accuracy of the cutting account for the unusual stability
of the Wall.
</p><p>
The underground tunnel starting at the north-west of the prayer plaza
passes close to the part of the Western Wall that is hidden by the buildings.
It goes through a system of vaulted areas and water cisterns. About
350 m. of the Wall have been uncovered, up to the northern edge,
which is the north-western corner of the Temple Mount. In a tunnel
the largest stones of the Wall were found, including a giant stone
about 60 m long, 3 m. high and 4 m. wide, and weighing approximately
400 tons.
</p><p>
<a name="tradition"> </a></p><h4><a name="tradition"> Jewish Tradition and the Wall</a></h4><a name="tradition"> </a>
<p>
Since 132 CE (the failure of the <a href="http://mosaic.lk.net/glossary.html#bkrevolt">Bar Kokhba revolt</a>), 
the prayers of Israel
both in the <a href="http://mosaic.lk.net/glossary.html#lisrael">Land of Israel</a> and throughout the 
<a href="http://mosaic.lk.net/glossary.html#diaspora">Diaspora</a> were directed
towards the
site of the destroyed Temple. The Temple itself, as well as all 
the structures
on the Temple Mount, became endeared to the Jews. 
The <a href="http://mosaic.lk.net/glossary.html#midrash">Midrashic</a> sources of this period speak about the Western Wall
of the Holy of Holies from which the Divine Presence never moves.
Since the Holy of Holies was destroyed, the notion of eternal Divine
Presence became associated with the Western Wall of the Temple Mount.
</p><p>
Sources about the Jews in Jerusalem up to 16th century note their attachment
to the site of the Holy Place, but the Western Wall is not referred to 
specifically, though the scroll of Ahimaaz (11th century) mentions
a synagogue by the side of the Western Wall, and Benjamin from Tudela (12th
century) mentions the Western Wall, together with the Mercy Gate (which is 
in the eastern wall of the Temple Mount). 
</p><p>
The Western Wall became a permanent feature in Jewish tradition about 1520,
either as a result of the immigration of the <a href="http://mosaic.lk.net/glossary.html#spexile">Spanish exiles</a>
 or in the wake
of the <a href="http://mosaic.lk.net/glossary.html#ottoman">Turkish conquest</a> in 1518.
Thenceforth all literary sources describe it
as a place of assembly and prayer for Jews. According to a tradition
transmitted by Moses Hafiz, it was the sultan Selim (Suleiman) the conqueror
of Jerusalem
who recovered the wall from underneath the dungheap which was hiding it and 
granted permission to the Jews to hold prayers there. No Muslim sources
about Jerusalem bear any evidence of the Arab interest in the Western Wall.
The nearby area became Muslim religious property at the end of 12th century,
and from 1320 there is mention of the Moghrabi Quarter established there.
Nevertheless, Jews were able to hold their prayers at the Wall undisturbed.
</p><p>
</p><p>
<a name="modern"> </a></p><h4><a name="modern"> The Recent History </a></h4><a name="modern"> </a>
<p>
</p><p>
With the expansion of the Jewish population in the Land of Israel
from the beginning
of the 19th century onward, and with the increase in visitors, the popularity
of the Western Wall grew among Jews. Its image began to appear in Jewish
folkloristic art, and later also in modern art drawings and in
literature. The 19th century also was the beginning of the
archaeological study if the Western Wall north and south of the open
prayer spot. In 1838 Robinson discovered the arch since named after
him, and in 1850s Barclay laid bare the ancient gate (now in the
corner of the women's section). In 1865 Wilson described the bridge
discovered by Tobler in the 1830th. In 1867 Sir Charles Warren sank shafts
to reveal the full length if the wall.
</p><p>
During the 19th century the Jewish attempted to
to get control of the Wall. In the 1850s Hakham Abdullah of Bombay
failed in his efforts to buy it. Sir Moses Montefiore tried
in vain to obtain permission for placing benches or for installing 
a protection against rain there. Permission to pave the street was,
however, granted. Occasionally a table for the reading of the Torah was
placed near the Wall, but had to be soon removed at the demands of
the Waqf (Muslim religious authorities). In 1887 Baron Rotschild,
basing on cooperation with Sephardi community, offered to buy 
the whole Moghrabi Quarter, resettle its residents and have it demolished. 
The plan never materialized, probably not only because of the Muslim
objections, but due to disagreements between leaders of the Sephardi
community. 
</p><p>
In 1912 the Turkish authorities  ordered the removal of a partition 
between men and women, benches, a glass cupboard for candles, a table 
for reading Torah, etc., after the complaints of Waqf. 
</p><p>
In the period of the <a href="http://mosaic.lk.net/glossary.html#britrule">British Mandate</a> there were numerous clashes
around the Western Wall between Jews and Moslems.
After the <a href="http://mosaic.lk.net/glossary.html#balfour">Balfour Declaration</a> has given the Jews
a recognized national status in the Land of Israel, the Western Wall
gained national significance among the Jews together with the traditional 
religious significance. On the other hand, the Arab mufti started to 
incite his community against the Zionists who, he claimed,
intended to seize control of the Wall. In order to antagonize
the Jews, the mufti ordered the opening of a gate at the southern end
of the street thus converting in into a a thoroughfare for passersby 
and animals. In addition the Muslims deliberately help loud-voiced
ceremonies in the vicinity. They also complained again about the placing
of accessories of worship near the Wall, and a partition between men and
women was removed by the British police on <a href="http://mosaic.lk.net/glossary.html#yomkipur">Yom Kippur</a> of 1928.
In August 1929 an instigated Muslim crowd rioted among the worshipers
and destroyed ritual objects. This unrest was followed by riots a few
days later.
</p><p>
The British set up a committee of inquiry and consequently an international
committee (consisting of a Swede, a Swiss, and a Dutchman) was appointed by
the League of Nations to resolve "the problem of the Wall". It conducted
in Jerusalem, in the summer of 1930, "the trial of the Wall". 
The commission concluded that the Muslims had absolute ownership of the Wall.
However, the Jews had the uncontested right to worship and to place seats 
in the street, though not to blow the <a href="http://mosaic.lk.net/glossary.html#shofar">shofar</a> there. The Arabs
objected, and the Jews agreed, except for the last point, considering 
it a humiliation. Each year nationalist youths would blow the shofar
near the wall at the termination of Yom Kippur, which would always
lead to the intervention of the British police.
</p><p>
From December 1947, after bloody incidents with the Arabs, Jews were no longer
able to approach the Wall. After the capitulation of the Jewish Quarter
of the Old City in May 1948, Jews were prevented for 19 years from even 
looking at the Wall from afar, in spite of a paragraph in the
<a href="http://mosaic.lk.net/glossary.html#armistice">cease-fire agreement</a> granting freedom of access to the
holy places.
</p><p>
The Wall was liberated on the third day of the <a href="http://mosaic.lk.net/glossary.html#sixday">Six-Day war</a>
(June 7, 1967) by
Israel's parachutists breaking through the "bloody gate" which the mufti
had opened. The Moghrabi quarter was immediately demolished, and on the
first day of Shavuot, quarter a million Jews swarmed to the place. Subsequently
the buildings placed against the Wall in its continuation southward
were removed. The entire cleared area in front of the Western Wall was leveled
and converted into a large paved open space. The lower square near the Wall
is the prayer area, where one may find people praying or studying,
either singly or in groups, day and night throughout the year. The surface
of the wall, from the pavement and up to the man's height, differs by
the color and feels differently - it is polished by human hands that
touched it in prayers through the centuries.
