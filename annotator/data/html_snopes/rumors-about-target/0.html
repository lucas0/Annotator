<h3>
		our founder George Draper Dayton</h3>
<p>
		In 1881, native New Yorker George D. Dayton decides to explore the growing Midwest markets. After several years in banking and real estate, Dayton decides Minneapolis offers the strongest opportunities for growth. He purchases land on Nicollet Avenue and forms the Dayton Dry Goods Company–today, known as Target Corporation.</p>
<p>
		Dayton's personal principles shapes the new store, including his belief in the "the higher ground of stewardship." His store soon becomes known for dependable merchandise, fair business practices and a generous spirit of giving. As President, he remains active in the store's management until his death in 1938. His son and grandsons take over leadership and begin to grow the Dayton Company into a nationwide retailer.</p>

<h3>
		Merchandise Takes Flight</h3>
<p>
		Merchandise shipments come to a standstill during a freight-handlers strike, preventing the shipment of goods from New York to Minneapolis. Facing the prospect of empty shelves and dissatisfied shoppers, Dayton's captures the imagination of America by using airplanes to transport goods across country. Two Curtiss Northwest Airplane Company planes pick up 400 pounds of merchandise and make the flight to Minnesota — the longest commercial flight ever at the time. The arriving planes are paraded through the streets of Minneapolis and throngs of onlookers immediately purchase the in-demand goods. This innovative solution helps pave the way to a new method of transporting merchandise across the United States.</p>

		Expansion to the Suburbs</h3>
<p>
		To meet the needs of busy suburban families, The Dayton Company expands to the suburbs oF Minneapolis with the opening of Southdale Mall, the nation's first fully enclosed shopping center. Southdale changes the face of retail in the United States when Dayton's takes the then unheard-of step of placing top competitors together under the same roof. Stores thrive as busy shoppers flock to the mall, and Dayton's follows suit with three more shopping centers over the next 20 years: Brookdale in 1962; Rosedale in 1969; and Ridgedale in 1974; all located within the Minneapolis/St. Paul metropolitan area.</p>

<h3>
		Entrance into Discount Retailing</h3>
<p>
		As The Dayton Company looks for new ways to strengthen relationships with guests, company leadership recognizes an opportunity to develop and introduce a new kind of mass-market discount store that caters to value-oriented shoppers seeking a higher-quality experience. At the time, the move toward mass-market retail is considered risky by some industry experts as it moves away from the company's dominant position as a department store retailer. By demonstrating visionary leadership, the company takes the first step toward transforming the organization from a family-run department-store chain into one of the nation's largest discount-store chains.</p>

<h3>
		Making it Official</h3>
<p>
		On May 9, 1961, the Minneapolis Tribune reports that The Dayton Company plans to form a new discount chain store. The store's new president, Douglas J. Dayton, draws upon the company's vast wealth of department store experience and states that the new store will, "combine the best of the fashion world with the best of the discount world, a quality store with quality merchandise at discount prices, and a discount supermarket...75 departments in all." Shopping at the new, currently unnamed store will be fun, delightful and welcoming to the entire family. The stores will include wide aisles, easy-to-shop displays, fast checkout and, "loads of well-lighted parking…for 1,200 cars."</p>

<h3>
		Creation of an Icon</h3>
<p>
		In the months before the first Target store opens its doors, former Dayton's Director of Publicity Stewart K. Widdess, is tasked to name and define the new retail store. Widdess and his staff debate more than 200 possible names. In a burst of red-and-white inspiration, they come up with "Target" and immediately envision a classic Bullseye logo. The reasoning behind the choice was, "As a marksman's goal is to hit the center bulls-eye, the new store would do much the same in terms of retail goods, services, commitment to the community, price, value and overall experience."</p>

<h3>
		The Birth of Target</h3>
<p>
		On May 1, 1962, guests in the Twin Cities area wake to the news of Target's first grand opening in Roseville, Minn. Heralded as a, "new idea in discount stores," Target differentiates itself from other retail stores by combining many of the best department store features — fashion, quality and service — with the low prices of a discounter. Created as, "a store you can be proud to shop in, a store you can have confidence in, a store that is fun to shop and exciting to visit," by the end of 1962, Target opens additional locations in St. Louis Park, Crystal and Duluth, Minn.</p>

President Donald C. Dayton takes the new position of chairman of the board, and Bruce B. Dayton steps into the president role. The corporation has five autonomous divisions: Dayton's department stores, Target Stores, B. Dalton Bookseller, Dayton Jewelers and Dayton Development Company. The corporate expansion opens new doors and becomes the first step in bringing Dayton's foundation of affordable, quality fashion, innovative management, community giving and good corporate governance to a national audience.</p>

Target takes significant action to further strengthen security across the network, including an accelerated $100 million plan to move our REDcard portfolio to chip-and-PIN-enabled technology and to install supporting software and next-generation payment devices in stores.

		Batter Up For Education</h3>
<p>
		Target and Major League Baseball (MLB) work together this baseball season to engage guests and fans in celebrating our nation’s teachers and inspiring kids. Efforts include Target joining MLB and PEOPLE’s longstanding tradition of recognizing community heroes through the Target Presents “PEOPLE All-Star Teachers” program, hosting a series of events in schools across the country and honoring teachers at the 2014 All-Star Game. Target announces that the company is now an official MLB sponsor, and will offer guests an expanded selection of MLB and All-Star Game merchandise in its stores and on Target.com.</p>

<h3>
		25 Years of Target Racing</h3>
<p>
		Sponsors in motorsports come and go, but Target and Chip Ganassi Racing (TCGR) have been together for 25 consecutive seasons, one of the longest current partnerships in racing history. Thanks to a team-centric philosophy and a drive for continuous innovation, TCGR has crossed many finish lines together over the years, resulting in more than 100 wins and making Target one of the most recognizable brands of victory lane. Oh, and don’t forget about the team’s 10 career IndyCar Series championships, four Indianapolis 500 victories and a trip to the Chase for the NASCAR Sprint Cup.</p>

		Made to Matter Collection</h3>
<p>
		In March, Target introduces Made to Matter — a first-of-its-kind partnership and collection from leading natural, organic and sustainable brands. The new Made to Matter collection features more than 120 new and exclusive products from a crew of trusted companies, taking the guesswork out of buying better-for-you products. Made to Matter products span baby, beauty and personal care, grocery, healthcare and household products, including Annie’s Homegrown, Burt’s Bees, Clif Bar &amp; Company, Ella’s Kitchen, EVOL, Horizon Organic, Hyland’s, Kashi, method, Plum Organics, Seventh Generation, SheaMoisture, Target’s Simply Balanced, Vita Coco, Yes To and Zarbee’s Naturals.</p>

<h3>
		Chip-and-PIN Technology Meets REDcard</h3>
<p>
		Target accelerates its $100 million plan to move its REDcard portfolio to chip-and-PIN-enabled technology and to install supporting software and next-generation payment devices in stores. In 2015, the entire REDcard portfolio, including all Target-branded credit and debit cards, will be enabled with MasterCard’s chip-and-PIN solution. Existing co-branded cards will be reissued as MasterCard co-branded chip-and-PIN cards. Ultimately, through this initiative, all of Target’s REDcard products will be chip-and-PIN secured. New payment terminals are now in all 1,801 U.S. stores, six months ahead of schedule, and will begin accepting payments from all chip-enabled cards in Target stores this year.</p>

Steinhafel steps down from his positions as Chairman of the Target board of directors, president and CEO. John Mulligan, Target’s chief financial officer, is appointed as interim president and chief executive officer. Roxanne S. Austin, a current member of Target’s board of directors, is appointed as interim non-executive chair of the board. The board notes their gratitude to Steinhafel for his significant contributions and outstanding service throughout his notable 35-year career with the company. His passion for the team and relentless focus on the guest established Target as a leader in the retail industry.</p>

<h3>
		Target Supports Marriage Equality</h3>
<p>
		In August, Target joins several other national companies to sign on to an amicus brief in support of marriage equality, currently pending in the Seventh Circuit. This brief evaluates the issues created by states that both prohibit same-sex marriage and also refuse to recognize marriages that were conducted legally in other states. This position is particularly challenging for a large organization that operates nationally, as we do. At Target, we have long offered comprehensive, competitive benefits to our LGBT team members and their families, often above what is legally required. We continue to do so today because we believe doing so is right for our team and for our business. But current laws—in places like Wisconsin and Indiana that are addressed in this brief—make it difficult to attract and retain talent. We believe that everyone—all of our team members and our guests—deserve to be treated equally. And at Target we are proud to support the LGBT community.</p>

Cornell, 55, joins Target with more than 30 years of experience at some of the nation’s leading retail and consumer product companies. As Target’s new CEO, Cornell’s top priorities will be accelerating the company’s performance and advancing Target’s omnichannel evolution.</p>
<p>
		Cornell most recently served as the chief executive officer of PepsiCo Americas Foods. Before joining PepsiCo in 2012, Cornell served as president and CEO of Sam’s Club. He was also CEO at Michaels Stores, Inc., and prior to that, executive vice president and chief marketing officer for Safeway.</p>

<p>
		We celebrate the 15th anniversary of Target House at St. Jude Children’s Research, with care provided over the years for 4,200 families nationwide. A few miles from the hospital’s campus, Target House’s 98 furnished two-bedroom apartments serve as a home away from home for families with children undergoing difficult and often lengthy treatments for cancer and other life-threatening diseases. Through St. Jude’s partnerships, like the one with Target, patient families never receive a bill from St. Jude for treatment, travel, housing or food.</p>

		Target and TOMS team up on a limited-edition collection for the holidays. Every TOMS for Target apparel, accessory and home good purchase results in the donation of a blanket through the American Red Cross or Canadian Red Cross, or one week of meals through Feeding America or Food Banks Canada. And for every TOMS for Target pair of shoes sold, a pair will go to a child in need. The partnership with TOMS is the perfect marriage of both brands’ core values–great design that’s accessible to everyone and a commitment to giving back.</p>

In August, Luke Bryan surprises fans with the #LukeBox project, turning their requests in to quick songs on YouTube as his Target-exclusive edition of “Kill the Lights” debuts. In November, we bring fans a special edition of Adele’s highly anticipated album, “25,” featuring three bonus tracks, and a series of TV spots with a unique look at seven of the new songs. It quickly surpasses Adele’s previous album, “21,” becoming Target’s top-selling album to date.</p>

After four weeks on display in New York, the exhibit heads to Florida for Miami Art Week. In July, Target Open House, our connected home lab and retail space, opens its doors in San Francisco. Here, Target showcases cutting-edge home technology and visitors can see how more than 30 connected home products work together within the Internet of Things. In December, Target Wonderland opens in New York. Part toy store and part larger-than-life holiday playground, Target Wonderland merges the physical and digital retail experience to reimagine holiday shopping for its guests. Visitors can play among Target’s top holiday products and use RFID technology to shop along the way.</p>

<p>
		As kids across the country head back to school, Target celebrates a major milestone, thanking guests for helping us reach our goal to give $1 billion for education by the end of 2015. Target’s support over the years has provided books, school supplies, food, field trips and lots more to students and schools across the U.S. and around the world.</p>

<h3>
		Wellness for All</h3>
<p>
		In September, Target announces a new CSR strategy centered on wellness—an area that’s become increasingly important to guests, and one where we know we can make an impact from across our business. Our goal is to help improve the health of the nation by making wellness the way of life—by making healthy eating, active living and clean-label product solutions (like simple, recognizable, easy to read ingredients and materials) more affordable, accessible and inspiring. Plans kick off to identify a full range of partnerships and programs dedicated to wellness that build on our legacy of work in education, sustainability, diversity and inclusion, and addressing local community needs.</p>

From upping our total ENERGY STAR certifications to adding solar panels to more of our stores, the commitments are part of our ongoing work to improve our energy efficiency, invest in renewable energy, and lower our overall HFC impact. So far, we’ve successfully reduced our GHG emissions by 9 percent and eliminated 550,000 metric tons of CO2e across all of our buildings.</p>

<h3>
		Remembering a Community Champion</h3>
<p>
		Target co-founder Bruce Dayton passes away on Nov. 13. An innovator, Bruce and his brothers and cousin helped to build the first indoor shopping mall, pioneered the concept of discount retail, and founded a company that would become one of the world’s largest private-sector employers. Bruce was known for making corporate social responsibility a top priority, understanding that a company’s business is fundamentally linked to the health and vitality of the community. He ensured that Target gave 5 percent of its profits back to the community—a commitment we’re proud to uphold today.</p>

To create the line’s more than 1,200 stylish pieces, our design team spends time with moms, dads, and most importantly, kids, to find out what makes them tick. Turns out one of their biggest challenges is creating a room that feels like an extension of their home, but still reflects the kid’s unique personality. So we create twelve print and pattern themes to give parents and kids the freedom to mix, match and make updates as the youngsters grow over time.</p>

<h3>
		Big Things in Store</h3>
<p>
		As part of a three-year, $7-billion+ capital investment, we kick off plans to fully remodel 110 stores in 2017, and 500 more by 2019. At the ShopTalk conference in March, CEO Brian Cornell unveils our next generation store design elements, with the first fully reimagined store opening near Houston in October 2017. The plans to reimagine the store experience also include opening 30 new small-format stores across the country in 2017 to expand our footprint into dense urban neighborhoods and on college campuses.</p>

<h3>
		In Good Supply</h3>
<p>
		Our teams continue to test and roll out new technology and services that make our supply chain faster and more efficient. In June, we open a new distribution facility in Perth Amboy, N.J., to test how we move product faster and more efficiently in the Northeast market. We begin testing a same-day delivery service in our Tribeca small-format store that lets guests have their purchases delivered anywhere in Manhattan and parts of Brooklyn and Queens. And we begin piloting Target Restock in Minneapolis, a service that lets guests use Target.com to fill a box with essentials and have it delivered to their home by the next day.</p>

To get guests moving, we partner with a breakout fitness star to create The C9 Champion Limited Edition by Anna Kaiser. And we celebrate a New Kind of Strong, featuring inspiring athletes in C9 Champion. Plus, we make waves (and continue to hold No. 1 marketshare) with our body-positive, unretouched #TargetSwim campaign.</p>

The store also features many of our top enhancements, digital and service upgrades, as well as a custom mural by a local artist featuring historic moments and icons from Minneapolis—including a nod to the Dayton family, who founded Target’s predecessor, The Dayton Company.</p>

We join Americans for Affordable Products, a coalition of 600+ businesses and trade associations opposed to the BAT proposal. CEO Brian Cornell visits Capitol Hill and makes media appearances, sharing our commitment to comprehensive tax reform, but our concerns about the BAT’s potential to raise prices for American families.</p>

<h2>2018</h2>
<h3>Fashion Sense</h3>
<p>We continue our efforts to design for sustainability across our business. In December, we take our next step forward, joining dozens of leading brands and industry organizations in signing onto the Fashion Industry Charter for Climate Action. As a member, we make commitments to help mobilize the fashion industry to create solutions to combat climate change, which also closely align with our own climate strategy and goals.</p>
