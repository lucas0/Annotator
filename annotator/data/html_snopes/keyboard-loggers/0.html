<h1>KeyGhost Security Keyboard</h1>
<address>
<small>Review date: 24 March 2000.<br/>
										Last modified 03-Apr-2013.</small></address>
<p> </p>
<p>If you think They have put a tiny device in your keyboard that records everything 
									you type and sends it to the Illuminati satellites so the Greys can keep tabs on your 
									every action, you may be right.</p>
<p>Well, except for the Illuminati-satellite part.</p>
<p>There are lots of ways to spy on computer users, but one of the simplest is the "key 
									logger". Key loggers are programs that record every keystroke made by the user.</p>
<p>Any reasonably expert user can set up a logger to output to a hidden file, or a file 
									on a network drive. Some loggers can send their output to a distant machine over the 
									Internet.</p>
<p>Loggers are simple enough things, in essence. The only subtlety in them lies in making 
									them as undetectable and unkillable as possible, so users don't know the 
									logger's there, 
									and can't turn it off even if they do know. Key loggers have also evolved into more advanced 
									products that monitor what people click on and pretty much everything else they do with 
									their computer. These so-called "activity loggers" are more useful, these days, 
									to spy on 
									complex multitasking machines for which keyboard input is often secondary.</p>
<p>There are some people who have good reason to use key loggers. Financial institutions 
									and military organisations, for instance. For law-enforcement people, activity loggers 
									are the computer equivalent of phone taps.</p>
<p>Lots of people with less clear-cut reasons to use loggers do as well. For some employers, 
									key loggers fit in with security cameras and e-mail monitoring as elements of what's 
									usually referred to by a euphemism like "employee evaluation". Obvious and not-so-obvious 
									privacy issues are raised by these policies. But I'm not going to talk about them. Because 
									I'm too busy playing with a new toy.</p>
<p class="Center"><a href="http://www.dansdata.com/images/keyghost/keyghost320.jpg">
<img alt="KeyGhost" height="113" src="http://www.dansdata.com/images/keyghost/keyghost160.jpg" width="160"/></a></p>
<p>It's called a KeyGhost, and it is the king of the key loggers.</p>
<p>A KeyGhost is a tiny gizmo that connects between an ordinary PC keyboard - AT or 
									PS/2 - and a computer, and records every keystroke. The KeyGhost Standard has enough 
									memory for 97,000 keystrokes; the more expensive KeyGhost Pro can store 500,000. They 
									need no batteries, they need no software installed, and they'll work on any PC. You 
									can plug them into one computer to record and into another to play back, if you like.</p>
<p>The KeyGhost Standard sells for $US139, the KeyGhost Professional for $US249, from 
									the manufacturers, New Zealand outfit <a href="http://www.keyghost.com/">Working Technologies</a>.</p>
<p>It may look simple, but it's not. The makers claim that very nearly all of the little 
									microcontroller's eight kilobytes of ROM is taken up, with code compiled from nearly 
									120 kilobytes of source.</p>
<p>To retrieve recorded data from a KeyGhost, you type in its secret password - which 
									defaults to "#keyghost", but can be changed to whatever you want. Now, a "ghost" types 
									out a menu, as you watch:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Main menu &gt;</p>
<p>1) Download entire log<br/>
										2) Download section of log<br/>
										3) Erase log<br/>
										4) Optimize speed<br/>
										5) Password change<br/>
										6) Format memory chip<br/>
										7) Arrows keys include<br/>
										8) eXit</p>
<p>Select or [space] to exit &gt;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You need to be in some sort of text editor - a word processor will do - to interact 
									with KeyGhost once you've fed it its password. It works in exactly the same way as an 
									old terminal-based computer system, with everything you type, or KeyGhost outputs, just 
									being appended to the growing document.</p>
<h3>The invisible KeyGhost</h3>
<p>The regular KeyGhosts are hard enough to spot. They're just a little cable extension 
									with a cylindrical case in the middle, and they'll hide easily behind any computer. 
									The upcoming <a href="http://www.keyghost.com/kgmini_ea.htm">KeyGhost Mini</a> is particularly 
									insidious - it can look like a normal keyboard extension cable, or like an AT-to-PS/2 
									or PS/2-to-AT plug adaptor.</p>
<p>But these KeyGhosts can be disabled easily enough, by simply unplugging them from 
									the keyboard cable, and plugging it straight into the computer. The plug-adaptor KeyGhost 
									Mini can, of course, just be replaced with a normal plug adaptor.</p>
<p>The hardest to spot (and disable) KeyGhosts are the Security Keyboards, which have 
									a KeyGhost built into the keyboard case.</p>
<p>The regular Security Keyboard is a plain PS/2 PC keyboard with a KeyGhost Standard 
									or Professional built in. For $US50 more than the ordinary KeyGhost prices you get an 
									ordinary straight keyboard; for $US60 more you can have a Microsoft Natural Keyboard 
									with your KeyGhost built in.</p>
<p>I checked out the plain Security Keyboard, with a KeyGhost Professional.</p>
<p class="Center"><a href="http://www.dansdata.com/images/keyghost/keyboard320.jpg">
<img alt="Ordinary innocent keyboard" height="99" src="http://www.dansdata.com/images/keyghost/keyboard160.jpg" width="160"/></a></p>
<p>There's absolutely nothing about the Security Keyboard to suggest that it's anything 
									other than a perfectly ordinary keyboard. It's got the same soft-touch, low-noise rubber 
									dome keyswitches in it as every other ordinary 'board these days, it's got the normal 
									complement of Windows keys; there's absolutely no reason to suspect there's anything 
									amiss, unless you unscrew the case and have a good look.</p>
<p class="Center"><a href="http://www.dansdata.com/images/keyghost/kgopen320.jpg">
<img alt="Keyboard open" height="115" src="http://www.dansdata.com/images/keyghost/kgopen160.jpg" width="160"/></a></p>
<p>There are two obvious screws, and no fewer than 11 other ones hidden under little 
									stick-on rubber foot things. Take all of 'em out, though, and it's easy enough to open 
									the 'board.</p>
<p class="Center"><a href="http://www.dansdata.com/images/keyghost/thingy0320.jpg">
<img alt="Keyghost unit" height="122" src="http://www.dansdata.com/images/keyghost/thingy0160.jpg" width="160"/></a></p>
<p>Inside, a casual observer wouldn't see anything amiss - but there's a little heat-shrink-covered 
									bundle spliced into the keyboard's cable.</p>
<p class="Center"><a href="http://www.dansdata.com/images/keyghost/thingy1320.jpg">
<img alt="Keyghost unit" height="84" src="http://www.dansdata.com/images/keyghost/thingy1160.jpg" width="160"/></a></p>
<p>Slice open the heatshrink and the KeyGhost board is revealed. </p>

<a href="http://www.atmel.com/atmel/postscript/first_page/doc1496a.gif">AT45D041A</a> four-megabit Flash memory chip - four megabits is half a megabyte, hence the half-million 
									character memory. </p>

<a href="http://www.microchip.com/10/Lit/PICmicro/16F87X/30292/index1.htm">PIC16F876</a>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PIC_microcontroller">microcontroller</a>, along with a little

<a href="http://www.fairchildsemi.com/pf/CD/CD4066BC.html">CD4066BCM</a> quad bilateral 
									switch.</p>
<p>If this were <i>truly</i> a covert-ops naughty-boy device, all of the semis would 
									have their markings ground off, and the little circuit board would be cocooned in a 
									blob of potting compound. Actually, I'm informed by Working Technologies that current 
									KeyGhosts <i>do</i> have the Flash chip's markings removed, to make it harder for people 
									who don't have the password, but do have some skill with electronics, to read the log.
									</p>
<h3><a name="update"></a>UPDATE!</h3>
<p>I wrote this review way back in 2000. Some time in 2005, somebody decided to use 
									the above section of the review, including the pictures, in a hoax story about "Dell 
									Keyloggers". The story alleges that the above hardware was being hidden in Dell laptops, 
									and who knows where else, at the order of the US Department of Homeland Security.</p>
<p>This is, of course, nonsense. But as of early 2009 the bogus story is still
									<a href='http://www.google.com/search?&amp;q="was opening up my almost brand new Dell 600m laptop"'>
									all over the Web</a>, sometimes in the
									<a href="http://virus.org.ua/unix/keylog/klog.htm" rel="nofollow">deluxe edition</a> 
									that includes my pictures too. There's
									<a href="http://www.snopes.com/computer/internet/dellbug.asp">a Snopes page</a> about 
									it, as well.</p>
<p>And now, back to the original review.</p>
<h3>Installation</h3>
<p>Unlike software key logging systems, the KeyGhost can be installed on password protected 
									machines, on BIOS locked machines, on powered-down machines, or, indeed, on any machine 
									to which you have five seconds of physical access. The Security Keyboard's no good for 
									surreptitious installation unless your target's too dozy to notice a keyboard change 
									- but tipping coffee on his old keyboard and bringing him the KeyGhost one when he complains 
									could do the trick. All of the little in-line KeyGhosts are ideally suited to "invisible" 
									installation.</p>
<p>And there's no way to get rid of the KeyGhost without physically removing it. 
									You 
									can swap the computer's whole hard drive for a new one and KeyGhost will still remember everything 
									it heard before, and keep happily recording away.</p>
<h3>Using it</h3>
<p>In operation, the KeyGhost is as simple as it sounds. Plug it in, use it, it's a 
									normal keyboard. Run a text editor and enter the unlock code, though, and up comes the 
									menu. Now, you can squirt out all or part of the log into your editor, clear the log, 
									or do a few housekeeping tasks.</p>
<p>The password can be up to 16 characters long and use any normal ASCII characters, 
									so it's easy to make it something that nobody's 
									<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_monkey_theorem">ever</a> going to type by accident.</p>
<p>You can also change the speed at which the KeyGhost "types" - it can be slowed down 
									for compatibility with older machines, or set to maximum speed for faster results on 
									modern PCs. It doesn't output terribly fast at the best of times; it can't spit much 
									more than 5.5 kilobytes of data per minute down the keyboard cable, so dumping the whole 
									half-megabyte memory of a KeyGhost Pro would take an hour and a half.</p>
<p>Half a million keystrokes is rather a lot, though. It's at least 80,000 words - 
									about 160 pulp-paperback pages. How long it'd take the average computer user to fill 
									the KeyGhost Pro memory, I don't know - different people doing different jobs input 
									data at different speeds - but even the 97,000-keystroke KeyGhost Standard would probably 
									have enough space for several days of input from most people. If you need more, Working 
									Technologies also have special super-capacity models with one- or four-<i>million-</i>keystroke memories.</p>
<p>Decoding some stuff from a KeyGhost log dump is like reassembling shredded documents. 
									Spreadsheet work, for instance, will look deeply cryptic; the KeyGhost records arrow 
									key presses (although you can tell it not to, if you want), so figuring out what was 
									done might be slightly less excruciating, but it's still the kind of thing you'd only 
									bother doing if you were trying to catch Carlos the Jackal's financiers or figure out 
									which employee bilked the company out of a million bucks last year.</p>
<p>But it's trivial to search a KeyGhost log dump for keywords - the name of your chief 
									competitor, a password your employee shouldn't know, names of known associates of the 
									suspect who doesn't know the fuzz has KeyGhosted every machine in the Internet cafe 
									he visits when he sends e-mail to his confederates.</p>
<h3>Overall</h3>
<p>The KeyGhost is a powerful snooping tool. Like most powerful snooping tools, it can 
									be used to do good things, and bad things.</p>
<p>Key loggers are a dead easy way to make an end run around password-protected systems. 
									And a hardware-based key logger like the KeyGhost means you just need a few seconds 
									to plug the thing in. Connect it, come back later and retrieve it, plug it into another 
									computer at your leisure, dump the log to a file, and search for the username. If you 
									don't know the username, you can scan through the file visually - even a prolific typist 
									isn't going to generate <i>that</i> much text per day - or take advantage of the fact 
									that the KeyGhost records power-on or Control-Alt-Delete combinations as "&lt;PWR&gt;".</p>
<p>Right after a &lt;PWR&gt; is usually a good place to look for a username, and right after 
									the username, you'll find the password.</p>
<p>Again, there are people who have a legitimate use for gadgets with such capabilities 
									- criminal investigators, chiefly. And there are other, perfectly innocent applications 
									for an incorruptible data store like this - professional writers, for instance, can 
									use it as a real-time backup device from which they can extract their copy even if their 
									hard drive detonates after a week of un-backed-up typing. It's likely to be a lot less 
									useful for programmers, though, since all of the hopping around involved in coding means 
									that decoding a simple serial keystroke dump is likely to be a great deal harder than 
									just writing the code again.</p>
<p>Frankly, the more I think about the legal and ethical issues surrounding gadgets 
									like this, the harder I find it to figure out whether they're a good thing or not. But 
									the genie's out of the bottle; the KeyGhost is a complicated little item, but it's not 
									as if it took a multinational corporation a hundred years to design. There's no way 
									these gizmoes could be stamped out even if all of the world's governments decided to 
									do it. So we're going to have to live with them, whether we like 'em or not.</p>
<p>Observed objectively - as a tool to do a job - the KeyGhost is a great product. The 
									price isn't outrageous, the memory capacity is ample, and it's easy to use. If you need 
									a keystroke logger, you'll love this one.</p>

<h3>Software monitors</h3>
<p>There are plenty of activity monitors for current operating systems -
									<a href="http://www.tamos.com/privacy/files/hookdump.zip">Hook Dump</a>, for instance, 
									is one of the better free ones for Windows 95/98  . It's easy to find
									<a href="http://tucows.com/search.html?search_scope=win&amp;tree_id=&amp;cost=&amp;tag=&amp;search_terms=keylogger&amp;search_type=soft">pages</a> and
									<a href="http://www.homepages.hetnet.nl/~maken/keyloggers.htm">pages</a> of other loggers, 
									monitors and similar security-related packages, though.</p>
<p>Some loggers record the logged keystrokes as the original keyboard "scancodes", not 
									the translated <a href="http://foldoc.doc.ic.ac.uk/foldoc/foldoc.cgi?query=ascii">ASCII</a> 
									that gets displayed on the screen; this lets you use whatever keymap you like for the 
									output, making the logger easily useable with international and specialised key layouts. 
									It also makes the output file harder to identify.</p>
