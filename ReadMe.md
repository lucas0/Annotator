# Current Issues to be fixed/changed/added:

## views.py:

1) Finish newOrigin function and ajax post functions.

2) Some source_lists give "ValueError: malformed node or string: None" when using ast.literal._eval(). Might be fixed by solving issue 3 in previous section.

3) Redirect when user is done annotating all.
