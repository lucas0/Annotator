     Shannon could hear the footsteps behind her as she walked toward     <br/>
 home. The thought of being followed made her heart beat faster.     <br/>
"You're being silly," she told herself, "no one is following you."  To be safe     <br/>
she began to walk faster, but the footsteps kept up with her pace.  She was     <br/>
afraid to look back and she was glad she was almost home.  Shannon said a quick prayer, "God please keep me safe."   She saw the porch light burning    <br/>
and ran the rest of the way to her house.<br/> <br/>
Once inside she leaned against the door for a moment, relieved to be in the safety of her home.  She glanced out the window to see if anyone was there.  The sidewalk was empty.<br/> <br/>
  After tossing her books on the sofa she decided to grab a snack and get on line.  There she could talk to strangers without being afraid.  After all, no one knew who she really was and couldn't hurt her. <br/> <br/>
She logged on under her screen name ByAngel213.  Checking her Buddy List she saw GoTo123 was on.  She sent him an instant message:<br/> </font><font color="#FF0000"><font face="comic sans ms"> <br/>
ByAngel213:</font><font color="#000000"><font face="comic sans ms">Hi I'm glad you are on!  I thought someone was following me home today. It was really weird!    </font><br/><font face="comic sans ms"><font color="#OOOOFF"> <br/>
GoTo123: </font><text><font face="comic sans ms"> LOL You watch too much TV.  Why would someone be following you?  Don't you live in a safe neighborhood?  </font></text><font face="comic sans ms"><br/><font color="#FFOOOO"> <br/>
ByAngel213:</font><text><font face="comic sans ms">  Of course I do…  LOL…  I guess it was my imagination… cause I didn't see anybody when I looked out.  </font></text><br/> <font color="#OOOOFF"> <br/>
GoTo123:</font><text><font face="comic sans ms"> Unless you gave your name out on line… You haven't done that have you?  </font></text><font face="comic sans ms"><br/><font color="#FFOOOO"> <br/>
ByAngel213:</font><text><font face="comic sans ms"> Of course not. I'm not stupid you know. </font></text> <br/><font color="#OOOOFF"> <br/>
GoTo123 </font><text>:Did you have a softball game after school today?  </text><br/><font color="#FFOOOO"> <br/>
ByAngel213:</font><text><font face="comic sans ms"> Yes and we won!!   </font></text><br/> <font color="#OOOOFF"> <br/>
GoTo123:</font><text> That's great! Who did you play? </text><br/><font color="#FFOOOO"> <br/>
ByAngel213:</font><text><font face="comic sans ms"> We played the Hornets… LOL..their uniforms are so gross! They look like bees… LOL   </font></text><br/> <font color="#OOOOFF"> <br/>
GoTo123:</font><text>What is your team called?    </text><br/><font color="#FFOOOO"> <br/>
ByAngel213:</font><text><font face="comic sans ms">We are the Canton Cats.  We have tiger paws on our uniforms. They are really kewl. </font></text><br/> <font color="#OOOOFF"> <br/>
GoTo123:</font><text> Do you pitch or what?  </text><br/><font color="#FFOOOO"> <br/>
ByAngel213:</font><text><font face="comic sans ms"> No… I play second base. I've got to go..  My homework has to be done before my parents get home.  I don't want them mad at me…Bye </font></text><br/> <font color="#OOOOFF"> <br/>
GoTo123::</font><text> Catch you later.. <p> <br/>
      GoTo123 decided it was time to teach Angel a lesson.  One she would never forget.  He went to the member menu and began to search for her profile.  When it came up he highlighted it and printed it out.  He took out a pen and began to write down what he knew about Angel so far.        <br/>
</p><ul> <br/>
<li>Her name: Shannon         <br/>
</li><li>Birthday: Jan.3, 1985 age:13         <br/>
</li><li>State where she lived: North Carolina          <br/>
</li><li>Hobbies: softball, chorus, skating and going to the mall.</li></ul> <br/>
     Besides this information he knew she lived in Canton.  She had just told him that.  He knew she stayed by herself until 6:30 every afternoon until her parents came home from work.<br/> <br/>
     He knew she played softball on Thursday afternoons on the school team and the team was named the Canton Cats.  Her favorite number 7 was printed on her jersey.  He knew she was in the seventh grade at the Canton Junior High School.<br/> <br/>
    She had told him all this in the conversations they had on line.  He had enough information to find her now. "She'll be so surprised," he thought, "she doesn't even know what she has done." <br/> <br/>
     Shannon didn't tell her parents about the incident on the way home from the ball park that day.  She didn't want them to make a scene and stop her from walking home from the softball games.  Parents were always overreacting and hers were the worst.  It made her wish she was not an only child.  Maybe if she had brothers and sisters her parents wouldn't be so overprotective. <br/> <br/>
     By Thursday Shannon had forgotten about the footsteps following her. Her game was in full swing when suddenly she felt someone staring at her.  It was then the memory came back.  She glanced up from her second base position to see a man watching her closely.  He was leaning against the fence behind first base and he smiled when she looked at him.  He didn't look scary and she quickly dismissed the fear she had felt. <br/> <br/>
     After the game he sat on a bleacher while she talked to the coach.  She noticed his smile once again as she walked past him.  He nodded and she smiled back.  He noticed her name on back of the shirt.  He knew he had found her.  Quietly he walked a safe distance behind her.  He didn't want to frighten her and have to explain what he was doing to anyone. <br/> <br/>
     It was only a few blocks to Shannon's home and once he saw where she lived he quickly returned to the park to get his car. Now he had to wait.  He decided to get a bite to eat until the time came to go to Shannon's house.  He drove to a fast food restaurant and sat there until time to make his move. <br/> <br/>
     Shannon was in her room later that evening when she heard voices in the living room. "Shannon, come here," her father called.  He sounded upset and she couldn't imagine why.  She went into the room to see the man from the ballpark sitting on the sofa.<br/> <br/>
"Sit down," her father began, "this man is a retired policeman and he has just told us a most interesting story about you." <br/> Shannon moved cautiously to a chair across from the man.  How could he tell her parents anything?  She had never seen him before today! <br/> <br/>
"Do you know who I am Shannon?" The man asked.<br/> <br/>
"No…" Shannon answered.<br/> <br/>
"I am your on line friend, GoTo123." <br/> <br/>
     Shannon was stunned. "That's impossible!  GoTo is a kid my age!  He's 14 and he lives in Michigan!" <br/> <br/>
     The man smiled. "I know I told you all that… but it wasn't true.  You see Shannon there are people on line who pretend to be kids; I was one of them.  But while others do it to find kids and hurt them, I belong to a group of parents who do it to protect kids from predators. I came here to find you to teach you how dangerous it is to give out too much information to people on line.  You told me enough about yourself to make it easy for me to find you... your name, the school you went to, the name of your ball team and the position you played.  The number and name on your jersey just made finding you a breeze." <br/> <br/>
Shannon was stunned. "You mean you don't live in Michigan?"<br/> <br/>
He laughed. "No, I live in Raleigh.  It made you feel safe to think I was so far away, didn't it?"<br/> She nodded.<br/> <br/>
"I had a friend whose daughter was like you.  Only she wasn't as lucky.  The guy found her and murdered her while she was home alone.  Kids are taught not to tell anyone when they are alone, yet they do it all the time on line. <br/> <br/>
  The wrong people trick you into giving out information a little here and there on line. Before you know it, you have told them enough for them to find you without even realizing you have done it.  I hope you've learned a lesson from this and won't do it again." <br/> <br/>
"I won't," Shannon promised solemnly. <br/> <br/>
"Will you tell others about this so they will be safe too?" <br/> <br/>
"It's a promise!" <br/> <br/>
 That night Shannon told her parents about thinking someone had followed her home the week before. They listened quietly as she assured them it had been her imagination, but she promised to tell them if anything like that happened again.Then tears formed in her eyes as she recalled the prayer she had prayed. <br/><br/>
"You know," she said solemnly, "I asked God to keep me safe and He really has, hasn't He?" <p> <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So, how much are you telling your on line friends?  Could someone find you if they wanted to?  How much do you really know about them?        <br/>

**The story you just read was not true. Yet it could have happened;  it was based on true information given out to me by kids on line. It could easily happen to the teens that chat so freely with strangers. While it is not meant to frighten you, it is a lesson in being safe.This message is for boys as well as girls. They have been victims of predators on line too. The following are ways to protect yourself :         <br/>
</font></p><ul><font face="comic sans ms"> <br/>
<li> Never tell anyone your full name, address, phone number, city or any other personal information about yourself or your family.         <br/>
<br/>
</li><li>  Watch what you put on your profile.  Don't put your date of birth, especially the year.  Remember you are not required to put any information on the profile you don't want to.        <br/>
<br/>
</li><li>  If anyone IM's you or e-mails you and asks where you go to school, where you live or any other personal questions you don't feel comfortable with, do not hesitate to say, " I'm sorry, I don't give out personal information" or  "My parents have asked me not to tell that."        <br/>
<br/>
</li><li> If someone sends you a e-mail form with personal information about themselves on it and suggests you fill one out just like it, be alerted and don't do it.  Who knows to where and to whom it will be forwarded!        <br/>
<br/>
</li><li> If you go into chat rooms and anyone pressures you to talk to them, won't leave you alone or asks for personal information,    <br/>
leave the room immediately!        <br/>
<br/>
</li><li> If you ever get suggestive, angry or abusive messages tell your parents at once and contact the Internet provider you use and seek assistance.        <br/>
<br/>
</li><li> Don't respond to e-mail from people you don't know.   If you believe you've received something strange, tell your parents.        <br/>
<br/>
</li><li> Never agree to meet anyone face-to-face that you have talked with online.        <br/>
<br/>
</li></font></ul><font face="comic sans ms"><br/>
Most importantly of all:  HAS ANY OF THIS ALREADY HAPPENED TO YOU???  If it has this is a great time to tell your parents.  You may also write us with any questions or suggestions at<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20000614091102/mailto:TeenFocus@aol.com"> TeenFocus@aol.com</a> or <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20000614091102/mailto:TeenFocus1@aol.com">TeenFocus1@aol.com</a> <br/>

<br/>
  We are two mature dedicated Christians who have a real concern for the safety of young people online.  We have recently witnessed several instances where young people have given out or been asked to give out all kinds of personal information.  The people asking for this information were strangers.  Because of this we have formed a group called, (TeenFocus).  We hope to send out a newsletter on a regular basis with all kinds of fun and safe things young people can participate in on the Web.          <br/>
    In the world of the Internet - people can say they are anyone they want and none of us have any way of knowing who they really are.  We want to help you.  Please print this out and show it to your parents and forward it to any  friends you think may benefit from it.        <br/>
