SEC. 11028. RELIEF FOR 2016 DISASTER AREAS.

    (a) In General.--For purposes of this section, the term ``2016 
disaster area'' means any area with respect to which a major disaster 
has been declared by the President under section 401 of the Robert T. 
Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act during calendar 
year 2016.
    (b) Special Rules for Use of Retirement Funds With Respect to Areas 
Damaged by 2016 Disasters.--
            (1) Tax-favored withdrawals from retirement plans.--
                    (A) In general.--Section 72(t) of the Internal 
                Revenue Code of 1986 shall not apply to any qualified 
                2016 disaster distribution.
                    (B) Aggregate dollar limitation.--
                          (i) In general.--For purposes of this 
                      subsection, the aggregate amount of distributions 
                      received by an individual which may be treated as 
                      qualified 2016 disaster distributions for any 
                      taxable year shall not exceed the excess (if any) 
                      of--
                                    (I) $100,000, over
                                    (II) the aggregate amounts treated 
                                as qualified 2016 disaster distributions 
                                received by such individual for all 
                                prior taxable years.
                          (ii) Treatment of plan distributions.--If a 
                      distribution to an individual would (without 
                      regard to clause (i)) be a qualified 2016 disaster 
                      distribution, a plan shall not be treated as 
                      violating any requirement of this title merely 
                      because the plan treats such distribution as a 
                      qualified 2016 disaster distribution, unless the 
                      aggregate amount of such distributions from all 
                      plans maintained by the employer (and any member 
                      of any controlled group which includes the 
                      employer) to such individual exceeds $100,000.
                          (iii) Controlled group.--For purposes of 
                      clause (ii), the term ``controlled group'' means 
                      any group treated as a single employer under 
                      subsection (b), (c), (m), or (o) of section 414 of 
                      the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
                    (C) Amount distributed may be repaid.--
                          (i) In general.--Any individual who receives a 
                      qualified 2016 disaster distribution may, at any 
                      time during the 3-year period beginning on the day 
                      after the date on which such distribution was 
                      received, make one or more contributions in an 
                      aggregate amount not to exceed the amount of such 
                      distribution to an eligible retirement plan of 
                      which such individual is a beneficiary and to 
                      which a rollover contribution of such distribution 
                      could be made under section 402(c), 403(a)(4), 
                      403(b)(8), 408(d)(3), or 457(e)(16) of the 
                      Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as the case may be.
                          (ii) Treatment of repayments of distributions 
                      from eligible retirement plans other than iras.--
                      For purposes of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, 
                      if a contribution is made pursuant to clause (i) 
                      with respect to a qualified 2016 disaster 
                      distribution from an eligible retirement plan 
                      other than an individual retirement plan, then the 
                      taxpayer shall, to the extent of the amount of the 
                      contribution, be treated as having

                      received the qualified 2016 disaster distribution 
                      in an eligible rollover distribution (as defined 
                      in section 402(c)(4) of the Internal Revenue Code 
                      of 1986) and as having transferred the amount to 
                      the eligible retirement plan in a direct trustee 
                      to trustee transfer within 60 days of the 
                      distribution.
                          (iii) Treatment of repayments for 
                      distributions from iras.--For purposes of the 
                      Internal Revenue Code of 1986, if a contribution 
                      is made pursuant to clause (i) with respect to a 
                      qualified 2016 disaster distribution from an 
                      individual retirement plan (as defined by section 
                      7701(a)(37) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986), 
                      then, to the extent of the amount of the 
                      contribution, the qualified 2016 disaster 
                      distribution shall be treated as a distribution 
                      described in section 408(d)(3) of such Code and as 
                      having been transferred to the eligible retirement 
                      plan in a direct trustee to trustee transfer 
                      within 60 days of the distribution.

                      taxable year, any amount required to be included 
                      in gross income for such taxable year shall be so 
                      included ratably over the 3-taxable-year period 
                      beginning with such taxable year.

    (d) &lt;&lt;NOTE: 26 USC 168 note.&gt;&gt;  Normalization Requirements.--
            (1) In general.--A normalization method of accounting shall 
        not be treated as being used with respect to any public utility 
        property for purposes of section 167 or 168 of the Internal 
        Revenue Code of 1986 if the taxpayer, in computing its cost of 
        service for ratemaking purposes and reflecting operating results 
        in its regulated books of account, reduces the excess tax 
        reserve more rapidly or to a greater extent than such reserve 
        would be reduced under the average rate assumption method.
            (2) Alternative method for certain taxpayers.--If, as of the 
        first day of the taxable year that includes the date of 
        enactment of this Act--
                    (A) the taxpayer was required by a regulatory agency 
                to compute depreciation for public utility property on 
                the basis of an average life or composite rate method, 
                and
                    (B) the taxpayer's books and underlying records did 
                not contain the vintage account data necessary to apply 
                the average rate assumption method,
        the taxpayer will be treated as using a normalization method of 
        accounting if, with respect to such jurisdiction, the taxpayer 
        uses the alternative method for public utility property that is 
        subject to the regulatory authority of that jurisdiction.
            (3) Definitions.--For purposes of this subsection--
                    (A) Excess tax reserve.--The term ``excess tax 
                reserve'' means the excess of--
                          (i) the reserve for deferred taxes (as 
                      described in section 168(i)(9)(A)(ii) of the 
                      Internal Revenue Code of 1986) as of the day 
                      before the corporate rate reductions provided in 
                      the amendments made by this section take effect, 
                      over
                          (ii) the amount which would be the balance in 
                      such reserve if the amount of such reserve were 
                      determined by assuming that the corporate rate 
                      reductions provided in this Act were in effect for 
                      all prior periods.
                    (B) Average rate assumption method.--The average 
                rate assumption method is the method under which the 
                excess in the reserve for deferred taxes is reduced over 
                the remaining lives of the property as used in its 
                regulated books of account which gave rise to the 
                reserve for deferred taxes. Under such method, during 
                the time period in which the timing differences for the 
                property reverse, the amount of the adjustment to the 
                reserve for the deferred taxes is calculated by 
                multiplying--
                          (i) the ratio of the aggregate deferred taxes 
                      for the property to the aggregate timing 
                      differences for the property as of the beginning 
                      of the period in question, by

[[Page 131 STAT. 2100]]

                          (ii) the amount of the timing differences 
                      which reverse during such period.
                    (C) Alternative method.--The ``alternative method'' 
                is the method in which the taxpayer--
                          (i) computes the excess tax reserve on all 
                      public utility property included in the plant 
                      account on the basis of the weighted average life 
                      or composite rate used to compute depreciation for 
                      regulatory purposes, and
                          (ii) reduces the excess tax reserve ratably 
                      over the remaining regulatory life of the 
                      property.
            (4) Tax increased for normalization violation.--If, for any 
        taxable year ending after the date of the enactment of this Act, 
        the taxpayer does not use a normalization method of accounting 
        for the corporate rate reductions provided in the amendments 
        made by this section--
                    (A) the taxpayer's tax for the taxable year shall be 
                increased by the amount by which it reduces its excess 
                tax reserve more rapidly than permitted under a 
                normalization method of accounting, and
                    (B) such taxpayer shall not be treated as using a 
                normalization method of accounting for purposes of 
                subsections (f)(2) and (i)(9)(C) of section 168 of the 
                Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
