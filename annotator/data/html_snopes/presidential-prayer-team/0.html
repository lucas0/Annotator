						Like many Christian leaders, you have a vision for your organization. You have sought the Lord, and He has called you to fulfill a great vision. It is a vision founded in serving and glorifying Him.<br/>
<br/>
						Now comes the hard part.<br/>
<br/>
						It is time to build the vision with discipline, hard work, and perseverance. It is time to bring clarity, expertise and precision to the vision. Time to trust God to provide the people and resources needed to share your vision.<br/>
<br/>
						An envoy is an expertly trained courier who brings a special message from a higher source to an audience. It is our privilege and our calling to help deliver your ministry message -- your vision -- to the marketplace.<br/>
<br/>
<font size="5"><i><b>Your Trust is Our Cornerstone<br/>

						with our clients, our staff and our associates.<br/>
<br/>
<font size="5"><br/>
						WHO WE ARE<br/>

<br/>
						The Envoy Group's experienced professionals have a keen understanding of the importance of developing an organization's brand, helping them to eliminate or jump over the barriers they've experienced in the past that are limiting their potential.

<br/>
						Envoy Group executives are Christians who seek to glorify God in all that they do. With a commitment to excellence, these men and women put their training and experience to work to further the goals of their clients and the Kingdom.
