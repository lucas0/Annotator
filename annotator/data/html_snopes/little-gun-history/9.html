<div class="j12f2l0r0t1" id="h0-1">The second amendment to the Constitution
of the United States recognizes that "[a] well regulated militia being
necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep
and bear arms shall not be infringed."<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn1" name="fnb1"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn1" name="fnb1"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn1" name="fnb1"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn1" name="fnb1">[1]</a>
That there is controversy surrounding the interpretation of the second
amendment, or any provision of the Bill of Rights, is hardly surprising.
While the disputes relating to the first, fourth and remaining amendments
focus upon their detailed application, the conflict over the second amendment
concerns the question of its very subject matter. One school of thought
contends that the second amendment protects a collective right, a narrow
guarantee of a state right to maintain organized reserve military units.<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn2" name="fnb2"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn2" name="fnb2"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn2" name="fnb2"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn2" name="fnb2">[2]</a>
This interpretation emphasizes the phrase "A well regulated militia being
necessary to a free state," and maintains that the subsequent recognition
of the people's right to bear arms is a mere restatement of this collective
(i.e., state) right. The other school of thought contends that the amendment
recognizes an individual right to possess and use arms.<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn3" name="fnb3"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn3" name="fnb3"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn3" name="fnb3"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn3" name="fnb3">[3]</a>
This interpretation emphasizes <font size="-1">(p.2)</font>the phrase "the
right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed," and
maintains that the preceding description of the militia (i.e., all individuals
capable of armsbearing) is a mere explanation of one objective of this
guarantee.<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn4" name="fnb4"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn4" name="fnb4"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn4" name="fnb4"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn4" name="fnb4">[4]</a></div>
<div id="h0-2">The works of neither school entertain the possibility that
an "either/or" test may be a gross oversimplification of what are in fact
two different sets of constitutional priorities. Yet the fact that prior
to 1788 the Framers who proposed protections for individuals' arms did
not propose to protect the militia, and those desirous of protecting the
militia did not propose safeguards of individual arms, suggests the quixotic
nature of previous attempts to demonstrate that the Framers, as a whole,
had a single intent. Is it reasonable to assume that John Adams, obsessed
with the risk of mob rule, and Thomas Jefferson, who so lightly praised
the virtues of frequent revolutions, were of a single mind when it came
to popular armaments? When Virginia constitutionalized the principle that
a well-regulated militia was necessary to the proper defense of a free
state, and Pennsylvania instead guaranteed that the people had a right
to bear arms for defense of themselves and the state, was there in fact
<font size="-1">(p.3)</font>an
identical understanding which motivated each statement? Both existing formulations
of the second amendment require us to assume precisely that. As a consequence,
no existing analysis of that amendment has attempted a critical examination
of the proposals for the second amendment against the varied backgrounds
and philosophies of their authors, and none has taken account of recent
research demonstrating that the different state conventions were dominated
by radically differing political philosophies.</div>
<p id="h0-3">It is the purpose of this article to suggest that in fact
<i>neither</i>
the collective nor individual school of thought is correct insofar as it
claims to <i>entirely</i> explain the second amendment, and
<i>both</i>
are correct, insofar as they purport to offer partial explanations. The
second amendment was not intended to recognize only a single principle;
rather, like the first, fourth, fifth, and sixth amendments, it was intended
as a composite of constitutional provisions. Its militia component and
its right to bear arms recognition have in fact different origins and theoretical
underpinnings. One is a legacy of the Renaissance, brought to fruition
by the "Classical Republicans;" the other is the creation of seventeenth
century English experience, brought to fruition in the Enlightenment. At
the time of the framing of our Constitution, the militia statement found
its primary constituency among the gentry, particularly that of Virginia.
The individual right to bear arms provision was primarily advanced by the
Radical movement, particularly in Pennsylvania and Massachusetts. Only
after the Constitution had received its crucial ninth ratification were
the two precepts joined into a single sentence, thereby creating a constitutional
"package" which addressed the demands of both schools of thought. Thus
neither the militia nor the right to bear arms provision can be taken in
isolation as a sufficient explanation of the second amendment, a fact made
obvious by the first Congress' retention of both clauses during its extensive
paring of Madison's proposals.<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn5" name="fnb5"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn5" name="fnb5"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn5" name="fnb5"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn5" name="fnb5">[5]</a>
The second amendment therefore has historical <font size="-1">(p.4)</font>interest
which extends beyond militia and arms issues. It is, metaphorically speaking,
a fault line in the bedrock of the Constitution; the one place where a
rough joinder of related ideas enables us today to discern a turning point
between two entirely different American approaches to statecraft.

</p><p id="h0-4">To be sure, militia systems and individual armament have always
been related concerns with a practical interaction. An armed citizenry
was the basis of the militia the Framers sought, and the functioning of
such a militia was the most obvious <i>political</i> purpose of citizen
armament. Such an interaction is hardly unique; the first amendment guarantees
freedom of expression and the right to petition the legislature. At the
same time, neither of the interrelated rights can fully express the purposes
of the Framers. Indeed, the overlap between the militia concept and the
right to arms concept has not prevented a certain rivalry between the two,
a rivalry especially pronounced during the formative years of our own nation.
Supporters of one view may not have disputed the principle of the other,
but they certainly disputed whether it deserved high political-constitutional
priority.

</p><p id="h0-5">One group, influenced by the Classical Republicans, saw the
establishment of a stable republic that could survive in a hostile environment
as the highest priority. For this group, to emphasize citizens' rights
<i>against</i>
such a republic was to place the cart before the horse. The other group,
influenced by Enlightenment thought, saw the establishment of the rights
of man, around which a free republic or democracy might be construed, as
the main priority. A statement, rather than a command, regarding the value
of the militia "to a free state" appealed to the first group; a command
that the right "of the people" to bear arms shall not be infringed appealed
to the second.

</p><p id="h0-6">In order to fully understand <i>both</i> purposes of the second
amendment it will be necessary to examine first the origins of the militia
concept, second, the origins of an individual right to bear arms, and third,
the eventual merger of the two concepts which led to the present second
amendment.<font size="-1">(p.5)</font>

<b>I. The Militia as Essential to a Free Republic</b></h2>
<h3 class="l12f0l2r0t1" id="h1.1">
<b>A. A Digression: Modern Historiography, the Classical Republicans and
the Radicals</b></h3>
<div class="j12f2l0r0t1" id="h1.1-1">Only a few decades ago, the ideology
of the American Revolution could have been neatly summarized as a commentary
on John Locke's <i>First Treatise on Civil Government</i>. While acknowledging
that more state-centered Republicans emerged during the seventeenth century
(largely as a result of the English Civil War and the Protectorate of Oliver
Cromwell which followed), this view assumes that their ideas had been discredited
in the late seventeenth century and were disregarded in the eighteenth.<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn6" name="fnb6"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn6" name="fnb6"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn6" name="fnb6"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn6" name="fnb6">[6]</a>
Thus before Locke there was nothing, so far as the theoretics of the Framers
were concerned.</div>
<div id="h1.1-2">Recent research has forced a reevaluation of this view,
suggesting both that Locke's role was overstated<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn7" name="fnb7"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn7" name="fnb7"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn7" name="fnb7"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn7" name="fnb7">[7]</a>
and that eighteenth century American thought was heavily influenced by
pre-Lockean republican views.<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn8" name="fnb8"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn8" name="fnb8"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn8" name="fnb8"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn8" name="fnb8">[8]</a>
These "Classical Republicans" (largely identified with the Whig Party)
contributed greatly to late eighteenth century American political thought.
Although largely forgotten today, the names of eminent Republicans such
as Sidney, Harrington and Fletcher were commonplace to the Framers and
their contemporaries.<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn9" name="fnb9"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn9" name="fnb9"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn9" name="fnb9"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn9" name="fnb9">[9]</a>
Indeed, modern students of this movement maintain that the <font size="-1">(p.6)</font>Framers
were immersed in Classical Republican thought:</div>
<blockquote>
<div class="j11f0l0r0t1" id="h1.1-3">No man's thought is altogether free.
Men are born into an intellectual universe where some ideas are native
and others are difficult to conceive. Sometimes this intellectual universe
is so well structured and has so strong a hold that it can virtually determine
not only the ways in which a society will express its hopes and discontents
but also the central problems with which it will be concerned. In 1789
Americans lived in such a world. The heritage of classical republicanism
and English opposition thought, shaped and hardened in the furnace of a
great Revolution, left few men free.<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn10" name="fnb10"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn10" name="fnb10"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn10" name="fnb10"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn10" name="fnb10">[10]</a></div>
</blockquote>
<div class="j12f2l0r0t1" id="h1.1-4">Yet the rediscoverers of Classical
Republican thought did not have the last word in the effort to discern
the political thought of the Framers. The seventeenth century had its Populists
and Democrats (the Diggers and the Levelers) and one of the effects of
the Classical Republican emphasis has been the study of their counterparts
(albeit not direct descendants), the Radical thinkers of revolutionary
America.<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn11" name="fnb11"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn11" name="fnb11"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn11" name="fnb11"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn11" name="fnb11">[11]</a>
However unappealing such radicalism may have been to the gentry, its values
and thought explain the stance of Sam Adams, Thomas Paine, and the urban
patriots of Boston and Philadelphia to a far greater degree than the Classical
Republicans' emphasis on agrarian, freeholding society. Moreover, since
one of the Radical legacies was an emphasis on individual rights, as distinguished
from the Classical Republicans' emphasis on a well-ordered society, their
thought is of special relevance to our Bill of Rights, not to mention the
Jeffersonian/Jacksonian democracy of the early republic.</div>
<div id="h1.1-5">To be sure, when we speak of Republicans and Democrats,
Conservatives and Radicals, we do so in a quite subjective manner. Few,
if any, statesmen of 1787-1791 would have admitted to being anything but
a "Republican." Indeed, those whom we would view as "Radicals" today were
among the most ardent supporters of "Republicanism." Few would have cared
to be called "Radical." These terms of art thus have little relation to
how the labelled individuals described themselves at the time. Moreover,
to categorize so <font size="-1">(p.7)</font>varied a band of thinkers is
to understate the diversity of their thought and impose upon that group
a particular perspective. The views of Jefferson, the agrarian Radical,
differed subtly from those of Sam Adams, the urban Radical; neither man
would have cared for too close an association with the views of Sam's aristocratic
cousin, John Adams. Richard Henry Lee and Elbridge Gerry, both ardent Republicans,
are to our eyes hardly compatriots of Carter Braxton, the reluctant revolutionary
and Monarchist. Yet all these otherwise disparate individuals put their
names to the Declaration of Independence, and all (whether Monarchist or
Democrat, Conservative or Radical) would have been similarly Radical to
a Tory of the time. Recognizing these limitations, it is still plausible
to distinguish between "Conservative Revolutionaries" such as George Mason,
and their Radical brethren such as Sam Adams, and between those who gave
priority to establishing a stable republic and those who gave priority
to defining and guaranteeing rights against even such a government.</div>
<h3 class="l12f0l2r0t1" id="h1.2">
<b>B. The Free State and a Well Regulated Militia</b></h3>
<div class="j12f2l0r0t1" id="h1.2-1">The existence of an English militia,
comprised not of specialized units but of essentially the entire male population,
far antedates even the Norman Conquest.<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn12" name="fnb12"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn12" name="fnb12"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn12" name="fnb12"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn12" name="fnb12">[12]</a>
By 1181, every English freeman was required annually to prove ownership
of arms proportionate to his landholdings.<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn13" name="fnb13"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn13" name="fnb13"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn13" name="fnb13"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn13" name="fnb13">[13]</a>
In 1253, even serfs were required to prove annually that they owned a spear
and dagger.<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn14" name="fnb14"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn14" name="fnb14"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn14" name="fnb14"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn14" name="fnb14">[14]</a>
Subsequent enactments ordered all healthy Englishmen to own longbows, to
train their sons in archery from age seven, and to abstain from a variety
of outdoor sports that diverted commoners from the archery ranges.<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn15" name="fnb15"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn15" name="fnb15"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn15" name="fnb15"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn15" name="fnb15">[15]</a>
By the fifteenth century, Englishmen already regarded universal armament
for national defense as a critical element in their development of "government
under law."<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn16" name="fnb16"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn16" name="fnb16"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn16" name="fnb16"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn16" name="fnb16">[16]</a>
This perception of citizen armament as <font size="-1">(p.8)</font>a peculiarly
English virtue was thereafter reinforced by the rise of royal absolutism
on the Continent,<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn17" name="fnb17"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn17" name="fnb17"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn17" name="fnb17"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn17" name="fnb17">[17]</a>
with consequent limitation on firearm possession in France and the Empire.
Long after her continental counterparts had banned or severely restricted
firearms ownership,<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn18" name="fnb18"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn18" name="fnb18"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn18" name="fnb18"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn18" name="fnb18">[18]</a>
Elizabeth still struggled to stop her subjects from drawing pistols in
church, or firing them in the churchyard.<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn19" name="fnb19"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn19" name="fnb19"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn19" name="fnb19"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn19" name="fnb19">[19]</a></div>
<div id="h1.2-2">While the results of citizen armament may thus have been
annoying to sundry clerics, they did much to restrain excessive royal power.
An English king had to remember that his "'gentleman pensioners' and his
yeoman of the guard were but a handful, and bills or bows were in every
farm and cottage."<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn20" name="fnb20"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn20" name="fnb20"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn20" name="fnb20"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn20" name="fnb20">[20]</a>
Conversely, a popular monarch could count upon a massive reserve army,
maintained at little or no cost to the state: in the 1580s, Elizabeth could
maintain <font size="-1">(p.9)</font>120,000 men on duty throughout the summer.<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn21" name="fnb21"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn21" name="fnb21"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn21" name="fnb21"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn21" name="fnb21">[21]</a>
Such a force was almost entirely for defensive use because, since the twelfth
century, English kings had relied upon mercenaries for foreign military
service.<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn22" name="fnb22"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn22" name="fnb22"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn22" name="fnb22"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn22" name="fnb22">[22]</a>
Mercenaries were not tied to a home district; they were better trained
and, while on the offensive, could be compensated by plunder. But after
the loss of British holdings in France during the mid-fifteenth century,
England stood mainly on the defensive, and mercenary forces dwindled to
a handful of bodyguards and coastal garrisons.</div>
<div id="h1.2-3">This decline paralleled an expansion and perfection of
the militia system under the late Tudors.<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn23" name="fnb23"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn23" name="fnb23"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn23" name="fnb23"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn23" name="fnb23">[23]</a>
The system all but collapsed under the reign of the pacifistic James I,
who acquiesced in the repeal of the militia statutes. The civil war which
came during the reign of his son, Charles I, saw both sides dependent upon
standing armies (sometimes equipped by disarming local militias). The end
result of the war was a military dictatorship.<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn24" name="fnb24"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn24" name="fnb24"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn24" name="fnb24"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn24" name="fnb24">[24]</a>
The dictatorship ended in turn with the restoration of Charles II, who
restored only a limited royalist militia backed by standing forces. This
turmoil predictably inspired various theoreticians to suggest various ideal
political systems. Unlike many thinkers from that period in history, the
Classical Republicans, who drew inspiration largely from the Greek and
Roman republics, left an enduring legacy.</div>
<p id="h1.2-4">To the early Classical Republicans, the militia concept
was more than simple tradition. The belief that such a militia was "necessary
to a free State" soon became central to their political thought. They drew
inspiration from Nicolo Machiavelli, who had both explained and attempted
to implement a national militia centuries before. Writing to an Italy which
had seen its city-states and their mercenary armies crushed in detail by
French and Spanish professionals, Machiavelli advocated an Italian nation,
led by a popular prince and based on a national militia. Such a prince,
he explained, would found his state upon: "good laws and good arms. And
as there can not be good laws where there are not good arms, and where
there <font size="-1">(p.10)</font>are good arms there must be good laws,
I will not now discuss the laws, but will speak of the arms."<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn25" name="fnb25"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn25" name="fnb25"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn25" name="fnb25"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn25" name="fnb25">[25]</a>
Mercenaries were to be categorically condemned; they were "disunited, ambitious,
without discipline, faithless, bold amongst friends, cowardly amongst enemies,
they have no fear of God, and keep no faith with men."<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn26" name="fnb26"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn26" name="fnb26"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn26" name="fnb26"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn26" name="fnb26">[26]</a>
These faults were inherent in all mercenaries; their lack of patriotism
left no motivation beyond wages, which were not enough to motivate men
to die.<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn27" name="fnb27"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn27" name="fnb27"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn27" name="fnb27"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn27" name="fnb27">[27]</a>
More fundamentally, any mercenary army powerful enough to defend a state
must be more than powerful enough to subjugate it.<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn28" name="fnb28"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn28" name="fnb28"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn28" name="fnb28"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn28" name="fnb28">[28]</a>
According to Machiavelli, only a nation defended by a militia can escape
this dilemma: "Rome and Sparta were for many centuries well armed and free.
The Swiss are well armed and enjoy great freedom."<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn29" name="fnb29"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn29" name="fnb29"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn29" name="fnb29"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn29" name="fnb29">[29]</a>
</p><p id="h1.2-5">The great Florentine expanded these themes in his <i>Art
of War</i>. A prince who relies upon mercenaries must either remain embroiled
in wars, or risk overthrow when mercenaries become unemployed with the
advent of peace.
</p><blockquote>
<div class="j11f0l0r0t1" id="h1.2-6">A prince, therefore, who would reign
in security, ought to select only such men for his infantry as will cheerfully
serve him in war when it is necessary, and be as glad to return home when
it is over. This will always be the case with those who have other occupations
and employments by which to live.<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn30" name="fnb30"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn30" name="fnb30"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn30" name="fnb30"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn30" name="fnb30">[30]</a></div>
</blockquote>
<div class="j12f0l0r0t1" id="h1.2-7">Such a militia stabilizes the state,
whatever its form:</div>
<blockquote>
<div class="j11f0l0r0t1" id="h1.2-8">it is certain that no subjects or
citizens, when legally armed and kept in due order by their masters, ever
did the least mischief to any state ... Rome remained free for four hundred
years and Sparta eight hundred, although their citizens were armed all
that time; but many other states that have been disarmed have lost their
liberties in less than forty years.<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn31" name="fnb31"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn31" name="fnb31"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn31" name="fnb31"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn31" name="fnb31">[31]</a><font size="-1">(p.11)</font></div>
</blockquote>
<div class="j12f2l0r0t1" id="h1.2-9">Knowledge of Machiavelli's writings
spread rapidly. An English translation of his <i>Art of War</i> went through

yet long before the translations his writings were common currency among
the English statesmen.<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn33" name="fnb33"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn33" name="fnb33"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn33" name="fnb33"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn33" name="fnb33">[33]</a>
Machiavelli's greatest impact upon English thought came, however, through
the writings of James Harrington. Harrington applied Machiavelli's <i>realpolitik</i>
to seventeenth century England, substituting a republic of freeholders
for rule by a popular prince. The outcome was a stable republic populated,
ruled and defended by a militia of its freeholders.<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn34" name="fnb34"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn34" name="fnb34"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn34" name="fnb34"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn34" name="fnb34">[34]</a>
Ownership of land gives independence; unlike a feudal landholder, the modern
freeholder owns in fee simple, is not obliged as a condition of tenure
to fight for a superior, and thus can defend his own rights and interests.</div>
<blockquote>
<div class="j11f0l0r0t1" id="h1.2-10">[T]he power whose distributics in
society [Harrington] was trying to chart was essentially the possession
of land that gave a man independence, this independence being in the last
analysis measured by his ability to bear arms and use them in his own quarrels.
Harrington's democracy was a republic of freeholders owning their own lands
and weapons....<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn35" name="fnb35"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn35" name="fnb35"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn35" name="fnb35"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn35" name="fnb35">[35]</a></div>
</blockquote>
<div class="j12f0l0r0t1" id="h1.2-11">Indeed, Harrington's rejection of
monarchy is intertwined with his belief that land, political power and
military force must be in the same hands:</div>
<blockquote>
<div class="j11f0l0r0t1" id="h1.2-12">Harrington's entire theory of monarchy
can be reduced to two propositions: first, that the King's agents and servants
must be supported either upon the land as a feudal aristocracy, or about
his person, as praetorians or janissaries; second, that whichever of these
methods is adopted, relations between the military class and the King will
be so prone to tensions that monarchy can never be a stable form of government.<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn36" name="fnb36"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn36" name="fnb36"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn36" name="fnb36"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn36" name="fnb36">[36]</a><font size="-1">(p.12)</font></div>
</blockquote>
<div class="j12f0l0r0t1" id="h1.2-13">This, Harrington argued, could be
contrasted to his stable republic where property, political power, and
arms were all in the same hands. Such a republic faced few internal threats,
since those with arms also had the greatest economic and political interest
in maintaining the state. Nor were external threats to be feared:</div>
<blockquote>
<div class="j11f0l0r0t1" id="h1.2-14">inasmuch as, the commonwealth being
equal, [an invader] must needs to find them united, but in regard that
such citizens, being all soldiers or trained up unto their arms, which
they use not for the defense of slavery but of liberty (a condition not
in this world to be bettered), they have more especially upon this occasion
the highest soul of courage and (if their territory be of any extent) the
vastest body of a well disciplined militia that is possible in nature.
Wherefore an example of such an one overcome by the arms of a monarch,
is not to be found in the world ... [F]or the reasons why a government
of citizens ... is the hardest to be held, there needs no more than that
men accustomed unto their arms and their liberties will never endure the
yoke.<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn37" name="fnb37"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn37" name="fnb37"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn37" name="fnb37"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn37" name="fnb37">[37]</a></div>
</blockquote>
<div class="j12f2l0r0t1" id="h1.2-15">Harrington wrote during the Protectorate,
when efforts to maintain a standing army were indeed destabilizing the
nation. After 1660, the army played a different role, that of maintaining
royal power. Harrington's postulate that an army could not be adequately
financed and subordinated was compromised. Harrington's followers, particularly
Henry Neville, modified his critique. Whereas Harrington had assumed a
standing army could not stabilize a government, good or bad, Neville and
other post-1675 Harringtonians saw it as all too capable of stabilizing
an autocratic one.<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn38" name="fnb38"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn38" name="fnb38"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn38" name="fnb38"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn38" name="fnb38">[38]</a>
Conversely, by arming the people at large democracies could obtain an incomparable
advantage: "democracy is much more powerful than aristocracy, because the
latter cannot arm the people for fear they could seize upon the government."<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn39" name="fnb39"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn39" name="fnb39"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn39" name="fnb39"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn39" name="fnb39">[39]</a>
Harrington's followers also recast his utopia in a conservative light,
by arguing that traditional English practices had in fact been republican.
"The arming and training of all the freeholders of England, as it is our
undoubted <font size="-1">(p.13)</font>ancient Constitution, and consequently
our Right," argued Robert Molesworth, "so it is the Opinion of most Whigs,
that it ought to be out in Practice."<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn40" name="fnb40"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn40" name="fnb40"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn40" name="fnb40"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn40" name="fnb40">[40]</a>
Thus the Classical Republicans ultimately cast the militia not only as
part of the republican utopia but also an underpinning of the existing
English constitution.</div>
<h3 class="l12f0l2r0t1" id="h1.3">
<b>C. The Standing Army Controversy</b></h3>
<div class="j12f2l0r0t1" id="h1.3-1">Yet as Harrington's successors refined
the argument for the militia vis-a-vis the standing army, they were being
overtaken by events. In 1688 James II relied upon his army, which was financed
out of his own personal funds rather than Parliamentary appropriations,
and staffed by handpicked officers. Too late, James discovered his mistake.
England was "invaded" by William of Orange, supported by some 12,000 troops.
Although James mustered more than twice that number, dissension (particularly
among the officers) prevented James from offering battle, and he fled into
exile.<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn41" name="fnb41"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn41" name="fnb41"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn41" name="fnb41"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn41" name="fnb41">[41]</a></div>
<div id="h1.3-2">This "Glorious Revolution" and William and Mary's acceptance
of the throne offered by Parliament did nothing to reduce the support for
the standing army. For England to accept William also meant being drawn
into the ongoing struggle between Holland and France and facing the risk
of James' return with a French army. The need for the projection of force
on the continent had returned and, as always, the militia was totally unsuited
to this task.</div>
<div id="h1.3-3">English policy makers had to face several other realities,
none of which favored reliance on the militia. An invasion, if it came,
would be spearheaded by well-trained French troops, at a time when such
training was of increasing importance. Technical improvements over the
course of the seventeenth century had immensely complicated the role of
the average infantryman. At the beginning of the century, the customary
infantry weapons of musket or pike (an eighteen-foot spear held by men
formed in a dense mass) had required a moderate amount of training; an
army of that time <font size="-1">(p.14)</font>maneuvered slowly in "tercios"
or "battles" of about 3,000 men. During the first third of the seventeenth
century, armies were constructed around a "battalion" of about 500 men
trained to execute a multitude of orders: "officers became not merely leaders,
but trainers of men; diligent practice in peace-time, and in winter, became
essential; and drill, for the first time in modern history became the precondition
for the military success...."<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn42" name="fnb42"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn42" name="fnb42"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn42" name="fnb42"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn42" name="fnb42">[42]</a>
Conversely, the financial revolution of the 1690's, which saw the creation
of a national bank and acceptance of a national debt, made it possible
to fund a large enough standing force.<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn43" name="fnb43"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn43" name="fnb43"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn43" name="fnb43"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn43" name="fnb43">[43]</a>
Increasing tactical and economic sophistication were paralleled by the
realization of political means to guarantee legislative control of the
army. Parliament could keep a tight rein on the standing army by limiting
appropriations and enacting "Mutiny Acts" of intentionally short duration.<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn44" name="fnb44"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn44" name="fnb44"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn44" name="fnb44"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn44" name="fnb44">[44]</a></div>
<p id="h1.3-4">The increased viability of a true standing army suddenly
forced the post-1688 Whigs to face the prospect of becoming members of
the establishment they had formerly opposed.<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn45" name="fnb45"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn45" name="fnb45"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn45" name="fnb45"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn45" name="fnb45">[45]</a>
Some, like Molesworth, hedged:
</p><blockquote>
<div class="j11f0l0r0t1" id="h1.3-5">A Whig is against the raising or keeping
up a Standing Army in Time of Peace; but with this Distinction, that if
at any time an Army (tho even in Time of Peace) should be necessary to
the Support of the very Maxim, a Whig is not for being too hasty to destroy
that which is to be the Defender of his Liberty.<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn46" name="fnb46"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn46" name="fnb46"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn46" name="fnb46"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn46" name="fnb46">[46]</a><font size="-1">(p.15)</font></div>
</blockquote>
<div class="j12f0l0r0t1" id="h1.3-6">Others continued to defend the renaissance
ideal of the citizen-free holder-soldier, and argued that treating military
skills as a specialization would lead inevitably to tyranny and corruption.
While their views, as will be shown, gained great currency in America,
in England they became simply the "Opposition."<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn47" name="fnb47"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn47" name="fnb47"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn47" name="fnb47"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn47" name="fnb47">[47]</a></div>
<div id="h1.3-7">In the years after 1688, a standing army thus became more
acceptable to Englishmen, if not to their American counterparts. Macaulay
sums up the experience:</div>
<blockquote>
<div class="j11f0l0r0t1" id="h1.3-8">What had been at first tolerated as
an exception began to be considered as the rule. Not a session passed without
a mutiny bill, regarded merely as an occasion on which hopeful young orators
fresh from Christchurch were to deliver maiden speeches, setting forth
how the guards of Pisistratus seized the citadel of Athens, and how the
Praetorian cohorts sold the Roman empire to Didius. At length these declamations
became too ridiculous to be repeated. The most old fashioned, the most
eccentric, politician could hardly, in the reign of George the Third, contend
that there ought to be no regular soldiers....<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn48" name="fnb48"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn48" name="fnb48"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn48" name="fnb48"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn48" name="fnb48">[48]</a></div>
</blockquote>
<div class="j12f2l0r0t1" id="h1.3-9">The acceptance of a standing army
was paralleled by the atrophy of the militia system in England. Indeed,
the rural disorders of the 1760s inspired fear in the gentry of the militia-trained
portion of the populace. Lord Barrington, for instance, feared that "a
few soldiers, commanded by a weak, ignorant subaltern, might be defeated
by a very large mob, full of men lately used to arms in the army and militia."<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn49" name="fnb49"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn49" name="fnb49"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn49" name="fnb49"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn49" name="fnb49">[49]</a>
The general militia in England was steadily supplanted by a select militia
which achieved efficiency by a sacrifice of almost every traditional attribute.
The 1761 Militia Act, for instance, authorized mustering of only a few
hundred men from each county. Those chosen were, if wealthy, able to hire
another to serve as a substitute; those actually serving were issued government
arms, stored by the officers under lock and key. The Lieutenant of the
county (or his deputies) was authorized "to employ such Person <font size="-1">(p.16)</font>or
Persons as he or they shall think fit, to seize and remove the arms, clothes
and accoutrements belonging to the militia, whenever [they] shall adjudge
it necessary to the peace of the kingdom...."<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn50" name="fnb50"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn50" name="fnb50"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn50" name="fnb50"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn50" name="fnb50">[50]</a>
It thus is no surprise that a few years later the Whig mayor of London
would inform Parliament that the militia "could no longer be deemed a constitutional
defence, under the immediate controul and direction of the people; for
by that bill they were rendered a standing army to all intents and purposes
whatever...."<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn51" name="fnb51"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn51" name="fnb51"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn51" name="fnb51"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn51" name="fnb51">[51]</a></div>

<b>II. The People's Right to Keep and Bear Arms</b></h2>
<div class="j12f2l0r0t1" id="h2-1">As noted above, Classical Republicanism
strongly influenced American revolutionary ideology. Nevertheless, while
the views of Harrington and Neville may go far toward explaining the outlook
of John Adams and George Mason, but they are less illuminating in explaining
the views of Sam Adams, Thomas Paine, Thomas Jefferson, and their fellows.</div>
<blockquote>
<div class="j11f2l0r0t1" id="h2-2">Alongside the Machievellian conception
of citizenship, order and liberty, there grew up another paradigm ....
Classical theory asserted the predominance of politics over all other aspects
of social life. In exactly the way Pocock has described the creation of
all matrices of language, [eighteenth century] writers decomposed old meanings
about civil order and recomposed the elements of time, citizenship, and
the distribution of authority. Outside the [classical] polity, they constructed
a model of economic life that borrowed its order from nature--the newly
conceptualized nature of predictable regularity. As the economy absorbed
more and more of the attention of men and women it supplied a new identity
for them. By the end of the eighteenth century the individual with wide-ranging
needs and abstract rights appeared to challenge the citizen with concrete
obligations and prescribed privileges.</div>
<div class="j11f2l0r0t0" id="h2-3">In the 1790's, when the Jeffersonian
Republicans and Federalists confronted each other, the battle lines had
been drawn around opposing conceptions of civil society.<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn52" name="fnb52"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn52" name="fnb52"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn52" name="fnb52"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn52" name="fnb52">[52]</a><font size="-1">(p.17)</font></div>
</blockquote>
<div class="j12f2l0r0t1" id="h2-4">Although Anglo-Saxon society had long
placed particular emphasis on the individual, especially toward property,<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn53" name="fnb53"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn53" name="fnb53"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn53" name="fnb53"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn53" name="fnb53">[53]</a>
the concept of individual political rights was of relatively late birth.
To print a work on politics or religion required a royal permit as late
as 1695.<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn54" name="fnb54"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn54" name="fnb54"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn54" name="fnb54"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn54" name="fnb54">[54]</a>
Most colonies retained the permit requirement into the 1730's;<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn55" name="fnb55"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn55" name="fnb55"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn55" name="fnb55"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn55" name="fnb55">[55]</a>
even after these measures lapsed, it was illegal to print a work reflecting
on an action of Parliament or the person of a member without prior authorization.<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn56" name="fnb56"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn56" name="fnb56"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn56" name="fnb56"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn56" name="fnb56">[56]</a>
The 1661 Act Against Tumultuous Petitioning prohibited petitioning the
King or Parliament for changes in the established law, absent a permit
from a justice of the peace.<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn57" name="fnb57"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn57" name="fnb57"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn57" name="fnb57"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn57" name="fnb57">[57]</a>
The 1673 Test Act, which generally barred non-Anglicans from civil or military
office, remained on the books until 1829;<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn58" name="fnb58"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn58" name="fnb58"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn58" name="fnb58"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn58" name="fnb58">[58]</a>
searches based on general warrants, issued by the executive, were <font size="-1">(p.18)</font>universally
accepted until the 1760s.<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn59" name="fnb59"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn59" name="fnb59"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn59" name="fnb59"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn59" name="fnb59">[59]</a>
Most of our Bill of Rights are, in short, of quite recent vintage. It should
therefore come as no surprise that the concept of a right to keep and bear
arms has a later point of origin than that of the militia. Conversely,
a specifically individual right to arms, separate and apart from the militia
system, was one of the earliest of the <i>individual</i> civil rights to
gain acceptance.</div>
<div id="h2-5">In fact, the origins of the concept of an individual right
to arms lies not in the eighteenth century Enlightenment, but in the turmoil
of the seventeenth century. As Joyce Malcolm has demonstrated,<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn60" name="fnb60"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn60" name="fnb60"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn60" name="fnb60"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn60" name="fnb60">[60]</a>
Englishmen of all classes and loyalties were shocked when, hard pressed
for arms at the outset of the English Civil War, both Royal and Parliamentary
forces disarmed suspected opponents and even supporters.<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn61" name="fnb61"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn61" name="fnb61"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn61" name="fnb61"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn61" name="fnb61">[61]</a>
The end of the fighting brought no end to the risk. In 1659, the Protectorate
for the first time gave formal statutory authorization to disarm Englishmen
<i>en
masse</i>: officials were authorized to search for and seize all arms possessed
by veterans of the Royal armies or by "any other person whom the Commissioners
shall judge dangerous to the peace of the Commonwealth."<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn62" name="fnb62"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn62" name="fnb62"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn62" name="fnb62"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn62" name="fnb62">[62]</a>
Nor were supporters of the Commonwealth safe for long. The following year,
the Commonwealth fell and Charles II was restored to the throne. One of
his first acts was to order the Lords Lieutenant of the militia to disarm
all likely opponents. The <i>Calendar of State Papers</i> summary of his
order ends: "officers to be numerous, disaffected persons watched and not
allowed to assemble, and their arms seized."<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn63" name="fnb63"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn63" name="fnb63"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn63" name="fnb63"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn63" name="fnb63">[63]</a></div>
<div id="h2-6">The order was executed so zealously as to antagonize even
Charles' supporters. The failure of his attempts to secure a comprehensive
<font size="-1">(p.19)</font>militia
bill in 1661 is primarily attributable to resentments aroused among members
of the royalist Restoration Parliament.<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn64" name="fnb64"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn64" name="fnb64"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn64" name="fnb64"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn64" name="fnb64">[64]</a>
Only after strenuous effort was Charles able in 1662 to secure passage
of a suitable Militia Act. The 1662 Act broadly authorized actions which
Charles had previously undertaken by prerogative. Rather than draw its
membership from the entire body of the people, the militia was to be a
limited, organized group of Royalists;<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn65" name="fnb65"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn65" name="fnb65"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn65" name="fnb65"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn65" name="fnb65">[65]</a>
most critically for the purposes of this article, the Lieutenants and their
deputies were to "search for And seize all Arms in the custody or possession
of any person or persons whom the said Lieutenants or any two or more of
their deputies shall judge dangerous to the peace of the Kingdom...."<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn66" name="fnb66"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn66" name="fnb66"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn66" name="fnb66"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn66" name="fnb66">[66]</a>
In support of these provisions, gunsmiths and carriers were ordered by
proclamation to file weekly reports on firearms sold and transported.<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn67" name="fnb67"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn67" name="fnb67"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn67" name="fnb67"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn67" name="fnb67">[67]</a>
Furthermore, in 1671, the Hunting Act was amended to restrict arms possession
by all but the landed gentry. The Hunting Acts had long barred all but
the relatively wealthy from ownership of hunting implements, such as traps,
nets and hunting dogs. The 1671 Act added all firearms to the list of contraband,
and extended the ban to all persons not owning lands with an annual rental
value exceeding 100 pounds sterling.<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn68" name="fnb68"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn68" name="fnb68"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn68" name="fnb68"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn68" name="fnb68">[68]</a>
Anyone possessing property with greater value was authorized to search
residences for weapons on his own initiative.<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn69" name="fnb69"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn69" name="fnb69"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn69" name="fnb69"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn69" name="fnb69">[69]</a>
Both Charles and his successor, James II, vigorously implemented these

In December 1686, James issued duplicate orders to six Lords Lieutenant
of the militia, stating that he was <font size="-1">(p.20)</font>informed
"that a great many persons not qualified by law under pretense of shooting
matches keep muskets or other guns in their houses" and that they should
instruct their deputies "to cause strict search to be made for such muskets
or guns and to seize and safely keep them till further order."<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn71" name="fnb71"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn71" name="fnb71"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn71" name="fnb71"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn71" name="fnb71">[71]</a>
The searches were intended to keep the Anti-Royalists under control and
on the defensive.<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn72" name="fnb72"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn72" name="fnb72"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn72" name="fnb72"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn72" name="fnb72">[72]</a>
The reconstituted Royalist militia was used for enforcement, and sometimes
engaged in mass searches.<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn73" name="fnb73"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn73" name="fnb73"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn73" name="fnb73"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn73" name="fnb73">[73]</a></div>
<p id="h2-7">As noted above, neither such disarmaments nor James' personally-financed
standing army were sufficient to sustain him in power. James lost his throne
but retained his head, for the 1688 Glorious Revolution<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn74" name="fnb74"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn74" name="fnb74"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn74" name="fnb74"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn74" name="fnb74">[74]</a>
was accomplished without a single fatality. Parliament, meeting on its
own initiative as a "convention," formulated a "Declaration of Rights"
which William and Mary, its nominees, were required to accept prior to
taking the throne.<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn75" name="fnb75"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn75" name="fnb75"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn75" name="fnb75"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn75" name="fnb75">[75]</a>
The Declaration was intended to reflect the very core of traditional English
rights which must be observed in the future; it embodied only the most
indisputable and critical rights.<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn76" name="fnb76"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn76" name="fnb76"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn76" name="fnb76"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn76" name="fnb76">[76]</a>
A century later, an American Congress would use much of the Declaration
as a basis for an American bill of rights.<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn77" name="fnb77"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn77" name="fnb77"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn77" name="fnb77"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn77" name="fnb77">[77]</a><font size="-1">(p.21)</font>
</p><p id="h2-8">The Parliamentary debates over the Declaration mark the first
acceptance of an indisputably individual right to keep and bear arms. The
debates in the House of Commons<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn78" name="fnb78"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn78" name="fnb78"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn78" name="fnb78"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn78" name="fnb78">[78]</a>
show that arms confiscations under the Militia Act were a widespread grievance.
Sir Richard Temple, for example, criticized the militia bill as containing
the power to disarm all England.<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn79" name="fnb79"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn79" name="fnb79"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn79" name="fnb79"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn79" name="fnb79">[79]</a>
Mr. Boscawen's crucial speech focused upon the oppressive acts of Parliament
as well as those of the King.<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn80" name="fnb80"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn80" name="fnb80"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn80" name="fnb80"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn80" name="fnb80">[80]</a>
Sergeant Maynard<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn81" name="fnb81"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn81" name="fnb81"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn81" name="fnb81"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn81" name="fnb81">[81]</a>
complained that "an Act of Parliament was made to disarm all Englishmen,
whom the lieutenant should suspect, by day or by night, by force or otherwise."<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn82" name="fnb82"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn82" name="fnb82"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn82" name="fnb82"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn82" name="fnb82">[82]</a>
Others seconded his complaints of oppressive enactments before Maynard
returned to the floor:
</p><blockquote>
<div class="j11f0l0r0t1" id="h2-9">Some particulars well propounded--Some
gross grievances for which we are beholden to a Parliament, who care not
what was done, so their pensions were paid.--Militia Act--an abominable
thing to disarm the nation, to set up a standing army--Corporation Act
carried into execution with a high hand.<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn83" name="fnb83"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn83" name="fnb83"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn83" name="fnb83"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn83" name="fnb83">[83]</a><font size="-1">(p.22)</font></div>
</blockquote>
<div class="j12f0l0r0t1" id="h2-10">The House of Commons voted out a Declaration,
in the form of a list of grievances and parallel rights. The list of grievances
included a statement that "The Acts concerning the militia are grievous
to the subjects." Although this would clearly focus upon the rights of
the individual, or "subject," Commons clouded the issue in the rights recognitions
of its draft: "[T]he Subjects which are Protestants, should provide and
keep arms for the common defense; and that the arms which have been seized
and taken from them be restored."<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn84" name="fnb84"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn84" name="fnb84"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn84" name="fnb84"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn84" name="fnb84">[84]</a>
The House of Lords found this combination of individual right and remedy
with a collective purpose unacceptable. The grievance section of Commons'
draft was altered into a general indictment of James' policies. He had
endeavored "to subvert and extirpate" the "laws and liberties of this kingdom"
by, inter alia, "causing several good subjects, being protestants, to be
disarmed, at the same time when papists were both armed and employed contrary
to law."<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn85" name="fnb85"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn85" name="fnb85"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn85" name="fnb85"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn85" name="fnb85">[85]</a>
The second passage was even more profoundly altered. The "common defense"
proviso was replaced with a recognition that individuals might possess
arms "for their defense." The Lords declared: "For the vindicating and
asserting their ancient rights and liberties.... [t]hat the subjects, which
are protestants, may have arms for their defense suitable to their conditions
and as allowed by law."<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn86" name="fnb86"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn86" name="fnb86"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn86" name="fnb86"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn86" name="fnb86">[86]</a>
Lest there be confusion over the "as allowed by law" proviso, Parliament
promptly amended the Hunting Acts to delete firearms from the list of contraband.<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn87" name="fnb87"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn87" name="fnb87"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn87" name="fnb87"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn87" name="fnb87">[87]</a>
The House of Commons paralleled this with an amendment to the Militia Act
which <font size="-1">(p.23)</font>repealed all power to seize firearms;
unfortunately, the bill was lost in the House of Lords when William dissolved
Parliament.<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn88" name="fnb88"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn88" name="fnb88"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn88" name="fnb88"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn88" name="fnb88">[88]</a>
Nevertheless, its provisions were soon incorporated into colonial militia
statutes.<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn89" name="fnb89"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn89" name="fnb89"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn89" name="fnb89"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn89" name="fnb89">[89]</a></div>
<div id="h2-11">The Lords' changes, which prevailed in conference, thus
emphasized the individual character of the right to arms. The final form
of the Declaration does not so much as mention the militia. Standing armies
are mentioned, but the objection is only that they were maintained "without
consent of Parliment;" a purely royal army is contrary to law, one created
by Parliment is quite consistent with the Constitution.</div>
<div id="h2-12">The Declaration in turn formed the core of the following
century's conception of individual rights. In his famed <i>Commentaries</i>,
Blackstone discussed the absolute rights of life, liberty and property,
and the auxiliary rights which protect them. After discussing such auxiliary
rights as those to petition and to legal process he concluded, in words
which would have been read and re-read by Jefferson, Madison and almost
any colonist with a claim to constitutional insight:</div>
<blockquote>
<div class="j11f0l0r0t1" id="h2-13">The fifth and last auxiliary right
of the subject, that I shall at present mention, is that of having arms
for their defense, suitable to their condition and degree and as allowed
by law. Which is also declared by the same Statute 1 W&amp;M s. 2 c.2 and
is indeed a public allowance under due restrictions, of the natural right
of resistance and self preservation, when the sanctions of society and
the laws are found insufficient to restrain the violence of oppression.<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn90" name="fnb90"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn90" name="fnb90"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn90" name="fnb90"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn90" name="fnb90">[90]</a></div>
</blockquote>
<div class="j12f2l0r0t1" id="h2-14">In brief, it is apparent that the common
law recognized an individual right to keep and bear arms, and that this
was separate and apart from the related concept (whether or not it be considered
a "collective" or an "individual right") that a militia was an especially
appropriate way of defending a free republic. The "collective/individual"
<font size="-1">(p.24)</font>distinction
was not unknown at this point, but Englishmen approached it by stressing
that their system endorsed <i>both</i> concepts. As the Recorder of London
noted, when called upon to determine the legality of privately-established
military reserve units:</div>
<blockquote>
<div class="j11f0l0r0t1" id="h2-15">The right of his majesty's Protestant
subjects, to have arms for their own defense, and to use them for lawful
purposes, is most clear and undeniable. It seems, indeed, to be considered,
by the ancient laws of this kingdom, not only as a right, but as a duty
... And that this right, which every Protestant most unquestionably possesses
individually, may, and in many cases must, be exercised collectively, is
likewise a point which I conceive to be most clearly established by the
authority of judicial decisions and ancient acts of Parliment, as well
as by reason and common sense.<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn91" name="fnb91"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn91" name="fnb91"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn91" name="fnb91"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn91" name="fnb91">[91]</a></div>

<b>III. The Militia and the Rights to Arms in Pre-Revolutionary America</b></h2>
<h3 class="l12f0l2r0t1" id="h3.1">
<b>A. Decline of the Militia System</b></h3>
<div class="j12f2l0r0t1" id="h3.1-1">While the militia as an institution
declined in Britain during the eighteenth century,<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn92" name="fnb92"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn92" name="fnb92"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn92" name="fnb92"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn92" name="fnb92">[92]</a>
it retained vitality in the colonies. Unlike the mother country, the colonies
lacked both the need to project military force beyond their borders, and
an economy which could support a significant standing force. The colonists
quickly adapted the militia system to Indian conflicts, instituting rapid
response units and long-range patrols.<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn93" name="fnb93"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn93" name="fnb93"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn93" name="fnb93"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn93" name="fnb93">[93]</a>
They also assimilated the views of the English Whigs and Classical Republicans,<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn94" name="fnb94"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn94" name="fnb94"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn94" name="fnb94"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn94" name="fnb94">[94]</a>
with their stress upon the militia's role in a free republic.<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn95" name="fnb95"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn95" name="fnb95"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn95" name="fnb95"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn95" name="fnb95">[95]</a>
To Harrington, an army was too unstable to support any government; to Neville,
it was so stable as to support a tyrannical one; to many colonists, it
was capable of corrupting a republican government into a tyranny. Had not
James Burgh, their favorite Whig,<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn96" name="fnb96"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn96" name="fnb96"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn96" name="fnb96"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn96" name="fnb96">[96]</a>
laid their troubles with the mother <font size="-1">(p.25)</font>country
at the feet of the English standing army?<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn97" name="fnb97"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn97" name="fnb97"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn97" name="fnb97"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn97" name="fnb97">[97]</a>
The Revolution's origins reinforced these views. The most critical preparation
for the conflict came in 1774, when revolutionaries took over virtually
every colony's militia organization. The British attempts to raid militia
arsenals at Concord and Williamsburg ensured the alliance of Massachusetts
and Virginia and converted local grievances into a continental war.<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn98" name="fnb98"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn98" name="fnb98"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn98" name="fnb98"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn98" name="fnb98">[98]</a></div>
<div id="h3.1-2">The conclusion of the American Revolution left Americans
in a position similar to that of post-1689 English Whigs: the former opponents
were now in control. Many now found a limited standing army acceptable.
Hamilton later observed that exclusive dependence on the militia: "had
like to have cost us our independence.... The steady operations of war
against a regular and disciplined army can only be successfully conducted
by a force of the same kind."<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn99" name="fnb99"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn99" name="fnb99"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn99" name="fnb99"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn99" name="fnb99">[99]</a>
These views prevailed in the early republic: a small professional army
was kept afoot, and it was expanded as needed to meet sundry emergencies.<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn100" name="fnb100"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn100" name="fnb100"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn100" name="fnb100"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn100" name="fnb100">[100]</a>
As in post-1689 England, the standing army was denounced, <font size="-1">(p.26)</font>derided,
and retained.</div>
<div id="h3.1-3">The parallel Whig view, which stressed the desirability
of a true militia, had a longer lease on life. Pre-1789 American political
thought had stressed the need to enroll all citizens, or at least all free
holders, for militia duty, and had rejected any idea of a "select militia"
in which only a portion of the population was enrolled.<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn101" name="fnb101"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn101" name="fnb101"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn101" name="fnb101"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn101" name="fnb101">[101]</a>
Provisions authorizing Congress to provide for the arming and organizing
of the national militia were seen as allowing it to require that all citizens
possess arms of uniform caliber and conform to a standard of drill.<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn102" name="fnb102"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn102" name="fnb102"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn102" name="fnb102"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn102" name="fnb102">[102]</a>
In practice, while various administrations prepared detailed plans along
these lines, Congress refused to enact them.<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn103" name="fnb103"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn103" name="fnb103"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn103" name="fnb103"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn103" name="fnb103">[103]</a>
Washington's first annual address acknowledged: "[a] free people ought
not only to be armed, but disciplined; to which end a uniform and well-digested
plan is requisite."<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn104" name="fnb104"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn104" name="fnb104"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn104" name="fnb104"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn104" name="fnb104">[104]</a>
His second address courteously hinted that the "establishment of a militia"
was among the "subjects which I presume you will resume of course, and
which <font size="-1">(p.27)</font>are abundantly urged by their own importance."<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn105" name="fnb105"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn105" name="fnb105"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn105" name="fnb105"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn105" name="fnb105">[105]</a>
One year later, Washington again listed militia legislation as "a matter
of primary importance whether viewed in reference to the national security
to the satisfaction of the community or to the preservation of order."<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn106" name="fnb106"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn106" name="fnb106"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn106" name="fnb106"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn106" name="fnb106">[106]</a>
In 1792, Congress voted out the first (and, until 1903, the last) national
Militia Act.<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn107" name="fnb107"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn107" name="fnb107"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn107" name="fnb107"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn107" name="fnb107">[107]</a>
While this Act required all white males of military age to possess a rifle
or musket (or, if enrolled in cavalry or artillery units, pistols and a
sword), it did nothing to guarantee uniformity of calibers, fixed no standard
of national drill, and failed even to provide a penalty for noncompliance.
The subsequent presidential calls for detailed organization of a national
citizen army<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn108" name="fnb108"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn108" name="fnb108"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn108" name="fnb108"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn108" name="fnb108">[108]</a>
went unheeded. The original ideal of the militia thus ultimately went the
way of the standing army controversy: "The ideological assumptions of revolutionary
republicanism would no longer play an important role in the debate over
the republic's military requirements."<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn109" name="fnb109"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn109" name="fnb109"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn109" name="fnb109"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn109" name="fnb109">[109]</a></div>
<h3 class="l12f0l2r0t1" id="h3.2">
<b>B. The Dominance of the Right to Arms</b></h3>
<div class="j12f2l0r0t1" id="h3.2-1">Conversely, even as the republican
militia concept weakened throughout the eighteenth century, the concept
of an individual right to arms became more firmly entrenched in American
thought. To a great extent, this was a part of a larger intellectual movement.
The primary legacy of the 1689 settlement in England had been the supremacy
of Parliament. Bodin's maxim that in every government <font size="-1">(p.28)</font>there
must be a single, ultimate repository of sovereignty was accepted,<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn110" name="fnb110"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn110" name="fnb110"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn110" name="fnb110"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn110" name="fnb110">[110]</a>
and that repository was fixed as Parliament. While Parliament must heed
the "Constitution", the Constitution was (with apologies to a later Chief
Justice) what Parliament said it was.<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn111" name="fnb111"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn111" name="fnb111"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn111" name="fnb111"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn111" name="fnb111">[111]</a>
The colonists, whose initial conflict was with Parliament and not the King,<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn112" name="fnb112"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn112" name="fnb112"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn112" name="fnb112"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn112" name="fnb112">[112]</a>
necessarily had to take issue. One counter was to amplify the concept of
rights which existed somehow beyond the scope of <i>any</i> governmental
interference.</div>
<div id="h3.2-2">The most historical approach involved deriving such right
from common law. This involved accepting Coke's position that the common
law was immemorial and suprahuman, the product not of any one legislator
or legislative act, but of the collective intelligence and experience of
Englishmen over a millenium or more.<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn113" name="fnb113"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn113" name="fnb113"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn113" name="fnb113"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn113" name="fnb113">[113]</a>
Few dicta have had as great an impact on legal history as the equivocal
passage Coke slid into <i>Dr. Bonham's Case</i>:<font size="-1">(p.29)</font></div>
<blockquote>
<div class="j11f0l0r0t1" id="h3.2-3">And it appears in our books, that
in many cases, the common law will controul Acts of Parliament, and sometimes
adjudge them to be utterly void: for when an act of Parliament is against

<div id="h3.2-5">Derivation of a common law right to arms took little effort.
Even the earliest common law jurists had recognized a right to self-defense
and to the possession of arms for that purpose.<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn118" name="fnb118"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn118" name="fnb118"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn118" name="fnb118"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn118" name="fnb118">[118]</a>
The recognition of an individual right to arms in the 1689 Declaration
made the matter all but indisputable. The colonists took to heart Blackstone's
derivation of an individual right to arms from both these sources. When,
during the Stamp Act crisis, objection was raised to a call for all citizens
to procure arms, newspaper articles published throughout the colonies<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn119" name="fnb119"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn119" name="fnb119"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn119" name="fnb119"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn119" name="fnb119">[119]</a>

<blockquote>
<div class="j11f0l0r0t1" id="h3.2-6">It is a natural right which the people
have reserved to themselves, confirmed by the Bill of Rights, to keep arms

<div class="j12f0l0r0t1" id="h3.2-7">In similar vein, members of the Continental

<div id="h3.2-8">But the common law was not the only source of rights theory,
<font size="-1">(p.30)</font>particularly
when, after 1776, the conflict became one with the entire British system
and not merely Parliament.<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn122" name="fnb122"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn122" name="fnb122"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn122" name="fnb122"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn122" name="fnb122">[122]</a>
Some Americans reconciled their views with tradition by claiming that American
views were a purified common law which lacked later British corruptions.<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn123" name="fnb123"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn123" name="fnb123"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn123" name="fnb123"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn123" name="fnb123">[123]</a>

The major American thinkers were even bolder. Washington wrote with pride
that "the foundation of our empire was not laid in the gloomy age of ignorance
and superstition," and Madison calmly explained that our Constitution declined
to incorporate the common law because many of its principles were anti-republican.<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn125" name="fnb125"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn125" name="fnb125"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn125" name="fnb125"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn125" name="fnb125">[125]</a>
One source of the new rights theory lay in the various "compact" theories
of government, which sought the origins of the state in implicit agreements
rather than in divine commands. The civilian jurist Hotman had initially
argued for such a view in his 1572 work <i>Franco Gallia<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn126" name="fnb126"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn126" name="fnb126"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn126" name="fnb126"></a></i><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn126" name="fnb126">[126]</a>
which became available in English through Molesworth's 1711 translation.<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn127" name="fnb127"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn127" name="fnb127"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn127" name="fnb127"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn127" name="fnb127">[127]</a>
To Hotman, the compact theory represented liberation from autocracy founded
upon "divine right" or supposed tradition: his research sought to trace
government among what became the French people to democratic tribal arrangements,
which in turn were suppressed by usurping monarchs.<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn128" name="fnb128"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn128" name="fnb128"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn128" name="fnb128"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn128" name="fnb128">[128]</a></div>
<div id="h3.2-9">A more abstract (and less democratic) view was taken by
Thomas Hobbes in his 1651 <i>Leviathan</i>.<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn129" name="fnb129"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn129" name="fnb129"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn129" name="fnb129"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn129" name="fnb129">[129]</a>
To him, government was founded upon a compact of mutual protection. The
fundamental rule of nature was "to seek peace and follow it" and, conversely,
<font size="-1">(p.31)</font>"the
second, the sum of the right of nature" was "by all means we can, to defend
ourselves."<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn130" name="fnb130"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn130" name="fnb130"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn130" name="fnb130"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn130" name="fnb130">[130]</a>
This right was so fundamental that it could not be included in the compact:
"A Covenant not to defend my selfe from force, by force, is alwayes vod.
For (as I have shewd before) no man can transfere, or lay down his Right
to save himselfe from Death...."<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn131" name="fnb131"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn131" name="fnb131"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn131" name="fnb131"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn131" name="fnb131">[131]</a>

he in fact admits one circumstance under which the monarch may justly be
replaced by his subjects:</div>
<blockquote>
<div class="j11f0l0r0t1" id="h3.2-10">The Obligation of Subjects to the
Sovereign is understood to last as long, and no longer, than the power
lasteth, by which he is able to protect them. For the right men have by
Nature to protect themselves, when none else can protect them, can by no
Covenant be relinquished.<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn133" name="fnb133"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn133" name="fnb133"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn133" name="fnb133"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn133" name="fnb133">[133]</a></div>
</blockquote>
<div class="j12f2l0r0t1" id="h3.2-11">A different rationalist basis for
colonial derivations of rights encompassed supernatural origins, whether
seen as God or nature. The Anglican church, hamstrung by its acceptance

was unable to make much contribution here, but the slack was more than
taken up by the Congregationalist, Baptist and Presbyterian divines who
played so major a role in promoting the patriot <font size="-1">(p.32)</font>cause.<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn135" name="fnb135"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn135" name="fnb135"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn135" name="fnb135"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn135" name="fnb135">[135]</a>
Joel Barlow, a chaplain in Washington's army, thus derived a right to arms:</div>
<blockquote>
<div class="j11f0l0r0t1" id="h3.2-12">Only admit the original, unalterable
truth, <i>that all men are equal in their rights</i>, and the foundation
of every thing is laid; to build the superstructure requires no effort
but that of natural deduction. The first necessary deduction will be, that
the people will form an equal representative government.... Another deduction
follows, That the people will be universally armed: they will assume those
weapons for security, which the art of war has invented for destruction.<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn136" name="fnb136"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn136" name="fnb136"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn136" name="fnb136"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn136" name="fnb136">[136]</a></div>
</blockquote>
<div class="j12f2l0r0t1" id="h3.2-13">Many colonists also consulted European
natural law theorists in hopes of defining the rights of men.<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn137" name="fnb137"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn137" name="fnb137"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn137" name="fnb137"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn137" name="fnb137">[137]</a>
These thinkers commonly stressed an individual right or duty to self defense
as the very core of individuality. Pufendorf, deriving natural law from
man's instincts toward society, concluded that (at least for a person with
dependents) a failure to use necessary deadly force to defend himself is
a violation of natural law and a sin:</div>
<blockquote>
<div class="j11f0l0r0t1" id="h3.2-14">Nor indeed should it be thought that
the law of nature, instituted as it was for the safety of man, favors such
a peace as would cause his immediate destruction, and bring about anything
but a social life.... Now there are some who would carry this command so
far that it could not be abrogated even by civil law, maintaining that
the man who allows himself to be killed when he could have defended himself,
can be condemned on the same score as if he had killed himself.... To us
it seems necessary to consider first of all, whether it is of any great
concern to others that the person who is attacked survive, or whether,
as a matter of fact, he apparently lives only to himself. We hold that
in the former case the man is <i>obligated</i> to secure his own protection
by every means possible, but, in the latter case we maintain that it is
only <i>permissible</i>....<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn138" name="fnb138"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn138" name="fnb138"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn138" name="fnb138"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn138" name="fnb138">[138]</a><font size="-1">(p.33)</font></div>
</blockquote>
<div class="j12f0l0r0t1" id="h3.2-15">Burlamaqui went farther, maintaining
the natural law of self-preservation might be deduced from reason as well
as social instincts. "Let us suppose man in solitude; he would still have
several duties to discharge, such as to love and honour God, to preserve
himself, to cultivate his faculties...."<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn139" name="fnb139"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn139" name="fnb139"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn139" name="fnb139"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn139" name="fnb139">[139]</a></div>
<div id="h3.2-16">Thus, the intellectual bases for an individual right
to bear arms expanded at the same time that the practical bases for the
militia system declined. Both principles, however, are immortalized in
the second amendment to the Constitution. We might suspect that this is
the remnant of a period in which the decline of the republican militia
ideal overlapped the origin of the Enlightenment and Jeffersonian/Jacksonian
democracy. To test this hypothesis will require a detailed examination
of both the militia and the right to arms concepts during the formation
of the American republic.</div>

<b>IV. The American Right to Arms</b></h2>

<b>A. The Prototypes: Virginia, Pennsylvania and Massachusetts</b></h3>
<div class="j12f2l0r0t1" id="h4.1-1">In the summer of 1776, the Continental
Congress recommended that the former colonies "adopt such governments as
shall, in the opinion of the representatives of the people, best conduce

While not every state responded with a bill of rights (or, for that matter,
a new constitution), a significant number did so as to enable us to trace
the process whereby certain rights became codified in declarations of rights.
Since drafters of each declaration were conversant with the work of their
predecessors and duplicated or differed as they saw fit, it also becomes
possible to compare how different factions phrased particular rights.</div>
<div id="h4.1-2">The ancestry of the second amendment can be found in the
declarations of rights adopted by Virginia, Pennsylvania and Massachusetts.
The different approaches taken by each state give insight into <font size="-1">(p.34)</font>the
differences of opinion over which component, militia or right to arms,
was most deserving of recognition.</div>
<h4 class="l12f0l2r0t1" id="h4.1.1">
1. Virginia and the Well-Regulated Militia</h4>
<div class="j12f2l0r0t1" id="h4.1.1-1">Virginia's Constitution and Bill
of Rights were the first adopted after the Declaration of Independence.
While records of the actual deliberations are limited, it is known that
Thomas Jefferson drafted a document worthy of the Enlightenment. Jefferson's
draft would have extended the franchise to any taxpayer, divided state
lands among the landless citizens, ended importation of slaves, and banned
the establishment of religion. His proposal did not mention the militia
or its role in a republic, but did include a clearly individual right to
arms: "No freeman shall ever be debarred the use of arms."<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn141" name="fnb141"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn141" name="fnb141"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn141" name="fnb141"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn141" name="fnb141">[141]</a></div>
<div id="h4.1.1-2">Virginia's legislature chose instead a constitution
and bill of rights drafted by committee, and taken predominantly from the
proposals of the more conservative George Mason.<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn142" name="fnb142"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn142" name="fnb142"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn142" name="fnb142"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn142" name="fnb142">[142]</a>
The prevailing version omitted any mention of individual arms and substituted
a recognition that: "A well-regulated militia, composed of the body of
the people, trained to arms, is the proper, natural, and safe defence of
a free State."<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn143" name="fnb143"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn143" name="fnb143"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn143" name="fnb143"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn143" name="fnb143">[143]</a></div>
<div id="h4.1.1-3">It is unlikely that the choice was dictated in this
case by a conflict <font size="-1">(p.35)</font>of values. Jefferson, who
had served on the committee to organize the Virginia militia,<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn144" name="fnb144"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn144" name="fnb144"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn144" name="fnb144"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn144" name="fnb144">[144]</a>
was an unlikely opponent of the militia concept. Mason, who was a firearms
collector and George Washington's hunting partner,<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn145" name="fnb145"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn145" name="fnb145"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn145" name="fnb145"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn145" name="fnb145">[145]</a>
was an improbable supporter of individual disarmament. The difference is
more one of emphasis. The Constitution as adopted looks predominantly to
maintenance of the status quo. This was predictable since the members of
the committee charged with the initial drafting were predominantly large
land-owners.<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn146" name="fnb146"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn146" name="fnb146"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn146" name="fnb146"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn146" name="fnb146">[146]</a>
Mason's original draft contained a substantial property requirement for
legislators--only citizens owning 1,000 pounds worth of real estate could
run for the lower house, while only those with twice that freehold could
run for the upper.<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn147" name="fnb147"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn147" name="fnb147"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn147" name="fnb147"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn147" name="fnb147">[147]</a></div>
<p id="h4.1.1-4">In more general terms, the primary concern of the 1776
constitution is (as it was with Harrington and his followers) the establishment
of a stable republic. Indeed, the original draft did not recognize a "right"
to freedom of religion, but rather a "toleration of the exercise of religion,"<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn148" name="fnb148"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn148" name="fnb148"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn148" name="fnb148"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn148" name="fnb148">[148]</a>
along the lines of the British Toleration Act, which for practical grounds
exempted certain faiths from the ban on non-establishment churches.<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn149" name="fnb149"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn149" name="fnb149"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn149" name="fnb149"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn149" name="fnb149">[149]</a>
Only the intervention of the novice legislator James Madison<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn150" name="fnb150"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn150" name="fnb150"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn150" name="fnb150"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn150" name="fnb150">[150]</a>
enabled an American president to later boast: "It is now no more that toleration
is spoken of, as if it was by the indulgence of one class of people, that
another enjoyed the exercise of their inherent natural rights."<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn151" name="fnb151"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn151" name="fnb151"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn151" name="fnb151"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn151" name="fnb151">[151]</a>
The Virginia Declaration <font size="-1">(p.36)</font>thus looks backward
to the classical republic and concern for the state; Jefferson's unsuccessful
draft, in contrast, looked forward to the form of democracy which would
take his name. The gap between the Harringtonian republic and Jeffersonian
democracy was clearly demonstrated in Jefferson's explanation of his draft:
</p><blockquote>
<div class="j11f0l0r0t1" id="h4.1.1-5">I was extending the right of suffrage
(or in other words the rights of a citizen) to all who had a permanent
intention of living in the country. Take what circumstance you please as
evidence of this, either the having resided a certain time, or having a
family, or having property, any or all of them. Whoever intends to live
in a country must wish that country well, and has a natural right of assisting
in the preservation of it.<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn152" name="fnb152"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn152" name="fnb152"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn152" name="fnb152"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn152" name="fnb152">[152]</a></div>
</blockquote>
<div class="j12f0l0r0t1" id="h4.1.1-6">The contrast between Mason's and
Jefferson's proposals highlights a correlation which will be found in later
efforts by other states. Those constitutions which maintained the Classical
Republican link between land ownership and electoral participation also
stressed its ideal of militia institutions. Those constitutions which accepted
the Radical foundation of near-universal manhood suffrage largely ignored
the militia ideal but stressed individual rights to arms.</div>
<h4 class="l12f0l2r0t1" id="h4.1.2">
2. Pennsylvania and the Individual Right to Arms</h4>
<div class="j12f2l0r0t1" id="h4.1.2-1">Pennsylvania adopted a bill of rights
only a few months after Virginia, yet its political situation was nearly
opposite that present in Mason's state. While Virginia's establishment
became the leadership of its revolutionary movement, the Pennsylvania establishment
lagged behind and was overthrown by the Quaker State's revolutionary movement.
The pre-1776 legislature was dominated by the wealthier families; unlike
Virginia's ruling gentry, their wealth was primarily based on shipping
and commerce. The threat to trade posed by the split with Britain understandably
made such men wary of independence.<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn153" name="fnb153"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn153" name="fnb153"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn153" name="fnb153"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn153" name="fnb153">[153]</a>
The revolutionary movement, in contrast, had its primary strongholds in
the more sparsely populated, agrarian West, as well as a secondary base
among the apprentices and "mechanics" (in modern terms, the labor movement)
of Philadelphia.<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn154" name="fnb154"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn154" name="fnb154"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn154" name="fnb154"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn154" name="fnb154">[154]</a><font size="-1">(p.37)</font>As
one writer of the last century, himself sympathetic to the aristocracy,
phrased it:</div>
<blockquote>
<div class="j11f0l0r0t1" id="h4.1.2-2">At the beginning of the contest
with Great Britain the control of affairs in Pennsylvania was still in
the hands of the aristocratic element of the province, which centered in
Philadelphia and the richer and more thickly settled counties adjacent
thereto, and whose power politically was supported by the requirement of
a 50 pound property qualification for the franchise ... [T]he assembly
lent but a lukewarm support to the patriot cause, and many measures earnestly
desired by the patriot leaders failed in that body because of the innate
caution and conservatism of its members.</div>
<div class="j11f2l0r0t0" id="h4.1.2-3">There was, however, another element
well suited by temper and circumstances to play the part desired by the
radical leaders, if only power in proportion to its numbers could be given
it. This was the democracy, the party of the country, as the other was
the party of the city. Its strength lay chiefly in the back counties, where
the independent life of the settler and farmer, and the practical uniformity
of material conditions, naturally stimulated the democratic instinct.<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn155" name="fnb155"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn155" name="fnb155"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn155" name="fnb155"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn155" name="fnb155">[155]</a></div>
</blockquote>
<div class="j12f0l0r0t1" id="h4.1.2-4">The Radical forces launched a successful
assault on the opposition. Following the Continental Congress' call for
new state constitutions, the Committees of Safety arranged extralegal elections
for representatives to a constitutional convention. Each county would elect
an equal number of delegates (thus weighting the convention against the
more populous eastern counties) and the property requirement was waived
for the militia,<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn156" name="fnb156"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn156" name="fnb156"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn156" name="fnb156"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn156" name="fnb156">[156]</a>
who comprised much of those counties' revolutionary element.<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn157" name="fnb157"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn157" name="fnb157"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn157" name="fnb157"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn157" name="fnb157">[157]</a>
In the meantime, Radical members of <font size="-1">(p.38)</font>the assembly
absented themselves; their departure deprived that body of a quorum and
paralyzed any possible counterattack. The aristocratic elements were neatly
trapped; to run for the constitutional convention would be to endorse its
legitimacy without gaining any reasonable chance of winning its control.
Many instead sat out the election, leading to a convention as dominated
by the Radicals as Virginia's had been by the gentry.</div>
<div id="h4.1.2-5">The convention's product has been described as the "most
democratic form of government ever tried by an American State."<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn158" name="fnb158"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn158" name="fnb158"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn158" name="fnb158"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn158" name="fnb158">[158]</a>
The fifty pound franchise requirement was replaced with one that enfranchised
any taxpayer over the age of twenty-one.<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn159" name="fnb159"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn159" name="fnb159"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn159" name="fnb159"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn159" name="fnb159">[159]</a>
It was probably Benjamin Rush, one of the losing aristocrats, who complained
of the power placed in the hands of the citizenry: "They call it a democracy--a
mobocracy in my opinion would be more proper. All our laws breathe the
spirit of town meetings and porter shops."<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn160" name="fnb160"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn160" name="fnb160"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn160" name="fnb160"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn160" name="fnb160">[160]</a></div>
<div id="h4.1.2-6">Pennsylvania became the second state to adopt a bill
of rights; a comparison with Virginia's product is all the more instructive
since the Pennsylvania convention obtained copies of the Virginia Bill
of Rights and were able to use it as a model.<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn161" name="fnb161"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn161" name="fnb161"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn161" name="fnb161"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn161" name="fnb161">[161]</a>
Indeed, John Adams later noted that their "bill of rights is almost verbatim
from that of Virginia."<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn162" name="fnb162"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn162" name="fnb162"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn162" name="fnb162"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn162" name="fnb162">[162]</a>
"Almost" is, however, a word that bears emphasis. Individual rights are
given greater scope in the Pennsylvania declaration than in that of Virginia.<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn163" name="fnb163"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn163" name="fnb163"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn163" name="fnb163"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn163" name="fnb163">[163]</a></div>
<p id="h4.1.2-7">Pennsylvania clearly departed from the Virginia approach
when it deleted the Virginia reference to well regulated militias and added
a new recognition: "That the people have a right to bear arms for the defense
of themselves and the State...."<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn164" name="fnb164"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn164" name="fnb164"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn164" name="fnb164"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn164" name="fnb164">[164]</a>
The "themselves <font size="-1">(p.39)</font>and the State" proviso seems
superfluous, but it reinforces the distinction between the Radicals' recognition
of an individual right (against, it should be noted, even the government
they now dominated) and the Virginia gentry's simple praise of a militia
system as necessary to their "republic." The Radicals of the Pennsylvania
convention thus repudiated Mason's Harringtonian model (which linked land
ownership, political rights, and militia duty) in favor of the Jeffersonian
formula of universal suffrage and an individual right to arms.

</p><p id="h4.1.2-8">The future federal second amendment was thus the direct
descendant, not of any one model, but of two distinct products of two different
political outlooks. The militia component is ultimately derived from the
work of the Virginia convention, which made no effort to define a right
to arms. The second amendment's right to arms component is a direct descendant
of the work of the Pennsylvania Radicals, who sought an unquestionably
individual right and considered a militia statement superfluous.
</p><h4 class="l12f0l2r0t1" id="h4.1.3">
3. North Carolina, Massachusetts and the Unsuccessful Compromise</h4>
<div class="j12f2l0r0t1" id="h4.1.3-1">A third approach deserves mention,
not because it was a progenitor of the second amendment, but because it
was available as a model in 1791 and was specifically rejected by the first
Congress. This approach was taken, only a few months after the Pennsylvania
convention, by North Carolina. That state's convention was split between
Republican and Democratic elements, and its product reflected the need
for compromise.<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn165" name="fnb165"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn165" name="fnb165"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn165" name="fnb165"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn165" name="fnb165">[165]</a>
Under the constitution they voted out, all taxpayers could vote for the
lower house, while those with fifty acres or more of land could vote for
the upper as well. On the other hand, the actual candidates were subject
to stricter requirements; the governor must own 1,000 pounds worth of land,
members of the upper and lower houses 300 and 100 acres, respectively.<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn166" name="fnb166"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn166" name="fnb166"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn166" name="fnb166"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn166" name="fnb166">[166]</a><font size="-1">(p.40)</font>The
franchise was thus quite broad, while the privilege of seeking office was
considerably narrowed. The convention took a similarly eclectic approach
to a bill of rights.</div>
<div id="h4.1.3-2">North Carolina took its Declaration of Rights primarily
from Virginia. However, it replaced Mason's paean to the militia with a
variant of the Pennsylvania approach: "[T]he people have a right to bear
arms, for the defense of the state...."<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn167" name="fnb167"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn167" name="fnb167"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn167" name="fnb167"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn167" name="fnb167">[167]</a>
The omission of the militia statement on the one hand, and the recognition
of an individual right--but only for defense of the State--seems an uneasy
balance between the Virginia and the Pennsylvania models. Massachusetts'
1780 Constitution expanded upon this third approach. Its chief author was
John Adams, probably the colonies' most devout Harringtonian<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn168" name="fnb168"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn168" name="fnb168"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn168" name="fnb168"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn168" name="fnb168">[168]</a>
whose fears that excessive democracy would lead to anarchy<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn169" name="fnb169"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn169" name="fnb169"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn169" name="fnb169"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn169" name="fnb169">[169]</a>
gave force to Jefferson's accusations that Adams was a closet Monarchist.<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn170" name="fnb170"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn170" name="fnb170"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn170" name="fnb170"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn170" name="fnb170">[170]</a></div>
<div id="h4.1.3-3">The Massachusetts Constitution and Bill of Rights drew
heavily upon those of Virginia. Members of the lower house were required
to have freehold estates of 100 pounds, and those of the upper house were
required to own 300 pounds.<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn171" name="fnb171"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn171" name="fnb171"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn171" name="fnb171"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn171" name="fnb171">[171]</a>
The Bill of Rights largely focused upon the nature of the government, occasionally
going so far as to codify its powers rather than restrain them.<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn172" name="fnb172"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn172" name="fnb172"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn172" name="fnb172"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn172" name="fnb172">[172]</a></div>
<p id="h4.1.3-4">Adams chose an unusual mode of coping with the question
of arms and militia provisions. He took the language of the Pennsylvania
convention, expanded it somewhat by recognizing for the first time a right
to "keep" as well as to "bear" arms, but then qualified <font size="-1">(p.41)</font>the
entire provision by recognizing the resulting right only with regard to
the common defense.<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn173" name="fnb173"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn173" name="fnb173"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn173" name="fnb173"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn173" name="fnb173">[173]</a>
Given Adams' outstandingly Harrington viewpoint, the qualifier is hardly
a surprise, although how it can be reconciled with his original proposal
to recognize a right to "keep" arms is unclear. Possibly, to Adams, the
proviso was meant simply as an explanation along the lines of the statements
of social duty mentioned above, and not as an operative qualifier. Perhaps
Adams simply felt a need to reconcile his creation with his philosophy
and thus added a clause tying a radically-conceived right into a Harringtonian
set of political values. The most likely explanation lies, however, in
Adams' legal background and in his general suspicion of the people and
of mobs. To "keep" arms was, after all, a more precise rendition of the
1689 English Declaration than the "to bear" language used in the other
state conventions. The 1670 English Hunting Act, prohibiting arms to the
poor, had used the phrase "have or keep," and the phrase "keep arms" recurs
in post-1692 English case law interpreting the Act as modified after the
Declaration of Rights.<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn174" name="fnb174"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn174" name="fnb174"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn174" name="fnb174"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn174" name="fnb174">[174]</a>
To this extent, Adams' work was what we would expect from one of the premier
attorneys of the colonies. The qualifier "for the common defense" may share
similar roots. If Adams was going to recognize, in precise legal terms,
a right to own or carry firearms as a citizen pleased, he was going to
reserve the power to suppress armed riots. Some seven years later, in his
<i>Defense
of the Constitution</i>, Adams would write:
</p><blockquote>
<div class="j11f0l0r0t1" id="h4.1.3-5">To suppose arms in the hands of
citizens, to be used at individual discretion, except in private self-defense,
or by partial orders of towns, countries or districts of a state, is to
demolish every constitution, and lay the laws prostrate, so that liberty
can be enjoyed by no man; it is a dissolution of the government. The fundamental
law of the militia is, that it be created, directed and commanded by the
laws, and ever for the support of the laws.<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn175" name="fnb175"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn175" name="fnb175"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn175" name="fnb175"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn175" name="fnb175">[175]</a></div>
</blockquote>
<div class="j12f0l0r0t1" id="h4.1.3-6">Adams was thus mindful of the uses
of arms (i.e., legitimate self-defense <font size="-1">(p.42)</font>and militia
duty) and concerned about misuse for mob action or anarchy. With far greater
precision than is typical in constitutional processes, he sought both to
ensure the breadth of the right he desired and to fix its boundaries.</div>
<div id="h4.1.3-7">The popular reaction to his proposal illustrates forcefully
that many ordinary citizens did not share his fears of the people, and
on the contrary feared the exercise of government power that might be allowed
under his "common defense" proviso. A meeting of the citizens of Williamsburg
objected to the language, noting that "we deem it an essential privilege
to keep Arms in our Houses for Our Own Defense" and that the qualifier
might be read to allow government to "Confine all the fire Arms to some
publick Magazine."<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn176" name="fnb176"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn176" name="fnb176"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn176" name="fnb176"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn176" name="fnb176">[176]</a>
In Northampton, an objection was raised that the right to keep and bear
arms "is not expressed with that ample and manly openess and latitude which
the importance of the right merits" and should be changed to "The People
have a right to keep and bear arms, as well, for their Own as the Common
defence ...."<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn177" name="fnb177"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn177" name="fnb177"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn177" name="fnb177"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn177" name="fnb177">[177]</a></div>
<div id="h4.1.3-8">In sum, by 1780 there were three major state models
for dealing with the question of popular armaments: the Virginia or Harrington/Gentry
model, stressing a well-regulated militia; the Pennsylvania or Jeffersonian/Radical
model, stressing an individual right to bear arms; and the Massachusetts
development of the North Carolina model, stressing a right both to keep
and to bear arms, but only for the common defense. It is worth noting that
at the state level, only the Pennsylvania model withstood the test of time.
After 1780, both the Virginia and the Massachusetts models fell into complete
disuse,<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn178" name="fnb178"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn178" name="fnb178"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn178" name="fnb178"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn178" name="fnb178">[178]</a>
while the Pennsylvania model thrived in the age of Jeffersonian <font size="-1">(p.43)</font>democracy.<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn179" name="fnb179"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn179" name="fnb179"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn179" name="fnb179"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn179" name="fnb179">[179]</a></div>
<h3 class="l12f0l2r0t1" id="h4.2">
<b>B. Militia and Individual Armament In the American Bill of Rights</b></h3>
<div class="j12f2l0r0t1" id="h4.2-1">In 1787, the Continental Congress
summoned a convention to propose amendments to the Articles of Confederation.
The decision by the delegates to the Constitutional Convention to instead
draft a replacement compact offered Americans a rare and unique opportunity
to dictate, consciously and in some detail, the terms by which they would
be governed. With the exception of the Article I section 9 limitations
on ex post facto laws, bills of attainder and peacetime suspensions of
habeus corpus, the convention's proposal did little to recognize individual
rights. Conversely, it did expressly grant Congress the power to raise
and support armies, with no restriction save a two-year limit on any appropriations
for that purpose, and also gave the power to provide for the organizing,
arming and disciplining of the militia.<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn180" name="fnb180"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn180" name="fnb180"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn180" name="fnb180"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn180" name="fnb180">[180]</a>
The contrast between the breadth of these powers and the traditional views
of standing armies and militia organization predictably led to conflicts
in the ratifying conventions which were called in each state. It is out
of these conflicts that our Bill of Rights arose.</div>
<h4 class="l12f0l2r0t1" id="h4.2.1">
1. Ratification Conventions Demand a Federal Bill of Rights</h4>
<div class="j12f2l0r0t1" id="h4.2.1-1">The omission of a bill of rights
was a weak point of the proposed Constitution, and soon became the focus
of opposition. The early conflicts critical to the gestation of the Bill
of Rights came in Pennsylvania, Massachusetts and New Hampshire. These
were soon followed by a series of similar demands from Virginia, New York,
and North Carolina. Each of these proposals therefore merits consideration.<font size="-1">(p.44)</font></div>
<h5 id="h4.2.1.1">
a. The Pennsylvania Minority</h5>
<div class="j12f2l0r0t1" id="h4.2.1.1-1">The Pennsylvania convention was
the first to consider major criticism of the absence of a federal bill
of rights. The criticism did not prevail, and the state ratified the Constitution
without reservation. This action seems inconsistent with the same state's
1776 enumeration of rights and stress upon protections of the individual.<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn181" name="fnb181"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn181" name="fnb181"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn181" name="fnb181"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn181" name="fnb181">[181]</a>
The explanation is simple: by 1787, the Philadelphia commercial "empire"
had struck back; the ratifying convention was heavily dominated by the
eastern counties and their commercial aristocracy which, some three years
later, would replace the 1776 Constitution.<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn182" name="fnb182"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn182" name="fnb182"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn182" name="fnb182"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn182" name="fnb182">[182]</a>
In the 1790 state convention, the defending minority would include several
of the men who in 1787 pressed unsuccessfully for a federal bill of rights--Robert
Whitehill, John Smilie and William Findley.<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn183" name="fnb183"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn183" name="fnb183"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn183" name="fnb183"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn183" name="fnb183">[183]</a></div>
<div id="h4.2.1.1-2">In any event, the leaders of the aristocracy who dominated
the 1787 convention had little reason to sympathize with an individual
right to arms. Benjamin Rush's complaint that the 1776 Pennsylvania Constitution
institutionalized "mobocracy" has already been mentioned. James Wilson,
leader of the pro-ratification forces, had recently been on the receiving
end of the "Fort Wilson Incident," in which a firefight broke out between
his supporters, barricaded in his house, and a body of Radical militiamen
marching past in protest over the lack of price controls.<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn184" name="fnb184"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn184" name="fnb184"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn184" name="fnb184"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn184" name="fnb184">[184]</a>
His opponents, as noted previously, were largely supporters of the 1776
Radical-Democratic Constitution.<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn185" name="fnb185"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn185" name="fnb185"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn185" name="fnb185"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn185" name="fnb185">[185]</a></div>
<div id="h4.2.1.1-3">Available records of the Pennsylvania convention<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn186" name="fnb186"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn186" name="fnb186"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn186" name="fnb186"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn186" name="fnb186">[186]</a>
indicate that <font size="-1">(p.45)</font>the lack of a federal bill of
rights was an important issue, and perhaps the most important issue from
the outset.<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn187" name="fnb187"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn187" name="fnb187"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn187" name="fnb187"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn187" name="fnb187">[187]</a>
The dispute came to a head when Whitehill, seconded by Smilie, moved for
a federal bill of rights.<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn188" name="fnb188"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn188" name="fnb188"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn188" name="fnb188"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn188" name="fnb188">[188]</a>
The motion failed, 46-23, and the Federalist majority refused even to permit
it or the vote to be entered in the convention's journal.<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn189" name="fnb189"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn189" name="fnb189"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn189" name="fnb189"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn189" name="fnb189">[189]</a>
Whitehill and Smilie, joined by Findley and other delegates, published
a pamphlet setting out their amendments and rationale; the pamphlet was
in turn reprinted in Pennsylvania newspapers.<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn190" name="fnb190"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn190" name="fnb190"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn190" name="fnb190"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn190" name="fnb190">[190]</a></div>
<p id="h4.2.1.1-4">The minority's argument was hardly Harringtonian. The
limited number of representatives under the new Constitution would, they
argued, present the danger that "men of the most elevated rank will be
chosen. The other orders in society, such as farmers, traders and mechanics
... shall be totally unrepresented."<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn191" name="fnb191"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn191" name="fnb191"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn191" name="fnb191"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn191" name="fnb191">[191]</a>
This was not a criticism that would have moved John Adams, or likely George

the Pennsylvania minority had scarcely a good word for the militia. Indeed,
to them the danger was not that the Congress would fail to adequately discipline
the militia and thereby allow the republican tradition to lapse, but that
Congress might endanger individual liberties by too forcefully using its
powers. Militia discipline to them posed a danger to the individual:<font size="-1">(p.46)</font>
</p><blockquote>
<div class="j11f0l0r0t1" id="h4.2.1.1-6">[T]he personal liberty of every
man, probably from sixteen to sixty years of age, may be destroyed by the
power Congress have in organizing and governing of the militia. As militia
they may be subjected to fines of any amount, levied in a military manner;
they may be subjected to corporal punishments of the most disgraceful and
humiliating nature; and to death itself, by the sentence of a court-martial.<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn195" name="fnb195"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn195" name="fnb195"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn195" name="fnb195"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn195" name="fnb195">[195]</a></div>
</blockquote>
<div class="j12f0l0r0t1" id="h4.2.1.1-7">We are here a long way from the
worries of the later, more conservative Virginia convention; to them, the
predominant danger was that Congress would neglect the militia, or use
it to supplant state governments.<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn196" name="fnb196"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn196" name="fnb196"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn196" name="fnb196"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn196" name="fnb196">[196]</a>
To the Pennsylvanians, these were secondary concerns; the primary danger
was to the individual as such. It is not surprising that, while the Pennsylvania
proposals mirror almost every provision of the later federal bill of rights,<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn197" name="fnb197"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn197" name="fnb197"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn197" name="fnb197"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn197" name="fnb197">[197]</a>
any recognition of the necessity of a militia, or other analog to the militia
component of the second amendment, is pointedly omitted. The militia is
mentioned only in the eleventh proposal, which would simply provide that
its organization, armament and training would remain a state responsibility,
and that no militiamen may be forced to serve outside their state of residence.<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn198" name="fnb198"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn198" name="fnb198"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn198" name="fnb198"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn198" name="fnb198">[198]</a></div>
<div id="h4.2.1.1-8">The Pennsylvania minority did not similarly neglect
the right to arms. Indeed, consistent with their emphasis on individual
rights, their seventh proposal sought recognition:</div>
<blockquote>
<div class="j11f0l0r0t1" id="h4.2.1.1-9">That the people have a right to
bear arms for the defense of themselves and their own State, or of the
United States, or for the purpose of killing game; and no law shall be

</blockquote>
<div class="j12f0l0r0t1" id="h4.2.1.1-10">The Pennsylvania proposals did
not prevail in that state's convention, but the publicity accorded them
ensured that they were considered by members of later conventions.<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn200" name="fnb200"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn200" name="fnb200"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn200" name="fnb200"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn200" name="fnb200">[200]</a>
When, two years later, James Madison sat down to draft the federal bill
of rights, he considered Pennsylvania's minority proposals along with those
of other states.<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn201" name="fnb201"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn201" name="fnb201"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn201" name="fnb201"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn201" name="fnb201">[201]</a></div>
<h5 id="h4.2.1.2">
b. Samuel Adams and the Massachusetts Minority</h5>
<div class="j12f2l0r0t1" id="h4.2.1.2-1">The Massachusetts convention saw
the next proposal for a bill of rights. In that state, however, Federalist
leaders faced an extremely close fight. Anxious for every vote, they accepted
a limited proposal for a bill of rights, which was successfully introduced
by John Hancock.<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn202" name="fnb202"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn202" name="fnb202"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn202" name="fnb202"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn202" name="fnb202">[202]</a>
The rights recognized by Hancock's draft were primarily economic (limiting
direct taxes and federally-created monopolies) or aimed at protecting states'
rights. The only individual rights guaranteed were those to indictment
by grand jury and jury trial in civil cases.<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn203" name="fnb203"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn203" name="fnb203"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn203" name="fnb203"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn203" name="fnb203">[203]</a></div>
<div id="h4.2.1.2-2">Samuel Adams, the famed Radical leader, unsuccessfully
proposed the addition of a paragraph containing a multitude of individual
rights:</div>
<blockquote>
<div class="j11f0l0r0t1" id="h4.2.1.2-3">[T]hat the said Constitution be
never construed to authorize Congress to infringe the just liberty of the
press, or the rights of conscience; or to prevent the people of the United
States, who are peaceable citizens, from keeping their own arms; or to
raise standing armies, except when necessary for the defense of the United
States, or of some one or more of them; or to prevent the people from petitioning,
in a peaceable and orderly manner, the federal legislature for a redress
of grievances; or to subject the people to unreasonable searches and seizures
of their persons, papers or possessions.<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn204" name="fnb204"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn204" name="fnb204"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn204" name="fnb204"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn204" name="fnb204">[204]</a></div>
</blockquote>
<div class="j12f2l0r0t1" id="h4.2.1.2-4">Adams' motion was unsuccessful,<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn205" name="fnb205"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn205" name="fnb205"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn205" name="fnb205"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn205" name="fnb205">[205]</a>
but it is noteworthy that this <font size="-1">(p.48)</font>Radical, whose
constituency was the urban "mechanics" and small tradesmen,<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn206" name="fnb206"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn206" name="fnb206"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn206" name="fnb206"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn206" name="fnb206">[206]</a>
did not consider the militia worthy of mention, while a clearly individual
right to arms merited a detailed guarantee. Even his limitation on standing
armies was no more than a statement of the obvious--that they should not
be maintained where not necessary to defense. Although Sam Adams had a
model in his state constitution, written by his aristocratic cousin John,
he preferred an unlimited individual right to bear arms to John's citation
of arms bearing "for the common defense."<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn207" name="fnb207"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn207" name="fnb207"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn207" name="fnb207"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn207" name="fnb207">[207]</a></div>
<h5 id="h4.2.1.3">
c. New Hampshire: the Bill of Rights Carries a Majority</h5>
<div class="j12f2l0r0t1" id="h4.2.1.3-1">The Pennsylvania minority's position
and that of Sam Adams were ultimately absorbed into the New Hampshire proposals,
attached to that state's crucial ratification.<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn208" name="fnb208"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn208" name="fnb208"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn208" name="fnb208"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn208" name="fnb208">[208]</a>
We know that the vote in New Hampshire was expected to be close--so close
that the Federalists had to obtain a temporary adjournment to muster the
votes needed to avoid defeat.<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn209" name="fnb209"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn209" name="fnb209"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn209" name="fnb209"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn209" name="fnb209">[209]</a>
Unfortunately, we know almost nothing of that state's deliberations.<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn210" name="fnb210"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn210" name="fnb210"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn210" name="fnb210"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn210" name="fnb210">[210]</a>
It is apparent that New Hampshire borrowed "almost verbatim" most of its
proposals from those advanced by Hancock in Massachusetts.<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn211" name="fnb211"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn211" name="fnb211"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn211" name="fnb211"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn211" name="fnb211">[211]</a>
However, the New Hampshire delegates added three proposals of their own,
perhaps taken from Samuel Adams' proposed supplement. The first would have
barred standing armies, or their quartering in private homes during peacetime,
except with consent of three-fourths of the Congress. <font size="-1">(p.49)</font>New
Hampshire's second addition prohibited federal laws affecting religion
or infringing rights of conscience. The third provided that: "Congress
shall never disarm any Citizen except such as are or have been in Actual
Rebellion."<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn212" name="fnb212"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn212" name="fnb212"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn212" name="fnb212"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn212" name="fnb212">[212]</a>
Like the concepts advanced by Sam Adams and by the Pennsylvania minority,
the New Hampshire proposals made no mention of a well-regulated militia.</div>
<div id="h4.2.1.3-2">Thus, at the time of the ninth ratification, three
major proposals for a bill of rights had surfaced.<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn213" name="fnb213"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn213" name="fnb213"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn213" name="fnb213"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn213" name="fnb213">[213]</a>
All sought a clearly individual right to bear arms, and none lauded the
necessity of a militia. The Radical-Republican division visible in the
state bills of rights is apparent here as well; the two demands whose origins
can be traced were advanced by the Radical leadership in each state.</div>
<h5 id="h4.2.1.4">
d. Virginia, New York, North Carolina: the Merger of Republicans and Radicals</h5>
<div class="j12f2l0r0t1" id="h4.2.1.4-1">New Hampshire's ratification did
not end the battle, although by giving the Constitution its ninth ratification,
it bound the states which had already signed the Constitution. Among the
several states which had not ratified were the major commercial states
of Virginia and New York. Few states boasted the intellect arrayed in Virginia,
and in few was ratification as much in doubt.</div>
<div id="h4.2.1.4-2">The Federalists' task was complicated by Virginia's
unusual, perhaps unique, political alignment on the federal constitutional
issues. Leaders in the call for a bill of rights, and in opposition to
the unamended Constitution, came from varied backgrounds. Conservative
George Mason and Democrat Thomas Jefferson joined forces to promote a bill
of rights,<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn214" name="fnb214"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn214" name="fnb214"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn214" name="fnb214"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn214" name="fnb214">[214]</a>
despite their earlier differences as to what such a bill ought to contain.<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn215" name="fnb215"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn215" name="fnb215"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn215" name="fnb215"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn215" name="fnb215">[215]</a>
They were joined by the firebrand Patrick Henry and the more staid Richard
Henry Lee, both of whom defy simple classification.<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn216" name="fnb216"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn216" name="fnb216"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn216" name="fnb216"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn216" name="fnb216">[216]</a><font size="-1">(p.50)</font></div>
<div id="h4.2.1.4-3">Mason's position is perhaps the most simply stated.
To him, the priority was protection of the militia, and the restriction
of a standing army. Yet preserving the militia required a delicate balance:
a government bent upon destroying it might do so either by too lax a regime,
by "neglect[ing] to provide for arming and disciplining the Militia," or
by too strict a one, "subjecting them to unnecessary severity of discipline
in time of peace, confining them under martial law, and disgusting them
so much as to make them cry out, 'give us an army.'"<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn217" name="fnb217"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn217" name="fnb217"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn217" name="fnb217"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn217" name="fnb217">[217]</a>
Patrick Henry shared similar fears. The "militia is our ultimate safety,"<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn218" name="fnb218"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn218" name="fnb218"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn218" name="fnb218"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn218" name="fnb218">[218]</a>
he wrote, yet it might be undermined if either the national government
made no provision for the militia or if its provisions added too much to
the citizens' burdens. To Henry, the militia ideal involved a good deal
of personal freedom to obtain arms. Excessive requirements (e.g., requirement
of a special firearm for federal duty) might hinder rather than aid the
goal. "The great object is that every man be armed," he argued, asking
on the other hand, "but can the people afford to pay for double sets of
arms?"<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn219" name="fnb219"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn219" name="fnb219"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn219" name="fnb219"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn219" name="fnb219">[219]</a>
To Lee, the danger was more one-sided. Congress might well create a select
militia, "distinct bodies of military men, not having permanent interests
and attachments in the community."<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn220" name="fnb220"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn220" name="fnb220"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn220" name="fnb220"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn220" name="fnb220">[220]</a>
Having done this, it would naturally neglect the militia proper, so that
"the yeomanry of the country [who] possess the lands, the weight of property,
possess arms, and are too strong a body of men to be openly offended ...
may in twenty or thirty years be by means imperceptible to them, totally
deprived of that boasted weight and <font size="-1">(p.51)</font>strength."<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn221" name="fnb221"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn221" name="fnb221"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn221" name="fnb221"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn221" name="fnb221">[221]</a></div>
<p id="h4.2.1.4-4">Yet an analysis of only the militia question does an
injustice to all three advocates. Even those who would normally be considered
conservative or Harringtonian placed new emphasis on individual rights.
This may have been a result of their alliance with the Radicals (Jefferson
was no longer a young delegate justifying a radical constitution, but a
former governor charged with the most delicate diplomatic affairs) or due
to the emphasis on individual rights in past conventions, or simply because
the political climate of 1788 was different from that of twelve years before.
To Mason, loss of the militia system was no longer the ultimate risk, but
merely an evil means to a worse end:
</p><blockquote>
<div class="j11f2l0r0t1" id="h4.2.1.4-5">Forty years ago, when the resolution
of enslaving America was formed in Great Britian, the British parliament
was advised by an artful man, who was governor of Pennsylvania, to disarm
the people--that was the best and most effectual way to enslave them--but
that they should not do it openly; but to weaken them and let them sink
gradually, by totally disusing and neglecting the militia.<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn222" name="fnb222"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn222" name="fnb222"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn222" name="fnb222"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn222" name="fnb222">[222]</a></div>
</blockquote>
<div class="j12f2l0r0t1" id="h4.2.1.4-6">Henry shared these feelings. On
the one hand, "the militia, sir, is our ultimate safety," on the other,
"[t]he great object is that every man be armed ... every one who is able
may have a gun."<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn223" name="fnb223"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn223" name="fnb223"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn223" name="fnb223"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn223" name="fnb223">[223]</a>
Richard Henry Lee concluded his republican paean to the militia with a
passage no Jeffersonian Democrat could have bettered. "[T]o preserve liberty,
it is essential that the whole body of the people always possess arms,
and be taught alike, especially when young, how to use them."<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn224" name="fnb224"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn224" name="fnb224"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn224" name="fnb224"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn224" name="fnb224">[224]</a>
Perhaps to Lee "the young and ardent part of the community, possessed of
but little or no property" could not be relied upon as the militia,<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn225" name="fnb225"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn225" name="fnb225"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn225" name="fnb225"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn225" name="fnb225">[225]</a>
but they certainly should have been armed.</div>
<div id="h4.2.1.4-7">Virginia's ratification was secured, albeit by a close
vote of 88-80, and only at the price of simultaneous proposals for a bill
of rights.<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn226" name="fnb226"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn226" name="fnb226"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn226" name="fnb226"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn226" name="fnb226">[226]</a>
The proposals were drafted by a committee that included <font size="-1">(p.52)</font>Antifederalists
Lee and Mason, as well as Federalists James Madison, John Marshall, and
John Wythe.<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn227" name="fnb227"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn227" name="fnb227"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn227" name="fnb227"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn227" name="fnb227">[227]</a>
Madison had always tended to emphasize individual rights in general and
individual armament in particular. At the outset of the Revolution, he
had noted his skill with the rifle;<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn228" name="fnb228"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn228" name="fnb228"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn228" name="fnb228"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn228" name="fnb228">[228]</a>
in Federalist No. 46 he would praise the "advantage of being armed, which
the Americans possess over the people of almost every other nation" and
note that European governments "are afraid to trust their people with arms;"<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn229" name="fnb229"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn229" name="fnb229"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn229" name="fnb229"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn229" name="fnb229">[229]</a>
nearly half a century later, the former President, legislator and "Father
of the Constitution" would attack aristocracy on the ground it could never
be safe "without a standing army, an enslaved press and a disarmed populace."<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn230" name="fnb230"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn230" name="fnb230"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn230" name="fnb230"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn230" name="fnb230">[230]</a></div>
<div id="h4.2.1.4-8">The committee took an unusual approach to the militia
arms concept. Previous proposals had emphasized either the importance of
the militia or recognized an individual right to arms. The Virginia committee
chose to do both, and spliced together wide ranging provisions from earlier
proposals. From Virginia's Bill of Rights came the militia component; while
Mason's presence on the committee made this expected, it is noteworthy
because this was the first time a federal ratifying convention had so stressed
the need for a militia. The right to arms may have been drawn almost verbatim
from the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights, employing its broad reference
to rights to keep as well as to bear arms, while deleting its qualifier
"for the common defense," or it may have been assembled from the Pennsylvania
minority's recognition of a people's right to bear arms, joined to Sam
Adams' proposal of a federal right of "keeping their own arms."<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn231" name="fnb231"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn231" name="fnb231"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn231" name="fnb231"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn231" name="fnb231">[231]</a>
Whatever the origin, it is apparent that Virginia meant to extend broad
protections both to militia needs and individual rights when it called
for recognition "that the people have the right to keep and bear arms;
that a well regulated militia, composed of the body of the people trained
to arms, is the proper, natural and safe defence of a free state ...."<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn232" name="fnb232"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn232" name="fnb232"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn232" name="fnb232"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn232" name="fnb232">[232]</a><font size="-1">(p.53)</font></div>
<p id="h4.2.1.4-9">The Virginia approach of combining a militia recognition
with a statement of individual rights could have been expected to have
a broader appeal than either provision taken alone. It is thus hardly surprising
that it supplanted the previous models, and was employed almost verbatim
in the ratifying conventions in New York and North Carolina.<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn233" name="fnb233"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn233" name="fnb233"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn233" name="fnb233"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn233" name="fnb233">[233]</a>

<b>V. Drafting of the Federal Bill of Rights</b></h2>
<div class="j12f2l0r0t1" id="h5-1">When James Madison found himself cast
in the unlikely role of father of the national bill of rights,<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn234" name="fnb234"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn234" name="fnb234"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn234" name="fnb234"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn234" name="fnb234">[234]</a>
he was not forced to write upon a clean slate. His first step was to obtain
a pamphlet which conveniently listed all state proposals, from the Pennsylvania
minority onward.<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn235" name="fnb235"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn235" name="fnb235"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn235" name="fnb235"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn235" name="fnb235">[235]</a>
The problem became one of editing; out of hundreds of proposals, many redundant
and some questionable, a hard core of usable proposals had to be selected.
The barriers to be surmounted required discarding all controversial proposals.
As he informed Jefferson, "every thing of a controvertible nature that
might endanger the concurrence of two-thirds of each House and three quarters
of the States was studiously avoided."<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn236" name="fnb236"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn236" name="fnb236"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn236" name="fnb236"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn236" name="fnb236">[236]</a>
After excluding the controversial propositions, Madison still had to single
out the most desirable proposal, and then (where several different proposals
had been made to a single end) select the specific terms of the guarantee.
Finally, he had to decide how to assemble and group the rights into a number
of amendments. The last task was to a certain extent governed by Madison's
plan (which had been retained in committee) to <font size="-1">(p.54)</font>interweave
the amendments into the text of the constitution, in the manner of a modern
"pocket part."<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn237" name="fnb237"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn237" name="fnb237"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn237" name="fnb237"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn237" name="fnb237">[237]</a></div>
<div id="h5-2">Madison's decision to include a right to arms in his federal
bill of rights is hardly surprising. Such a right had been demanded in
virtually every call for a bill of rights; indeed, it had received twice
the number of demands accorded freedom of speech.<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn238" name="fnb238"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn238" name="fnb238"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn238" name="fnb238"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn238" name="fnb238">[238]</a>
Language praising the militia had received much less support, essentially
having been appended to the right to arms clause in Virginia and the two
following conventions.<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn239" name="fnb239"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn239" name="fnb239"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn239" name="fnb239"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn239" name="fnb239">[239]</a>
But an adaptation of the Virginia/New York/North Carolina wording combining
the two held unusual promise. One of Madison's major objectives was to
"bring in" North Carolina.<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn240" name="fnb240"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn240" name="fnb240"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn240" name="fnb240"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn240" name="fnb240">[240]</a>
He hoped to convince it to ratify the Constitution by offering an acceptable
bill of rights. North Carolina could hardly object to a nearly verbatim
acceptance of its demand.</div>
<div id="h5-3">A combination of a militia statement with individual right
recognition fitted Madison's objectives perfectly. The militia statement,
standing alone, would likely be unacceptable to groups typified by the
Pennsylvania minority, Sam Adams and his supporters, the New Hampshire
majority, and possibly Jefferson himself, all of whom had advocated an
individual right to arms clause and none of whose efforts had so much as
mentioned the militia. An individual right to arms clause standing alone
might well have irritated militia supporters such as George Mason and possibly
Richard Henry Lee, both powerful Virginians with whom Madison still had
to deal and who would vote on his proposal, Mason in the Virginia legislature
and Lee in the federal Senate.<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn241" name="fnb241"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn241" name="fnb241"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn241" name="fnb241"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn241" name="fnb241">[241]</a></div>
<p id="h5-4">It is doubtful that a militia statement had too much appeal
for Madison himself, although he certainly backed the militia concept and
its necessity to the republic.<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn242" name="fnb242"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn242" name="fnb242"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn242" name="fnb242"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn242" name="fnb242">[242]</a>
Madison was somewhat skeptical <font size="-1">(p.55)</font>of bills of rights
in general--"parchment barriers," he called them, violated at will by majorities
"in every state."<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn243" name="fnb243"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn243" name="fnb243"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn243" name="fnb243"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn243" name="fnb243">[243]</a>
How much more skeptical must he have been of an unenforceable declaration
that a militia when "well" regulated is "necessary" to a free state? Interestingly,
while employing imperative phrasing (i.e., "Congress shall make no law")
in the remainder of the Bill of Rights, Madison did not try his handiwork
on the militia statement. Instead, he let stand George Mason's original,
declaratory form.<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn244" name="fnb244"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn244" name="fnb244"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn244" name="fnb244"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn244" name="fnb244">[244]</a>
</p><p id="h5-5">Further, when Madison outlined the improvements at which the
Bill of Rights were aimed, he cited freedom of press and conscience, the
right to arms, and other liberties; he gave not a word to the militia.<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn245" name="fnb245"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn245" name="fnb245"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn245" name="fnb245"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn245" name="fnb245">[245]</a>
Whatever its value in Madison's eyes, Mason's proclamation that the militia
"is the proper, natural and safe defense of a free state" would stay in,
albeit with modification and abbreviation.<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn246" name="fnb246"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn246" name="fnb246"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn246" name="fnb246"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn246" name="fnb246">[246]</a>
</p><p id="h5-6">Madison's choice for the right to keep and bear arms component
was less complex. Madison knew from experience that the Virginia/New York/North
Carolina model had proven acceptable to all factions in Virginia; indeed,
the committee that drafted it had included himself and Richard Henry Lee,
one of the Constitution's most prominent opponents. It also had been endorsed
by New York and always-vital North Carolina. Moreover, the concise wording
of the statement "the people have a right to keep and bear arms," required
little editing. A Madisonian touch adding a command that it "shall not
be infringed," was all that was needed.

</p><p id="h5-7">The breadth of this language would likely please the Pennsylvania,
Massachusetts, and New Hampshire delegates who had sought <font size="-1">(p.56)</font>an
individual right to arms. With any fortune at all, these delegates would
view Madison's language as incorporating their ideas.<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn247" name="fnb247"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn247" name="fnb247"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn247" name="fnb247"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn247" name="fnb247">[247]</a>
The wording of the militia clause was, after all, a combination of the
broadest terms employed in the state bills of rights. From Pennsylvania
had come the recognition of a popular right to bear arms;<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn248" name="fnb248"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn248" name="fnb248"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn248" name="fnb248"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn248" name="fnb248">[248]</a>
from Massachusetts had come the right to keep them; yet the controversial
Massachusetts limitation to keeping and bearing "for the common defense"<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn249" name="fnb249"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn249" name="fnb249"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn249" name="fnb249"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn249" name="fnb249">[249]</a>
was conspicuously omitted.<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn250" name="fnb250"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn250" name="fnb250"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn250" name="fnb250"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn250" name="fnb250">[250]</a>
Merging the militia declaration with an individual arms clause would thus
have been expected to please George Mason and Samuel Adams alike, nicely
reconciling Harringtonians and Jeffersonians, Conservatives and Radicals.

</p><p id="h5-8">The related issues were dealt with more quickly. Subjection
of the militia to martial law was restricted in what became the fifth amendment
by guaranteeing jury trial to militiamen not in actual service during time
of war or public danger.<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn251" name="fnb251"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn251" name="fnb251"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn251" name="fnb251"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn251" name="fnb251">[251]</a>
Conscientious objection would be taken care of in an addendum to the militia
statement, although that addendum was removed by the Senate.<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn252" name="fnb252"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn252" name="fnb252"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn252" name="fnb252"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn252" name="fnb252">[252]</a>
Thus <font size="-1">(p.57)</font>four arms and military related concerns
raised by the ratifying conventions could be resolved entirely.

</p><p id="h5-9">Significantly, the one military concern not addressed by Madison
was the call for limitations on a standing army. As discussed above, Americans
by 1789 had crossed the line the English Whigs had passed a century before:
a standing army might be a nuisance, but now it was an American nuisance.
Statesmen would still condemn it, but also continue to authorize it. Moreover,
unlike the right to arms and need for a militia, the details of limiting
the army were eminently "controvertible." Federalists in the conventions
had strongly opposed any limitations<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn253" name="fnb253"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn253" name="fnb253"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn253" name="fnb253"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn253" name="fnb253">[253]</a>
and no consensus had developed among the supporters of such limitations.<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn254" name="fnb254"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn254" name="fnb254"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn254" name="fnb254"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn254" name="fnb254">[254]</a>
Madison wisely avoided inserting such limitations in his draft; when others
proposed them in the Senate their motions were uniformly defeated.<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn255" name="fnb255"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn255" name="fnb255"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn255" name="fnb255"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn255" name="fnb255">[255]</a>
The one objective the future second amendment would <i>not</i> seek was
a barrier to a standing army.

</p><p id="h5-10">Having structured his proposals, Madison faced one last choice.
While the Constitution provided for the amendment process, it said nothing
regarding the form of amendments. Madison planned to offer nine amendments,
each containing several paragraphs. Each amendment would be designated
for insertion at a different, specific point in the text of the Constitution.
The first amendment would add a prefix to the Constitution, recognizing
that all power is derived from the people. The second and third (which
were ultimately <font size="-1">(p.58)</font>rejected by the states) would
expand membership of the House and fix their compensation, and would be
added to Article I in sections 2 and 6. The third amendment would have
grouped together ten paragraphs and inserted them in Article I, section
9, immediately following the Constitution's existing guarantees of individual
rights (viz., restrictions on suspension of habeas corpus, bills of attainder
and ex post facto laws).<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn256" name="fnb256"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn256" name="fnb256"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn256" name="fnb256"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn256" name="fnb256">[256]</a>
Interestingly, Madison intended the future second amendment, also containing
individual rights, as a general limitation of legislative power, rather
than as a modification to Congress' militia powers under Article I, section
8. While insertion of militia language might have pleased George Mason,
there is little doubt that the individual right component predominated
in Madison's mind.

</p><p id="h5-11">Madison's handiwork underwent substantial editings in both
House and Senate. The effect was to pare the guarantees to a minimum. Madison's
expansive guarantee of freedom of expression, "the people shall not be
deprived or abridged of their right to speak, to write, or to publish their
sentiments; and the freedom of the press, as one of the great bulwarks
of liberty, shall be inviolable,"<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn257" name="fnb257"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn257" name="fnb257"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn257" name="fnb257"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn257" name="fnb257">[257]</a>
became simply "Congress shall make no law ... abridging the freedom of
speech, or of the press."<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn258" name="fnb258"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn258" name="fnb258"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn258" name="fnb258"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn258" name="fnb258">[258]</a>
Madison's militia and arms provisions fared better. His proposal that "the
right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed; a well
armed and well regulated militia being the best security of a free country..."<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn259" name="fnb259"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn259" name="fnb259"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn259" name="fnb259"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn259" name="fnb259">[259]</a>
became "[a] well regulated militia, composed of the body of the people,
being the best security of a free state, the right of the people to keep
and bear arms, shall not be infringed," as ultimately passed by the House.<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn260" name="fnb260"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn260" name="fnb260"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn260" name="fnb260"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn260" name="fnb260">[260]</a>
Although the first casualties of the House's editorial <font size="-1">(p.59)</font>process
were Madison's preambles and explanations,<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn261" name="fnb261"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn261" name="fnb261"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn261" name="fnb261"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn261" name="fnb261">[261]</a>
the militia statement and the right to arms guarantee were both retained.
The first House apparently did not feel that either portion of the ultimate
second amendment was redundant. The Senate did not either, for it emphasized
the differing natures of each provision. On the one hand, it refused to
add "for the common defense" to the right to arms guarantee,<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn262" name="fnb262"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn262" name="fnb262"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn262" name="fnb262"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn262" name="fnb262">[262]</a>
which would have suggested that the guarantee's purpose was linked solely
to the militia; on the other, it replaced the House's statement that the
militia was "the best security" of a free state with a stronger statement
that it was "necessary" to that security.<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn263" name="fnb263"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn263" name="fnb263"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn263" name="fnb263"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn263" name="fnb263">[263]</a>
</p><h2 id="h6">
<b>VI. Conclusion</b></h2>
<div class="j12f2l0r0t1" id="h6-1">The second amendment to the Constitution
had two objectives. The first purpose was to recognize in general terms
the importance of a militia to a free state. This recognition derives from
the very core of Classical Republican thought; its "constituency" among
the Framers was found primarily among conservatives, particularly Virginia's
landed gentry. Indeed, prior to Virginia's proposal, no federal ratifying
convention had called for such recognition. The second purpose was to guarantee
an individual right to own and carry arms. This right stemmed both from
the English Declaration of Rights and from Enlightenment sources. Its primary
supporters came from the Radical-Democratic movement, whether based among
the small farmers of western Pennsylvania or the urban mechanics of Massachusetts.
Only by incorporating both provisions <font size="-1">(p.60)</font>could
the first Congress reconcile the priorities of Sam Adams with those of
George Mason, and lessen the "disquietude" both of the Pennsylvania and
Massachusetts minorities and those of the Virginia and New York majorities.
The dual purpose of the second amendment was recognized by all early constitutional
commentators;<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn264" name="fnb264"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn264" name="fnb264"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn264" name="fnb264"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn264" name="fnb264">[264]</a>
the assumption that the second amendment had but a single objective is
in fact an innovation born of historical ignorance.</div>
<div id="h6-2">The distinction between the second amendment's purposes
enables us to avoid the pitfalls of the collective rights view, which would
hold that the entire amendment was meant solely to protect a "collective
right" to have a militia.<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn265" name="fnb265"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn265" name="fnb265"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn265" name="fnb265"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn265" name="fnb265">[265]</a>
The militia component of the second amendment was not meant as a "right",
collective or individual, except in the sense that structural provisions
(e.g., requirements that money bills originate in the House, or military
appropriations not exceed two years) are considered collective "rights."
Indeed, the militia component was meant to invoke the exertion of governmental
power over the citizen, to inspire it to require citizens to assume the
burdens of militia duty. In this respect it differs radically from any
other provision of the Bill of Rights. To read what was a recognition of
an individual right, the right to arms, as subsumed within the militia
recognition is thus not only permitting the tail to wag the dog, but to
annihilate what was intended as a right.<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn266" name="fnb266"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn266" name="fnb266"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn266" name="fnb266"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn266" name="fnb266">[266]</a>
As the one <font size="-1">(p.61)</font>provision of the Bill of Rights which
encourages rather than restricts governmental action, the militia component's
terms were necessarily vague and its phrasing a reminder rather than a
command.<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn267" name="fnb267"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn267" name="fnb267"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn267" name="fnb267"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn267" name="fnb267">[267]</a></div>
<div id="h6-3">The right to arms portion of the second amendment, in contrast,
was meant to be a prohibition, as fully binding as those in the remainder
of the Bill of Rights. Madison intended that the second amendment be read
as incorporating the individual rights proposals put forward by the Pennsylvania
minority and by Sam Adams and the New Hampshire convention. Judging from
contemporary discussion in Massachusetts and Pennsylvania, he succeeded.<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn268" name="fnb268"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn268" name="fnb268"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn268" name="fnb268"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn268" name="fnb268">[268]</a>
If either clause can be accorded primacy, it is the right to arms clause;
only in Virginia, at the eleventh hour of the ratification process, was
a militia clause appended to a federal bill of rights proposal.</div>
<p id="h6-4">Reading the entirety of the second amendment as militia-related,
based upon some contemporary references to the need for constitutional
<font size="-1">(p.62)</font>recognition
of the militia concept, confuses the purpose of one provision with the
text of another. The second amendment, in short, cannot be explained simply
as a last avowal of the classical ideal, as "the last act of the Renaissance."<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn269" name="fnb269"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn269" name="fnb269"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn269" name="fnb269"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn269" name="fnb269">[269]</a>
Rather, it is a bridge between the decline of that ideal and the rise of
the liberal democracy. Part of the second amendment looks backward to the
worlds of Polybius and Machiavelli; but part looks forward, to the worlds
of Jefferson and Jackson. Only a recognition of the dual nature of the
second amendment will enable us to give meaning to the aspirations of Thomas
Jefferson and Samuel Adams as well as those of George Mason.<a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn270" name="fnb270"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn270" name="fnb270"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn270" name="fnb270"></a><a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#fn270" name="fnb270">[270]</a>

The second amendment's capitalization and punctuation is not uniformly
reported; another version has four commas, after "militia," "state," and

punctuation and capitalization are common, and the copy retained by the
first Congress, the copies transmitted by it to the state legislatures,
and the ratifications returned by them show wide variations in such details.

This approach fell into disfavor in the early twentieth century, but its
resurgence in recent years has altered constitutional interpretation. While
advocates of collective rights approaches have for a decade failed to produce
much in the way of original thought or research, the last five years have
seen an explosion of original research supporting the individual rights
approach. See, e.g., <i>Caplan, The Right of the Individual to Bear Arms:

The author has suggested a third school of thought, advocating a "hybrid"
right, in which the right is individual but its source is collective. In
this view, individuals are seen as having a right to possess arms suitable
for organized military reserve duty. See <i>Hardy, Armed Citizens supra
note <a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#n3-1">3</a>, at <a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/historiography.html/hardcit.html#pg615">615-622</a></i>.

Madison's original proposal took no fewer than 46 words to describe the
rights involved: "The right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not
be infringed; a well-armed, and well-regulated militia being the best security
of a free country: but no person religiously scrupulous of bearing arms,
shall be compelled to render military service in person." <i>12 The Papers
of James Madison 201 (R. Rutland &amp; C. Hobson eds. 1979)</i>. The version
finally voted out by the Congress uses only 24 words. Madison's original
version also illustrates his approach of grouping several rights into a
single amendment, since it incorporated not only a militia and a right
to arms component, but would have added a constitutional right to conscientious
objection.

Shalhope cites, as typical, a 1940 conclusion that "Americans in 1776 had
little if any knowledge of past republics and that consideration of these
was clearly irrelevant to the discussion of the origins of republican institutions
in America." <i>Shalhope, Toward a Republican Synthesis: The Emergence

Many may think these concepts are recent creations. In fact, Sir John Fortescue,
who fought in the War of the Roses, distinguished in the 1470s between
France's "jus regale" and England's "jus regale et polliticum." "Jus Regale"
can be rendered "royal law" or "law of the king"; "polliticum" can be rendered
as "of the State," "national," or even "of the republic" (Latin translation
of Plato's Republic rendered the title as "Politia"). Fortescue argued
that the French peasants were starved and impoverished so that they were
"crokyd" and "feble," and unable to defend the realm: "nor thai have wepen,
nor money to bie them wepen withall." Thus the French king, unable to use
his unreliable nobility or his weak and unarmed peasants, was forced to
rely on mercenaries: "Lo, this is the frute of his Jus regale. Yf the reaume
of Englonde, wich is an Ile, and therfor mey not lyghtly geyte soucore
of other landes, were rulid vnder such a lawe and vnder such a prince,
it wolde be a pray to all oper nacions pat wolde conqwer, robbe or deuouir
it." Fortunately, Englishmen were healthy, wealthy and armed to the teeth,
"wherfore thai ben myghty, and able to resiste the adversaries of this
realme, and to beete oper reaumes that do, or woldee do them wronge. Lo,
this is the fruty of Jus polliticum et regale, under wich we live." <i>J.

The Mutiny Acts authorized the imposition of martial law on persons enlisted
in the military. Absent their sanctions, a deserting soldier could be punished
by a civil suit for breach of contract, or at most, prosecution as a runaway
apprentice; one who struck an officer might face misdemeanor assault charges
in the civilian courts. <i>C. Barnett, Britain's Army 1503-1970, at 124
(1970)</i>. The post-1688 Mutiny Acts were generally of one year's duration,
ensuring that without annual parliamentary reauthorization army discipline
would be almost unattainable.

To be sure, the events of 1688 cannot be represented as an unqualified
Whig victory. William's policies favored neither party, and those of his
successor Ann strongly favored Tories. Only with the accession of George
I in 1714 did the Whigs attain a dominant hand. See generally <i>B. Williams,
The Whig Supremacy 1714-1760 (2nd ed. 1962)</i>. At the same time, for
Whigs after 1688 the destruction of the government would likely mean replacement
of a generally unsympathetic Tory establishment with an oppressive and
vengeful Jacobite one, and the loss of their gains made during the Glorious
Revolution.

Even under William, who relied heavily upon Whig ministers, "[t]he honeymoon

Act briefly lapsed in 1679, the royal courts asserted a common law basis
for the prohibition against most political publications, the Chief Justice
stating that it extended to "all Persons that do Write or Print or Sell
any Pamphlet that is either Scandalous to Public or Private Persons." <i>G.

instructions in the Seven Bishop's Case are instructive. "In the first

of the government, unless he have leave from the government. If he does,
he makes a libel, be what he says true or false; if we once come to impeach
the Government by way of argument, it is argument that makes government
or no government.... My next position is, that no private man can take
upon him to write concerning the government at all, for what has any private
man to do with the government. It is the business of the Government to
manage matters relating to the government; it is the business of subjects
to manage only their private affairs.... when I intrude myself into matters

From 1686 to 1732, the standard royal command authorizing colonial governors
to assume their post ordered them to ban not only printing, but also possession
of a printing press, without a license. "You are to provide by all necessary

or other matters whatsoever be printed without your especial leave and

In 1762, the author of a legal treatise was threatened with prosecution

whom had sat in Parliament. <i>5 Lord Campbell, Lives of the Lord Chancellors

a military force, it was used for domestic law enforcement. However, the

If "revolution" seems a strange term to apply to the actions of a predominantly
conservative, thoroughly "establishment" Englishman, it must be remembered
that the term was invented to describe this particular event and (being
taken from the mechanical arts) was meant to describe a return to the constitutional
point of origin. James, the term implied, had reversed constitutional norms:
the "revolutionaries" sought to restore them through further action. See

Following their acceptance, they summoned a proper Parliament which, being
thus empowered to enact legislation, enacted the Declaration of Rights
as a bill of rights. <i>1 W.&amp; M., ch. 1, § 2 (1688)</i>. See generally

The concentration upon fundamentals, and matters of consensus, had a practical
basis. Until the Declaration could be drafted, the throne could not be
offered to William and Mary. James might at any point return, either through
negotiation or through invasion. William began to hint that, absent a prompt
offer, he was prepared to return to the Continent. Accordingly, a statement
of the most vital rights had to be quickly prepared and had to be limited
to such as all factions would agree upon. <i>G. Trevelyan, supra note <a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#n58-1">58</a>,

Guarantees of rights to petition, prohibitions on excessive bail or fines
and protections against cruel and unusual punishments are obvious examples
of safeguards embodied in the Bill of Rights. Other guarantees of the Declaration
were written into our Constitution itself. Bans on levying of taxes without
legislative consent, guarantees that "parliaments ought to be held frequently,"
and that freedom of debate in Parliament "ought not to be impeached or
questioned in any court or place out of parliament" all reflect concepts
written into our 1787 Constitution.

Boscawen also added a personal element to Temple's complaints of disarmament:
"Acts of the Long Parliament--Corporation Act--That the same with the resolution--The
most loyal or deserving, turned out.--Militia--Imprisoning without reason;
disarming--Himself disarmed." Id. The reference to the Long Parliament
is ambiguous; that would normally identify the Parliament which sat from
1640-1649, during the Civil War, and was dissolved by Cromwell. By adding
in the various "rump" Parliaments under the Protectorate, it can be extended
to 1660. Might Boscawen have been referring to Charles II's first Parliament,
the "Cavalier" or "Pensioner" Parliament? Since it met intermittently from
1661 to 1679, it certainly was a long Parliament, if not the "Long Parliament,"
and it enacted the Corporation Act (which turned non-royalists out of all
city governments) as well as the Militia Act, both of which Boscawen names
as grievances.

Maynard would later successfully argue that Parliament ought to proceed
both to fill the throne and secure their rights. <i>Id. at 417</i>. Sergeant
was then, incidentally, a very high legal rank; in court, a Sergeant-at-law
was entitled to speak first, before even the Attorney or Solicitor General,
and was entitled to be addressed as "brother" by the bench; while all others
uncovered their heads in the Royal presence, the Sergeant retained his
coif, lest it be thought that the law must humble itself before a monarch.

As Dr. Malcolm notes, "The provision in the Declaration of Rights that
Protestant subjects had a right to have arms suitable to their conditions
and as allowed by law was interpreted to mean that all Protestants, whatever
their condition, were permitted to have arms." <i>Malcolm, supra note <a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#n3-1">3</a>
at 16</i>. The extension of rights such as these to all Protestants was
a legacy of the Protestant dissenters' contribution to the Glorious Revolution.
Previously, non-Anglican Protestants had been viewed as a public danger;
the Presbyterians and Independents had, after all, been the mainstay of
Cromwell's Protectorate and were often lumped in with Catholics as persons
who believed monarchs might be overthrown for religious reasons. One seventeenth
century sermon indeed charged that Jesuits and Calvinists were "sworn brothers
in iniquity, to plot and conspire the death and ruine of Princes." <i>G.
Sensenbaugh, supra note <a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#n54-1">54</a>, at 75</i>. It would be
interesting to have the reactions of Jean Calvin and Ignatius Loyola to
that accusation.

Maryland's colonial militia code of 1692 paralleled the 1662 Militia Act,
but added a proviso that "no pressmaster or any persons whatsoever shall

In 1774, the British government banned export of arms and ammunition to
the colonies, and instructed General Gage to disarm rebellious areas. After
several attempts to raid militia arsenals in the Boston area, some successful
and some unsuccessful, an intended raid on the Concord arsenal brought
about the outbreak of war at Lexington and Concord. At almost the same
time, British authorities in Virginia secretly emptied the powder magazine
at Williamsburg, but were discovered as they made off. The Virginians responded
by mustering militia units, confronting British officials, and seizing
200 muskets from the governor's mansion. The unusually bad timing of the
two raids thus brought Massachusetts and Virginia (which otherwise had
little in common) into an alliance in revolution, thus uniting the leadership
of New England and the South. See generally <i>Hardy, Armed Citizens, supra

the 1798 quasi-war with France, this was expanded to four regiments. <i>W.

susceptible"); <i>id. at 360</i> (Jefferson, 1804: "Should any improvement
occur in the militia system, that will be always seasonable"). After all
these efforts, Congress still failed to attempt any significant improvements.
By 1805, even Jefferson was reduced to asking for a select militia, which
had been anathema even to conservatives a few years before: "I can not,
then, but earnestly recommend to your early consideration the expediency
of so modifying our militia system as, be a separation of the more active
part from that which is less so, we may draw from it when necessary an
efficient corps fit for real and active service, and to be called to it
in regular rotation." <i>Id. at 373</i>.

As a modern British writer put it:
</p><blockquote>
<div class="j9f0l0r0t0" id="n111-2">It follows from all this that there
is nothing rigid or static about the English Constitution. Not being set
out or declared in any sacrosanct document nor hedged in by some special
procedure of amendment, it can be changed or modified in any or every particular
by the ordinary process of legislation. It can be reformed in any part
by an ordinary Act of Parliament assented to in the ordinary way.</div>
</blockquote>
<div class="j9f0l0r0t0" id="n111-3"><i>S. B. Chrimes, English Constitutional
History 9 (2d ed. 1953)</i>. Madison's attack on the Alien and Sedition
Acts still stands as an impeccable sketch of the difference between the
English and American understandings:</div>
<blockquote>
<div class="j9f0l0r0t0" id="n111-4">In the British Government the danger
of encroachment on the rights of the people is understood to be confined
to the executive magistrate. The representatives of the people in the Legislature
are not only exempt themselves from distrust, but are considered as sufficient
guardians of the rights of their constituents against the danger from the
Executive. Hence it is a principle, that the Parliament is unlimited in
its power; or, in their own language, is omnipotent. Hence too, all the
ramparts for protecting the rights of the people--such as the Magna Carta,
their Bill of Rights, [etc.]--are not reared against the Parliament, but
against the royal prerogative .... In the United States, the case is altogether
different. The People, not the Government, possess the absolute sovereignty.
The Legislature, no less than the Executive, is under limitations of power.</div>

Hobbes' appeal to power and consent as the basis of dominion upset the
royalists, while his assertion that popular consent once given could never
be modified or revoked (absent failure of the sovereign to perform the
sole duty of protection) alienated their opposition. Hobbes was concerned,
after the Restoration, that Royalists might have him burned for heresy;
as it was, they settled for burning his books at Oxford. <i>C. Hill, supra
note <a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#n34-1">34</a>, at 249</i>. During our own colonial period,
he was "denounced as frequently by loyalists as by patriots." <i>B. Bailyn,

This view is not completely fair: Hobbes in fact admits that his sovereign
can be a democratic government: "The legislator in all Common-wealths,
is only the Soveraign, be he one Man, as in a Monarchy, or one Assembly
of men, as in a Democracy, or Aristocracy." <i>Id., ch. 26 at 226</i>.
Hobbes also seems to accept that a government might be one of limited powers,
although he clearly regards this as a mistake: "Amongst the Infirmities
therefore of a Common-wealth ... this is one, That a man to obtain a Kingdome
is sometimes content with lesse power, than to the Peace, and defence of
the Common-wealth is necessarily required. From whence it commeth to passe
that when the exercise of the Power layd by, is for the publique safety
to be resumed, it hath the resemblance of an unjust act...." <i>Id., ch.

The doctrine of nonresistance (which was derived from the Pauline epistles
and early Christian martyrology) maintained that Christians were required
to submit to a ruler, no matter how unjust; indeed, the reliance upon the
submission of early Christians to martyrdom indicated that submission was
required even to a pagan ruler bent upon extirpating Christianity. See
generally <i>G. Senssbaugh, That Grand Whig Milton (1952)</i>. The seriousness
with which this was taken can be seen in the aftermath of the Seven Bishops'
Case, in which James II prosecuted seven Anglican bishops for seditious
libel. After James was overthrown in the Glorious Revolution, a majority
of the seven were forced to resign by the new government because they were
"nonjurors," unable in conscience to take an oath recognizing William and
Mary as sovereigns. Whatever his actions toward them, their nation or their
church, James was still their monarch, to whom submission was due. <i>C.

Jefferson had probably had troubles with trespass and poaching. Washington,

to his neighbors in vain efforts to stop such poaching. See <i>37 Writings

also would have divided State lands among persons owning no lands, or less
than fifty acres apiece, would have provided that they would be held in

permitted in Virginia), and would have barred transfer of State lands "until

Traditionally, the Bill of Rights is ascribed to Mason. This attribution
is based in large part on Edmund Randolph's recollection that Mason's proposals
"swallowed up all the rest." <i>1 B. Schwartz, The Bill of Rights: A Documentary
History 247 (1971)</i>. Recent evidence suggests, however, that the relevant
portion was added by the committee, albeit taken almost verbatim from Mason's
Fairfax Resolves. See <i>H. Miller, George Mason: Gentleman Revolutionary
148 (1975)</i>. On the other hand, there also is evidence that the Fairfax
Resolves were more of a committee effort than has previously been supposed.
See <i>Sweig, A New-Found Washington Letter of 1774 and the Fairfax Resolves,
40 Wm. &amp; Mary Q. (3d. Ser.) 283 (1983)</i>. It is clear in any event
that the body of the Virginia Constitution was in fact a committee effort,

This is consistent with the hypothesis that Mason differed from Jefferson
and the Radicals not so much in values as in perspective. To Mason, the
object was to establish a stable republic, which would naturally respect
individual rights, while to Jefferson the object was to reserve the rights
and let the republic form within those reservations.

One historian noted in a recent work:
</p><blockquote>
<div class="j9f0l0r0t0" id="n157-2">Aristocratic Whigs described the militia
privates as "in general damn'd riff raff--dirty, mutinous and disaffected."
The militia described themselves as "composed of tradesmen and others,
who earn their living by their industry ..." [A] check of one militia company
roster against the published tax lists for Philadelphia reveals that of
sixty-seven names, almost half (twenty-nine) appeared on no tax list between
1769 and 1781 .... For such men, participation in the militia was the first
step in the transition from crowd activity to organized politics. Like
the New Model Army of the English Civil War, the militia was a "school
of political democracy."</div>

Virginia's approach prevailed only in Maryland, whose 1776 constitution
recognizes that "a well-regulated militia is the proper and natural defence
of a free government." <i>Maryland Declaration of Rights § 25 (1776),
reprinted in 3 F. Thorpe, supra note <a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#n143-1">143</a>, at 1688</i>.
Maryland's 1776 Constitution also imposed varying property requirements
for voting and candidacy, ranging from 50 acres of land to vote for the
lower house, to 1000 acres for a state senator or any representative to
the Continental Congress. Id. at 1691, 1695, 1696. "The property requirements
contained in the Maryland constitution excluded almost 90 per cent of Maryland's
male taxpaying population from holding provincial office. Because of these
restrictions, only ten percent could qualify for the lower house and seven
percent for the upper. The elite's dominance of the constitution accurately
reflected the class structure of the society." <i>Hoffman, The "Disaffected"
in the Revolutionary South, reprinted in The American Revolution: Explorations
in the History of American Radicalism 280 (A. Young ed. 1976)</i>. Today,
the Massachusetts "common defense" model is followed in only 4 states of

See generally <i>Alexander, The Fort William Incident of 1779: A Case Study
of the Revolutionary Crowd, 31 Wm. &amp; Mary Q. (3d Ser.) 589 (1974)</i>.
The militia citizen group was marching in support of price controls, which
they argued were necessitated by merchant speculation. In anticipation
of the march, Wilson's home (nicknamed due to the sturdiness of its construction,
"Fort Wilson") was occupied by thirty or so of his supporters. During the
march, a firefight broke out between the occupants of the house and the
militia; one occupant and several militiamen were killed. Although this
may seem a comparatively tame affair by our standards, it was seen at the
time as quite stunning; contemporaries wrote of "a convulsion among the
people" and "[m]any flying the city for fear of [v]engeance." <i>Id. at
589</i>.

The following discussions are based heavily upon <i>J. McMaster and F.
Stone, supra note <a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#n101-1">101</a></i>. For most ratifying conventions,
the standard reference is <i>The Debates in the Several State Conventions
on the Adoption of the Federal Constitution (reprint 1966) (J. Elliot 2d
ed. 1836)</i>. This work reports but little of the Pennsylvania convention,
since Elliot relied upon reports published by a reporter apparently bribed
by the Federalists to publish only the speeches of the two leaders of their
group. <i>J. McMaster &amp; F. Stone, supra note <a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#n101-1">101</a>,

is stated to have moved the articles "which might either be taken collectively,
as a bill of rights, or separately, as amendments to the general form of
government proposed." <i>Id. at 421</i>. Presumably, he sought ratification
of an amended version of the proposed Constitution, which might well have
raised problems in itself.

The later fifth and eighth amendments are taken almost verbatim from the

of freedom of conscience, speech, press, and the establishment of protection
against warrants unsupported by evidence or not particularly describing

inhabitants of the several States shall have liberty to fowl and hunt in
seasonable time on the lands they hold, and on all other lands in the United
States not inclosed, and in like manner to fish in all navigible waters
...." Id. This provision was adapted from a similar guarantee in the 1776
State constitution, which was defended at the time as barring British-style
Hunting Acts which could be used to disarm the populace. See <i>Hardy,

The Journal of the convention shows Adams' motion as losing on a voice
vote. <i>Id. at 87</i>. The record of the debates indicates he withdrew
his motion. <i>Id. at 266</i>. The former version is not only more authoritative,
but more logical; the motion came at the very end of the convention, when
Adams had nothing to lose by pushing the matter to a vote. Moreover, the
report of the debates bore a caveat: "The printers who took the minutes
of the preceding Debates, are conscious that there are some inaccuracies,
and many omissions made in them. It could not be otherwise, as they were
inexperienced in the business, and had not a very eligible situation to
hear in the Convention." Id. at "Note to the First Edition of the Debates"

A modern historian classifies Henry as "firmly attached to the world of
the gentry." <i>Isaac, Preachers and Patriots: Popular Culture and the
Revolution in Virginia, reprinted in The American Revolution 128, 153 (A.
Young ed. 1976)</i>. Jefferson, who knew him, would have differed. "Whenever
the courts were closed for the winter session, he would make up a party
of poor hunters of his neighborhood, would go off with them in the piny
woods of Fluvanna, and pass weeks in hunting deer ... wearing the same
shirt the whole time, and covering all the dirt of his dress with a hunting
shirt." <i>M. Tyler, Patrick Henry 29-30 (reprint 1980) (1898)</i>. Richard
Henry Lee's background would mark him as a member of the innermost circles
of planter aristocracy. Yet this can hardly explain his objection to the
proposed constitution that "the lower and middle classes of people would
have no great share [in taxation decisions]", nor his contemplated move
to New England: "The hasty, unpersevering, aristocratic genius of the south
suits not my disposition, and is inconsistent with my ideas of what must
constitute social happiness." See <i>Letters from the Federal Farmer, supra
note <a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#n101-1">101</a>, at 20</i>; <i>E. Morgan, The Challenge

See <i>id. at 912, 968</i>. Yet of the two, only New York ratified. North
Carolina is best described as declining to ratify, since that state's convention

Madison had argued against a bill of rights in his contributions to the
Federalist Papers. See <i>The Federalist, supra note <a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#n229-1">229</a>,
at 238</i>. At the Virginia convention, he argued that "A bill of rights
would be a poor protection for liberty." <i>1 B. Schwartz, supra note <a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#n142-1">142</a>,
at 764</i>. Even after introducing his bill of rights, he informed Jefferson
"My own opinion has always been in favor of a bill of rights.... At the
same time I have never thought the omission of a material defect, nor been
anxious to supply it even by subsequent amendment, for any other reason
than that it is anxiously desired by others." <i>11 Papers of James Madison
297 (R. Rutland &amp; C. Hobson eds. 1977)</i>. Yet this and later tendencies
to downplay the bill of rights as an improvement on the Constitution may
have been an attempt to avoid accusations of inconsistency. No one could
complain if Madison, who had expressed his personal beliefs that a bill
of rights was unnecessary, was later to advocate one simply because his
constituents demanded it.

Madison was also walking a fine line between the Federalist and Antifederalist
camps. He strove to propose amendments which would appease the Antifederalists,
thus heading off some of their likely proposals which might impair Federalist
aims. The tactic was suggested to him by Henry Lee, Richard Henry Lee's
brother.

"When Madison became President he did everything in his power to carry

Indeed, deciding upon the structure of the federal militia had been one
of the most divisive questions of the young republic. It would have been
hard for Madison to have made the militia statement specific and enforceable
and at the same time avoid controversy. See generally <i>supra notes <a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#n93-1">93-101</a></i>.

The outline was used for Madison's June 8 speech in the House; in outlining
the reasons why the English Declaration of Rights cannot be relied upon
as an adequate statement of individual rights, it notes "arms to Protts,"
an apparent reference to the Declaration's statement that "the subjects
which are protestant" may have arms.

The difficulties in wording the militia statement as a command also highlight
its unique status: it is the only portion of the bill of rights which essentially
calls for government action, rather than prohibiting it.

This in fact happened. For example, a Massachusetts newspaper described
Madison's draft as incorporating Adams' proposals, including that for a
right to arms. The Massachusetts articles were reprinted in the <i>Philadelphia
Independent Gazeteer, Aug. 20, 1789, at 2, col. 2</i>. See generally <i>Hardy,
Origins and Development of the Second Amendment, supra note <a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#n3-1">3</a>,
at 250</i>; <i>Halbrook, Right to Bear Arms, supra note <a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#n3-1">3</a>,
at <a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/historiography.html/halvt.html#pg309">309-10</a></i>. A Pennsylvania newspaper
explained that in Madison's draft "the people are confirmed by the next
article in the right to keep and bear their private arms." <i>The Federal
Gazette &amp; Philadelphia Evening Post, June 18, 1789, at 2, col. 1</i>.
The article was written by Tenche Coxe, a friend of Madison. Coxe mailed
a copy to Madison on the day of publication; Madison took time from the
debates to reply with appreciation and note that it had already appeared
"in the Gazettes here." <i>Hardy, Armed Citizens, supra note <a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#n3-1">3</a>,

The absence was not inadvertent; the Senate rejected, by voice vote, a
proposal to add "for the common defense" to the right to arms clause. <i>Journal
of the First Session of the Senate of the United States of America 77 (Washington
1820)</i> ("On motion to amend article the fifth, by inserting these words,
'for the common defense,' next to the words 'bear arms': It passed in the
negative.").

Madison's original proposals would have included the following: "The trial
of all crimes (except in cases of impeachments, and cases arising in the
land or naval forces, or the militia when on actual service, in time of
war or public danger) shall be by an impartial jury of freeholders of the
vicinage, with the requisite unanimity ... and in all crimes punishable
with loss of life or member, presentment or indictment by a grand jury
shall be an essential preliminary...." <i>1 Journal of Congress 452 (J.
Gales ed. 1789)</i>. This proposal was ultimately divided into the fifth
and sixth amendments, the first of which applies his armed forces and active
militia exception to the requirement of indictment by grand jury.

(James Wilson, in the Pennsylvania convention: "It may be frequently necessary
to keep up standing armies in time of peace. The present Congress have
... [gone] farther and raise[d] an army without communicating to the public
the purpose .... When the commotions existed in Massachusetts, they gave
orders for enlisting an additional body of two thousand men .... [O]ught

Virginia's Bill of Rights, for instance, merely provided that standing
armies in time of peace "should be avoided." Maryland's provided that standing
armies (presumably in war as in peace) ought not to be kept up "without
the consent of the legislature." Massachusetts provided that standing armies
in time of peace ought not to be kept up without the consent of the legislature.
See <i>3 F. Thorpe, supra note <a href="http://www.hardylaw.net/#n143-1">143</a>, at 3814, 1688,

in peacetime, while Sam Adams desired to bar them only when not "necessary."

A proposal to add to what became the second amendment a recognition that
such armies are "dangerous to liberty," should be avoided as far as possible,
and would be authorized in peace only upon a two-thirds vote of each house
of Congress was lost six to nine. Four days later, an amendment stating
more concisely that a two-thirds majority was necessary was lost on a voice
vote. <i>Journal of First Session of the Senate of the United States 71,

were dealt with as follows: a provision forbidding state interference with
rights of conscience or press, or to jury trial, would be inserted in article
I, § 10, following the existing restrictions on state powers; a right
to civil jury trial and limitation on federal appeal would be inserted
in article III, § 2, following the existing definition of federal
judicial power; a detailed guarantee of criminal jury trial and grand jury
indictment would be substituted for the existing jury guarantees in that

Lost, for example, were Madison's proposed preamble to the Constitution,
stating that "Government is instituted and ought to be exercised for the
good of the people; which consists in the enjoyment of life and liberty
..."; his explanation that freedom of the press is "one of the great bulwarks
of liberty"; and the explanation that the express guarantees ought not
be read to rule out other rights retained by the people, since they were
inserted "either as actual limitations of such powers, or as inserted merely
for greater caution." <i>1 Annals of Congress 451 (J. Gales ed. 1789)</i>.
The House was apparently more interested in stating concisely the limitations
upon federal power than in explaining why the limitations were created.
