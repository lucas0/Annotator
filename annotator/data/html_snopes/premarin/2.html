<td width="550"><font face="arial" size="+2">Hormone Replacement Therapy</font>
<p><i>So this is menopause. You are 52 years old and have not had a
          period in a year. That’s good. You are still having some hot
          flashes, but generally they are not too bad. You wake up early too
          often, and that makes you tired during the day. What worries you is
          this – your mother is 77. She just fell and broke her hip. Her
          doctor says she has osteoporosis. What can you do to keep that from
          happening to you in the future?</i>
</p><p>Doctors sometimes prescribe the hormones estrogen and progestin, in
          a treatment called hormone replacement therapy (HRT), to ease the
          signs of menopause. It may also protect you against more serious
          illness in the future. Many women take HRT. Some women should not. It
          may or may not be the right choice for you.
          </p><p>First, it’s a good idea to know what happens to your body with
          menopause. At this time, your body makes less of the female hormones,
          estrogen and progesterone. After menopause, you are free from concerns
          about monthly menstrual periods and getting pregnant. But during the
          years around menopause you might have annoying symptoms. These may
          include hot flashes (a sudden flush or warmth, often followed by
          sweating), sleep problems, or vaginal dryness. Many women have little
          or no trouble with menopause. Some have moderate to severe
          discomfort. 
          </p><p>Estrogen loss also puts you at risk for more serious health
          problems. These include heart disease, stroke, and osteoporosis. Heart
          disease is the leading cause of death for women over the age of 50. It
          kills more women than lung and breast cancer combined. 
          </p><p>Bone loss is common as people age. However, if there is a great
          loss, osteoporosis may develop. This is a serious condition. Bones
          weaken and break easily. It threatens about 28 million Americans.
          Eighty percent of them are women, and most are over 50 years of
          age. 
          </p><p><b>What Is HRT?</b>
</p><p>Doctors usually prescribe HRT which combines estrogen and progestin
          (a form of progesterone). Estrogen can and should be used alone
          (estrogen replacement therapy or ERT) for women who have had their
          uterus, including the cervix, removed (by hysterectomy). 
          </p><p>Estrogen alone comes in many forms. You can use the pill or tablet
          form, vaginal creams, vaginal ring insert, implants, or shots. There
          are also patches that stick to the skin. The body absorbs estrogen
          from the patch through the skin. Progestin usually is taken in pill
          form, sometimes in the same pill as the estrogen. It is also available
          as an IUD (intrauterine device), a vaginal gel, and shots. 
          </p><p>The form your doctor suggests may depend on your symptoms. For
          instance, estrogen creams are used for vaginal dryness. The vaginal
          ring insert treats vaginal dryness and may help urinary tract
          symptoms, such as problems holding urine. Pills or patches, however,
          are used to provide additional relief from menopause symptoms such as
          hot flashes or to prevent bone loss.
          </p><p>There are different schedules for taking HRT in pill form. You
          could take estrogen every day for a set number of days, add progestin
          for 10-14 days, and then stop taking one or both for a specific period
          of time. You would repeat the same pattern every month. This <i>cyclic
          </i>schedule often causes regular monthly bleeding like a light
          menstrual period. Or you could take estrogen and progestin together
          every day of the month without any break. This <i>continuous </i>pattern
          can stop monthly bleeding after about six months of treatment.
          However, problem spotting may continue for longer. Talk with your
          doctor about the schedule that is best for you.
          </p><p><b>Why Should I Think About HRT/ERT?</b>
</p><p>Taking HRT/ERT for a short time (perhaps for a few years) may help
          relieve the annoying symptoms, such as hot flashes, that you may be
          having during menopause. Taking such hormone supplements for a longer
          time: 
          </p><ul>
<li>will also help delay osteoporosis, </li>
<li>may protect against heart disease, </li>
<li>should improve your cholesterol levels, and </li>
<li>may also help your memory.</li>
</ul>
<b>What Are The Risks of HRT/ERT?</b>
<p>Both HRT and ERT can have side effects. You could have bloating,
          breast tenderness, cramping, irritability, depression, and sometimes
          spotting or a return of monthly periods for a few months or years. By
          changing the amount of hormone, the way it is taken, or the timing of
          the dose, your doctor may be able to control these side effects. They
          may disappear over time also. 
          </p><p>Many women now live 25, 30, or more years after menopause. Could
          taking hormone therapy for many of those years be helpful to women?
          Would it be safe? Women and their doctors need to know the benefits
          and risks of using HRT or ERT for many years. Studies are now being
          done to provide the answers. Some of the known or suspected risks are:
          </p><blockquote>
<i><br/>
            Endometrial cancer. </i>Estrogen supplements, particularly in high
            doses, can lead to endometrial cancer, a cancer of the lining of the
            uterus. Most doctors now suggest lower doses of estrogen, along with
            a form of progesterone, for women who still have a uterus. The
            progesterone protects against this form of cancer<font size="-1">.</font>
            Women who have had their uterus and cervix removed can use estrogen
            alone. 
            <p><i>Breast Cancer. </i>An important question about HRT and ERT is
            presently under study: <i>Does HRT/ERT increase your risk of breast
            cancer? </i>Although the answer is not known now, many doctors
            believe that if you are not at high risk for breast cancer, you can
            safely use HRT or ERT. They believe that the benefits of this
            therapy to the heart and bones are more important than the risks in
            many women. This is especially true for women with a family history
            of osteoporosis.
            </p><p><i>Blood clots. </i>Another possible risk of HRT, ERT, and the
            osteoporosis drug raloxifene for some women is blood clots in their
            veins. The chance of developing these clots is small for women not
            using these hormones or drugs. There is a significant increase in
            your chance of blood clots if you take any of these.
          </p></blockquote>

<p><b>What are SERMs?</b>
</p><p>SERMs (selective estrogen receptor modulators) are a new type of
          medicine. Raloxifene (approved by the Food and Drug Administration to
          prevent osteoporosis) and tamoxifen (approved for breast cancer
          treatment and prevention) are examples of SERMs. They are designed to
          do some of the good things estrogen does such as protecting bone
          density. However, they may not have some of the negative side effects.
          For example, tamoxifen appears to protect against developing breast
          cancer. Raloxifene does not seem to increase the chance of endometrial
          cancer as estrogen alone or tamoxifen might. Women on tamoxifen should
          see their gynecologist regularly to be sure their uterus is normal.
          These two SERMS do, however, have a risk of blood clots similar to
          estrogen. Also, raloxifene and tamoxifen can make hot flashes worse.
          Scientists are continuing to work on developing better SERMs to use
          for menopause in the future. 
          </p><p><b>Should I Use Hormone Therapy?</b>
</p><p>This question is best answered after talking with your doctor
          (general practitioner, internist, or gynecologist). He or she can tell
          you if you should consider HRT or ERT. You probably should not use
          these supplements if you have liver disease, high levels of
          triglycerides (a type of fat in the blood), or a history of blood
          clots in your veins. Women with a family history of breast cancer
          might also want to get the opinion of their cancer doctor.
          </p><p>The first step is to decide how much you are bothered by menopause
          symptoms such as hot flashes. You will also need to think about your
          medical history, your risk of heart disease, osteoporosis, and breast
          cancer, and your family history of these illnesses.
          </p><p>Any decision about HRT or ERT that you make now is not final. You
          can start or end the treatment anytime, but if you stop it, the
          protective effects of these therapies will stop as well. Your decision
          about hormone therapy should be reviewed each year with your doctor at
          your annual checkup. After menopause, it is important to continue
          yearly breast and vaginal exams, Pap tests, and mammograms, as well as
          a general physical exam.
