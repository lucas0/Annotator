https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/marcus-dixon/	marcus dixon, an africanamerican teenager, was sentenced to ten years in prison for having had sex with a white teenaged girl.	there is an 18 year old african american honor student — marcus dixon — in rome, georgia who is spending ten years in prison for having consensual sex with a white classmate who was just three months shy of 16 yrs old at the time they had sex. although a jury acquitted marcus of rape and three other counts of violent acts, the prosecutor also charged him with “aggravated child molestation.” consensual sex with a virgin fits into the technical reading of this georgia statute. the statute has never been applied to consensual sex between two teenagers with less than three years age difference, until now. i believe the result is a horrible injustice, especially because marcus overcame a troubled childhood to excel in academics and athletics. what follows are the general details. in february 2003, marcus dixon, was a senior in high school. marcus is not your typical senior. he had a 3.96 grade point average, a 1200 on his sats, and was all state in football. he was offered scholarships to every major school in the south but chose vanderbilt university because he felt they were the best academically. in essence, this alone, made marcus a star. think about it, how many all-state football players carry a 3.96 grade point average? how many high school kids at all have a 3.96 and a 1200 on their sats? statistically speaking, not many. this alone set marcus apart from the other seniors in his class. but there is more. marcus was born in rome, georgia a rural town about 70 miles outside of atlanta that still carries much of the prejudices and complications of the deep south. marcus’ biological mother is a drug addicted career criminal who has been in and out of prison since marcus was a baby. his biological father never had anything to do with him. most kids born into this situation have little or no chance of succeeding. yet marcus defied the odds. when marcus was ten years old, a local white family became his legal guardians. why is this relevant? in a town where many still believe that blacks and whites should not mix, this family took marcus in and raised him as their own. again, most children born into marcus’ situation barely survive. marcus is the exception. beyond all the odds and probabilities he is a star. so what happened? how did this star come crashing down? it started in february 2003. marcus had sex with a girl just shy of sixteen. she was a virgin. she is also white. two days later, she accused marcus of rape. some speculate she made the accusation because she was afraid of her admittedly racist father. regardless of the reasons, a jury of nine white jurors and three african americans took only 15-20 minutes to determine, after hearing all the evidence, that marcus did nothing wrong. the jury decided that the incident was no more than two teenagers having consensual sex. based on the girl’s own testimony, it is amazing they ever brought charges against marcus. and yet, in the rural town of rome, georgia, where there is still some kkk rumblings, 9 white and 3 african american jurors found her story to have absolutely no basis in fact. so why is marcus in prison? how is it possible that a high school boy who had consensual sex with a classmate is in prison for ten years? marcus was indicted under six different statutes under georgia law. four of the statutes include use of force. he was acquitted on all charges that included force. the jury was very specific. it was not even close. it is not that they had reasonable doubt…they had no doubt – the sex was consensual. the girl was not there against her will. the prosecutor, in what can only be perceived as an act of complete disregard for the law, facts and justice in general, included a charge of “aggravated child molestation”. under georgia law, if anyone (age of the perpetrator is irrelevant – he could be 15) has sex with a minor (under 16) that results in an “any injury”, he is guilty of “child molestation”. the jury deliberated for hours on this charge. in the end, technically, this situation fell under the purview of the statute as written. marcus, admittedly had sex with the girl, she was under 16 (by three months), and, again admittedly, she was a virgin. it was the fact that she was a virgin that resulted in the guilty verdict. you see, she sustained an “injury” as a result of intercourse. technically, he is guilty. the absurdity of charging a high school boy with child molestation for consensual sex with a high school girl is beyond description. in essence, every girl in georgia that loses her virginity before 16 can charge the boy with aggravated child molestation. by definition, he is guilty, even if he is younger than the girl. taken to further extremes, if a teenager gives another teen a hickey (technically an “injury”), he or she is guilty of aggravated child molestation the way this statute was drafted. clearly, this was not the legislative intent. in fact, no high school boy or girl has ever been charged with child molestation of a classmate less than three years his or her junior, until marcus. never. in the history of georgia, marcus is the only one in prison for consensual sex with a girl less than three years younger. while the jury found him guilty, they had no idea of the consequences. they assumed marcus would be released immediately. in the jurors own words, the look of horror across their faces when the judge sentenced marcus to ten years minimum could be seen by everyone. they never knew the consequences. they could not fathom that a boy could go to jail for consensual sex, and certainly not for 10 years with no possibility of parole. and yet he has. why the prosecutor charged him under a statute that was clearly designed to apply to adult sexual predators of minors is beyond understanding. how the judge could allow the charge to stand is unconscionable. what their motives or rationalizations, one can only speculate. this is the kind of injustice that we americans like to think is reserved for third world countries.

https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/swift-justice/	swift boat veterans offer opinions about john kerry.	swift boat quotes about john kerry “during the vietnam war i was task force commander at an thoi, and my tour of duty was 13 months, from the end of tet to the beginning of the vietnamization of the navy units. “now when i went there right after tet, i was restricted in my movements. i couldn’t go much of anyplace because the vietcong controlled most of the area. when i left, i could go anywhere i wanted, just about. commerce was booming, the buses were running, trucks were going, the waterways were filled with sampans with goods going to market, but yet in kerry’s biography he says that our operations were a complete failure. he also mentions a formal conference with me, to try to get more air cover and so on. that conference never happened…” — captain adrian lonsdale, uscg (retired) “while in cam rahn bay, he trained on several 24-hour indoctrination missions, and one special skimmer operation with my most senior and trusted lieutenant. the briefing from some members of that crew the morning after revealed that they had not received any enemy fire, and yet lt.(jg) kerry informed me of a wound — he showed me a scratch on his arm and a piece of shrapnel in his hand that appeared to be from one of our own m-79s. it was later reported to me that lt.(jg) kerry had fired an m-79, and it had exploded off the adjacent shoreline. i do not recall being advised of any medical treatment, and probably said something like ‘forget it.’ he later received a purple heart for that scratch, and i have no information as to how or whom. lt.(jg) kerry was allowed to return to the good old usa after 4 months and a few days in-country, and then he proceeded to betray his former shipmates, calling them criminals who were committing atrocities. today we are here to tell you that just the opposite is true. our rules of engagement were quite strict, and the officers and men of swift often did not even return fire when they were under fire if there was a possibility that innocent people — fishermen, in a lot of cases — might be hurt or injured. the rules and the good intentions of the men increased the possibility that we might take friendly casualties.” — commander grant hibbard, usn (retired) “i served with these guys. i went on missions with them, and these men served honorably. up and down the chain of command there was no acquiescence to atrocities. it was not condoned, it did not happen, and it was not reported to me verbally or in writing by any of these men including lt.(jg) kerry. in 1971, ’72, for almost 18 months, he stood before the television audiences and claimed that the 500,000 men and women in vietnam, and in combat, were all villains — there were no heroes. in 2004, one hero from the vietnam war has appeared, running for president of the united states and commander-in-chief. it just galls one to think about it.” — captain george elliott, usn (retired) “my name is steve gardner. i served in 1966 and 1967 on my first tour of duty in vietnam on swift boats, and i did my second tour in ’68 and ’69, involved with john kerry in the last 2 1/2 months of my tour. the john kerry that i know is not the john kerry that everybody else is portraying. i served alongside him and behind him, five feet away from him in a gun tub, and watched as he made indecisive moves with our boat, put our boats in jeopardy, put our crews in jeopardy… if a man like that can’t handle that 6-man crew boat, how can you expect him to be our commander-in-chief?” — steven gardner “i do not believe john kerry is fit to be commander-in-chief of the armed forces of the united states. this is not a political issue. it is a matter of his judgment, truthfulness, reliability, loyalty and trust — all absolute tenets of command. his biography, ‘tour of duty,’ by douglas brinkley, is replete with gross exaggerations, distortions of fact, contradictions and slanderous lies. his contempt for the military and authority is evident by even a most casual review of this biography. he arrived in-country with a strong anti-vietnam war bias and a self-serving determination to build a foundation for his political future. he was aggressive, but vain and prone to impulsive judgment, often with disregard for specific tactical assignments. he was a ‘loose cannon.’ in an abbreviated tour of four months and 12 days, and with his specious medals secure, lt.(jg) kerry bugged out and began his infamous betrayal of all united states forces in the vietnam war. that included our soldiers, our marines, our sailors, our coast guardsmen, our airmen, and our pows. his leadership within the so-called vietnam veterans against the war and testimony before congress in 1971 charging us with unspeakable atrocities remain an undocumented but nevertheless meticulous stain on the men and women who honorably stayed the course. senator kerry is not fit for command.” — rear admiral roy hoffman, usn (retired), chairman, swift boat veterans for truth “we resent very deeply the false war crimes charges he made coming back from vietnam in 1971 and repeated in the book “tour of duty.” we think those cast an aspersion on all those living and dead, from our unit and other units in vietnam. we think that he knew he was lying when he made the charges, and we think that they’re unsupportable. we intend to bring the truth about that to the american people. we believe, based on our experience with him, that he is totally unfit to be the commander-in-chief.” — john o’neill, spokesman, swift boat veterans for truth “during lt.(jg) kerry’s tour, he was under my command for two or three specific operations, before his rapid exit. trust, loyalty and judgment are the key, operative words. his turncoat performance in 1971 in his grubby shirt and his medal-tossing escapade, coupled with his slanderous lines in the recent book portraying us that served, including all pows and mias, as murderous war criminals, i believe, will have a lasting effect on all military veterans and their families. kerry would be described as devious, self-absorbing, manipulative, disdain for authority, disruptive, but the most common phrase that you’d hear is ‘requires constant supervision.'” — captain charles plumly, usn (retired) “thirty-five years ago, many of us fell silent when we came back to the stain of sewage that mr. kerry had thrown on us, and all of our colleagues who served over there. i don’t intend to be silent today or ever again. our young men and women who are serving deserve no less.” — andrew horne “in my specific, personal experience in both coastal and river patrols over a 12-month period, i never once saw or heard anything remotely resembling the atrocities described by senator kerry. if i had, it would have been my obligation to report them in writing to a higher authority, and i would certainly have done that. if senator kerry actually witnessed or participated in these atrocities or, as he described them, ‘war crimes,’ he was obligated to report them. that he did not until later when it suited his political purposes strikes me as opportunism of the worst kind. that he would malign my service and that of his fellow sailors with no regard for the truth makes him totally unqualified to serve as commander-in-chief.” — jeffrey wainscott “i signed that letter because i, too felt a deep sense of betrayal that someone who took the same oath of loyalty as i did as an officer in the united states navy would abandon his group here (points to group photo) to join this group here (points to vvaw protest photo), and come home and attempt to rally the american public against the effort that this group was so valiantly pursuing. it is a fact that in the entire vietnam war we did not lose one major battle. we lost the war at home… and at home, john kerry was the field general.” — robert elder “my daughters and my wife have read portions of the book ‘tour of duty.’ they wanted to know if i took part in the atrocities described. i do not believe the things that are described happened. let me give you an example. in brinkley’s book, on pages 170 to 171, about something called the ‘bo de massacre’ on november 24th of 1968… in kerry’s description of the engagement, first he claimed there were 17 servicemen that were wounded. three of us were wounded. i was the first…” — joseph ponder “lt. kerry returned home from the war to make some outrageous statements and allegations… of numerous criminal acts in violation of the law of war were cited by kerry, disparaging those who had fought with honor in that conflict. had war crimes been committed by us forces in vietnam? yes, but such acts were few and far between. yet lt. kerry have numerous speeches and testimony before congress inappropriately leading his audiences to believe that what was only an anomaly in the conduct of america’s fighting men was an epidemic. furthermore, he suggested that they were being encouraged to violated the law of war by those within the chain of command. very specific orders, on file at the vietnam archives at texas tech university, were issued by my father [admiral elmo zumwalt] and others in his chain of command instructing subordinates to act responsibly in preserving the life and property of vietnamese civilians.” — lt. col. james zumwalt, usmc (retired) “we look at vietnam… after all these years it is still languishing in isolated poverty and helplessness and tyranny. this is john kerry’s legacy. i deeply resent john kerry’s using his swift boat experience, and his betrayal of those who fought there as a stepping-stone to his political ambitions.” — barnard wolff “in a whole year that i spent patrolling, i didn’t see anything like a war crime, an atrocity, anything like that. time and again i saw american fighting men put themselves in graver danger trying to avoid… collateral damage. when john kerry returned to the country, he was sworn in front of congress. and then he told my family — my parents, my sister, my brother, my neighbors — he told everyone i knew and everyone i’d ever know that i and my comrades had committed unspeakable atrocities.” — david wallace “i was in an thoi from june of ’68 to june of ’69, covering the whole period that john kerry was there. i operated in every river, in every canal, and every off-shore patrol area in the 4th corps area, from cambodia all the way around to the bo de river. i never saw, even heard of all of these so-called atrocities and things that we were supposed to have done. this is not true. we’re not standing for it. we want to set the record straight.” — william shumadine “in 1971, when john kerry spoke out to america, labeling all vietnam veterans as thugs and murderers, i was shocked and almost brought to my knees, because even though i had served at the same time and same unit, i had never witnessed or participated in any of the events that the senator had accused us of. i strongly believe that the statements made by the senator were not only false and inaccurate, but extremely harmful to the united states’ efforts in southeast asia and the rest of the world. tragically, some veterans, scorned by the antiwar movement and their allies, retreated to a life of despair and suicide. two of my crewmates were among them. for that there is no forgiveness. ” — richard o’meara “i served in vietnam as a boat officer from june of 1968 to july of 1969. my service was three months in coastal division 13 out of cat lo, and nine months with coastal division 11 based in an thoi. john kerry was in an thoi the same time i was. i’m here today to express the anger i have harbored for over 33 years, about being accused with my fellow shipmates of war atrocities. all i can say is when i leave here today, i’m going down to the wall to tell my two crew members it’s not true, and that they and the other 49 swiftees who are on the wall were then and are still now the best.” — robert brant “i never saw, heard of, or participated in any swift boat crews killing cattle, poisoning crops, or raping and killing civilians as charged by john kerry, both in his book and in public statements. since we both operated at the same time, in the same general area, and on the same missions under the same commanders, it is hard to believe his claims of atrocities and poor planning of sea lord missions. i signed this letter because i feel that he used swift boat sailors to proclaim his antiwar statements after the war, and now he uses the same swift boat sailors to support his claims of being a war hero. he cannot have it both ways, and we are here to ask for full disclosure of the proof of his claims.” — james steffes	['john kerry']		David Mikkelson	['http://www.richmond.edu/~ebolt/history398/JohnKerryTestimony.html']
https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/front-porch/	for john kerrys labor day front porch stop in canonsburg, pennsylvania, neighborhood streets were closed and residents told to take down their bushcheney signs.	good tuesday morning! john kerry brought his “front porch meeting” to our canonsburg, pa neighborhood on labor day morning. since you will never hear the truth from the tv or print media i thought that you should know from someone who was ‘almost’ there. the residents who live on the street where the event took place were not allowed to attend. kerry shipped in approximately 90 invitation only vips. in addition, there was a hard luck case who was about to lose her job at usair and another was an elderly woman who was having health care problems. neither one was from this neighborhood. the street was closed to all traffic the night before and all residents on the street were required to remove their bush/cheney signs. the sympathetic police officers on duty told us that kerry used imminent domain to claim the street for his purposes. residents who have homes within the perimeter (approximately 1 full block) were kept behind a line away from the partisan crowd. the rest of us were not allowed within the 1 block cordon. a neighbor from across the street came to the line where we were being kept and asked us to come onto his property. the police told us that we could stand on this mans formerly private property! this was set up so that kerry’s views could be heard – but not the neighbors. about 30 peoples (mostly neighbors) shouts echoed down the street “let the neighbors in”. we could barely hear kerry speaking with his microphone because press buses were used to block us off from view! this mornings papers are reporting how hecklers tried to interrupt kerry as he spoke to the neighborhood gathering, but he turned our chants to his favor by calling us rude. even though most of the media was there to record our stories of not being included in the neighborhood forum, not one of them printed or aired the truth. this is what america will look like if kerry becomes president. get registered and get all of your friends registered to vote if they have not already. kerry thinks that he is better than the rest of us and he has the media on his side to make him out to be what he is not! finally, last night as i drove down the street where the rally was, i was shocked to see bush/cheney signs in almost every yard on the street! please send this e-mail on to as many people as you can. let freedom ring!

https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/the-balming-of-london/	email lists reactions to the london subway bombings purportedly collected from londoners.	when the news reporter said “shopkeepers are opening their doors bringing out blankets and cups of tea” i just smiled. it’s like yes. that’s britain for you. tea solves everything. you’re a bit cold? tea. your boyfriend has just left you? tea. you’ve just been told you’ve got cancer? tea. coordinated terrorist attack on the transport network bringing the city to a grinding halt? tea dammit! and if it’s really serious, they may bring out the coffee. the americans have their alert raised to red, we break out the coffee. that’s for situations more serious than this of course. like another england penalty shoot-out. to quote an old londoner who lived through the blitz and got caught up in the canary wharf explosion: “i’ve been blown up by a better class of bastard than this!” we took on the romans, the saxons, the danes, the french, william wallace, the black plague, the roundheads, the great fire, napoleon, the nazis, and the blitz, and we’re still here. you terrorists are bloody amateurs. from the bbc website: statement from al qaeda: “britain is now burning with fear, terror and panic in its northern, southern, eastern, and western quarters”. erm really… where? i think you will find that’s a reaction to the winning the olympics bid or perhaps just the effect bush has on us when he visits?! i will admit, the first thought that flashed through my head were images of angry french nationalists in very silly berets and overlong cigarette holders, muttering angrily about losing the olympics, sneaking through the tube planting bombs…	[]		David Mikkelson	['http://www.dorktower.com/']
https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/grave-matter/	casey sheehans grave is unmarked with a standard headstone.	this will never make the ny times!!!!! thought this might just interest some of y’all.. i think it’s noteworthy! obviously, it’s a picture in a cemetery. what cemetery and whose grave? yes, it’s sadly the grave of casey sheehan. after two years, and a dod payment of $250,000 life insurance to the “peace mom”, she has not had the time or bothered to have a headstone placed on this young hero’s grave. and, she doesn’t even have to pay for one, the dod will provide one: “the department of veterans affairs (va) furnishes upon request, at no charge to the applicant, a government headstone or marker for the grave of any deceased eligible veteran in any cemetery around the world. for all deaths occurring before september 11, 2001, the va may provide a headstone or marker only for graves that are not marked with a private headstone. flat markers in granite, marble, and bronze and upright headstones in granite and marble are available. the style chosen must be consistent with existing monuments at the place of burial. niche markers are also available to mark columbaria used for internment of cremated remains.” she can find time to protest on at least 3 continents, get arrested various times, go on vacation in hawaii, have photo ops with the marxists in venezuela but can’t seem to find the time to properly mark her son’s grave. oh yea — cindy sheehan recently treated herself to a brand new volkswagen beetle convertible. she still can’t be bothered to buy a grave marker for her son though.

.. saddam is gone. .. iraq is free. .. president bush has not faltered or failed. .. yet, little or none of this information has been published by the press corps that prides itself on bring you all the news that’s important. iraq under us lead control has come further in six months than germany did in seven years or japan did in nine years following wwii. military deaths from fanatic nazi’s, and japanese numbered in the thousands and continued for over three years after wwii victory was declared. it took the us over four months to clear away the twin tower debris, let alone attempt to build something else in its place. now, take into account that almost every democrat leader in the house and senate has fought president bush on every aspect of his handling of this country’s war and the post-war reconstruction; and that they continue to claim on a daily basis on national tv that this conflict has been a failure. taking everything into consideration, even the unfortunate loss of our sons and daughters in this conflict, do you think anyone else in the world could have accomplished as much as the united states and the bush administration in so short a period of time? [collected on the internet, 2005] did you know this? did you know that 47 countries have re-established their embassies in iraq? did you know that the iraqi government employs 1.2 million iraqi people? did you know that 3100 schools have been renovated, 364 schools are under rehabilitation, 263 schools are now under construction and 38 new schools have been built in iraq? did you know that iraq’s higher educational structure consists of 20 universities, 46 institutes or colleges and 4 research centers? did you know that 25 iraq students departed for the united states in january 2004 for the re-established fulbright program? did you know that the iraqi navy is operational? they have five 100-foot patrol craft, 34 smaller vessels and a navel infantry regiment. did you know that iraq’s air force consists of three operation squadrons, 9 reconnaissance and 3 us c-130 transport aircraft which operate day and night, and will soon add 16 uh-1 helicopters and 4 bell jet rangers? did you know that iraq has a counter-terrorist unit and a commando battalion? did you know that the iraqi police service has over 55,000 fully trained and equipped police officers? did you know that there are 5 police academies in iraq that produce over 3500 new officers each 8 weeks? did you know there are more than 1100 building projects going on in iraq? they include 364 schools, 67 public clinics, 15 hospitals, 83 railroad stations, 22 oil facilities, 93 water facilities and 69 electrical facilities. did you know that 96% of iraqi children under the age of 5 have received the first 2 series of polio vaccinations? did you know that 4.3 million iraqi children were enrolled in primary school by mid october? did you know that there are 1,192,000 cell phone subscribers in iraq and phone use has gone up 158%? did you know that iraq has an independent media that consist of 75 radio stations, 180 newspapers and 10 television stations? did you know that the baghdad stock exchange opened in june of 2004? did you know that 2 candidates in the iraqi presidential election had a recent televised debate recently? of course we didn’t know! why didn’t we know? our media wouldn’t tell us! because a bush-hating media and democratic party would rather see the world blow up than lose their power. instead of shouting these accomplishments from every rooftop, they would rather show photos of what a few perverted malcontent soldiers have done in prisons in many cases never disclosing the circumstances surrounding the events. instead of showing our love for our country, we get photos of flag burning incidents at abu ghraib and people throwing snowballs at presidential motorcades. the lack of accentuating the positive in iraq serves only one purpose. it undermines the world’s perception of the united states and our soldiers. i am ashamed of my fellow americans who would rather see terrorism succeed than a republican president.

https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/wake-up-america/	editorial criticizes barack obamas political stances.	wake up america! i received this forward and wondered if it is accurate. something to think about, an article by a black columnist. ken blackwell – columnist for the new york sun it’s an amazing time to be alive in america. we’re in a year of firsts in this presidential election: the first viable woman candidate; the first viable african-american candidate; and, a candidate who is the first frontrunning freedom fighter over 70. the next president of america will be a first. we won’t truly be in an election of firsts, however, until we judge every candidate by where they stand. we won’t arrive where we should be until we no longer talk about skin color or gender. now that barack obama steps to the front of the democratic field, we need to stop talking about his race, and start talking about his policies and his politics. the reality is this: though the democrats will not have a nominee until august, unless hillary clinton drops out, mr. obama is now the frontrunner, and its time america takes a closer and deeper look at him. some pundits are calling him the next john f. kennedy. he’s not. he’s the next george mcgovern. and it’s time people learned the facts. because the truth is that mr. obama is the single most liberal senator in the entire u.s. senate. he is more liberal than ted kennedy, bernie sanders, or mrs. clinton. never in my life have i seen a presidential frontrunner whose rhetoric is so far removed from his record. walter mondale promised to raise our taxes, and he lost. george mcgovern promised military weakness, and he lost. michael dukakis promised a liberal domestic agenda, and he lost. yet mr. obama is promising all those things, and he’s not behind in the polls. why? because the press has dealt with him as if he were in a beauty pageant.

https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/precious-lord/	in response to the death of his wife and child, tommy dorsey wrote the song precious lord.	back in 1932 i was 32 years old and a fairly new husband. my wife, nettie and i were living in a little apartment on chicago’s southside. one hot august afternoon i had to go to st. louis, where i was to be the featured soloist at a large revival meeting. i didn’t want to go. nettie was in the last month of pregnancy with our first child. but a lot of people were expecting me in st. louis. i kissed nettie good-bye, clattered downstairs to our model a and, in a fresh lake michigan breeze, chugged out of chicago on route 66. however, outside the city, i discovered that in my anxiety at leaving, had forgotten my music case. i wheeled around and headed back. i found nettie sleeping peacefully. i hesitated by her bed; something was strongly telling me to stay. but eager to get on my way, and not wanting to disturb nettie, i shrugged off the feeling and quietly slipped out of the room with my music. the next night, in the steaming st. louis heat, the crowd called on me to sing again and again. when i finally sat down, a messenger boy ran up with a western union telegram. i ripped open the envelope. pasted on the yellow sheet were the words: your wife just died. people were happily singing and clapping around me, but i could hardly keep from crying out. i rushed to a phone and called home. all i could hear on the other end was “nettie is dead. nettie is dead.” when i got back, i learned that nettie had given birth to a boy. i swung between grief and joy. yet that night, the baby died. i buried nettie and our little boy together, in the same casket. then i fell apart. for days i closeted myself. i felt that god had done me an injustice. i didn’t want to serve him any more or write gospel songs. i just wanted to go back to that jazz world i once knew so well. but then, as i hunched alone in that dark apartment those first sad days, i thought back to the afternoon i went to st. louis. something kept telling me to stay with nettie. was that something god? oh, if i had paid more attention to him that day, i would have stayed and been with nettie when she died. from that moment on i vowed to listen more closely to him. but still i was lost in grief. everyone was kind to me, especially a friend, professor fry, who seemed to know what i needed. on the following saturday evening he took me up to malone’s poro college, a neighborhood music school. it was quiet; the late evening sun crept through the curtained windows. i sat down at the piano, and my hands began to browse over the keys. something happened to me then i felt at peace. i feel as though i could reach out and touch god. i found myself playing a melody, one i’d never heard or played before, and the words into my head-they just seemed to fall into place: precious lord, take my hand, lead me on, let me stand! i am tired, i am weak, i am worn, through the storm, through the night lead me on to the light, take my hand, precious lord, lead me home. the lord gave me these words and melody, he also healed my spirit. i learned that when we are in our deepest grief, when we feel farthest from god, this is when he is closest, and when we are most open to his restoring power. and so i go on living for god willingly and joyfully, until that day comes when he will take me and gently lead me home. -tommy dorsey did you know that tommy dorsey wrote this song? i sure didn’t. what a wonderful story of how god can heal the brokenhearted. p.s. beautiful, isn’t it?

https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/obama-tidal-wave/	email presents bill browns assessment of barack obamas political record.	bill brown, is a highly respected retired member of the billy graham team. bill brown, is a highly respected retired member of the billy graham team so, i take his assessment of obama very seriously and for that reason accept his challenge to pass this on. i share his concern about the ‘rock star’ image obama has and watch with growing concern at the celebrity status the media has foisted upon him. here is hope this email informs you in a wise way. the obama tidal wave we are witnessing a political phenomenon with barack obama of rare magnitude. his speeches have inspired millions and yet most of his followers have no idea of what he stands for except platitudes of ‘change’ or that he says he will be a ‘uniter’. the power of speech from a charismatic person truly can be a powerful thing. certainly billy graham had charisma and both his manner of speech and particularly the content changed millions. on the extreme other hand, the charisma of adolph hitler inspired millions and the results were catastrophic. barack obama certainly is no hitler or a billy graham, but for many americans out there feeling just like a surfer who might be ecstatic and euphoric while riding a tidal wave, the real story is what happens when it hits shore . just some of what defines barack obama: . he voted against banning partial birth abortion. . he voted no on notifying parents of minors who get out-of-state abortions. . supports affirmative action in colleges and government. . in 2001 he questioned harsh penalties for drug dealing. . says he will deal with street level drug dealing as minimum wage affair. . admitted marijuana and cocaine use in high school and in college. . his religious convictions are very murky. . he is willing to meet with fidel castro, hugo chavez, kim jung il and mahmoud ahmadinejad. . has said that one of his first goals after being elected would be to have a conference with all muslim nations. . opposed the patriot act. . first bill he signed that was passed was campaign finance reform. . voted no on prohibiting law suits against gun manufacturers. . supports universal health-care. . voted yes on providing habeas corpus for guantanamo detainees. . supports granting driver’s licenses to illegal immigrants. . supports extending welfare to illegal immigrants. . voted yes on comprehensive immigration reform. . voted yes on allowing illegal aliens to participate in social security. . wants to make the minimum wage a ‘living wage’. . voted with democratic party 96 percent of 251 votes. . is a big believer in the separation of church and state. . opposed to any efforts to privatize social security and instead supports increasing the amount of tax paid. . he voted no on repealing the alternative minimum tax. . he voted no on repealing the ‘death’ tax. . he wants to raise the capital gains tax. . has repeatedly said the surge in iraq has not succeeded. . he is ranked as the most liberal senator in the senate today and that takes some doing. if your political choices are consistent with barack obama’s and you think that his positions will bring america together or make it a better place, then you will probably enjoy the ride and not forward this email. if you are like most americans that after examining what he stands for, are truly not in line with his record, it would be prudent to get off the wave or better yet, never get on, before it comes on shore and undermines the very foundations of this great country. we have limited time to save america or the supreme court as we know it. inaction is action. if you agree this is important, pass it on. the mainstream media will not do it for you! bill brown may god bless you and yours	['barack obama']		David Mikkelson	['http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=109&session=2&vote=00229', 'http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=110&session=1&vote=00100', 'http://www.ontheissues.org/SenateVote/Party_2006-216.htm', 'http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=110&session=2&vote=00078', 'http://www.ontheissues.org/Social/Barack_Obama_Principles_+_Values.htm#Religion', 'http://www.ontheissues.org/Domestic/Barack_Obama_Drugs.htm', 'http://www.ontheissues.org/Domestic/Barack_Obama_Civil_Rights.htm#Affirmative_Action', 'http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=109&session=2&vote=00157', 'http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=110&session=2&vote=00043', 'http://web.archive.org/web/20071217053750/http://money.cnn.com/news/newsfeeds/articles/prnewswire/NYTH07513122007-1.htm', 'http://www.ontheissues.org/Social/Barack_Obama_Abortion.htm']

https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/washington-monument/	item cites religious references related to george washington and the washington monument.	washington continues to give praise to god on the aluminum cap atop the washington monument in washington, dc are two words: laus deo. no one can see these words. in fact, most visitors to the monument have no idea they are even there and…for that matter…probably couldn’t care less! but there they are…5.125 inches high … perched atop the monument to the father of our nation. the washington monument is 55 feet wide at the base and 555 feet tall, overlooking the 69 square miles which comprise the district of columbia, capital of the united states of america. it is made of 36,000 stones of marble (from maryland) and granite (from maine) and weighs 90,000 tons. the monument sees about 800,000 visitors a year. laus deo! two seemingly insignificant, unnoticed words … out of sight and, one might think, out of mind … but very meaningfully placed at the highest point over what is the most powerful city in the world. and what might those two words … composed of just four syllables and only seven letters … mean? very simply … “praise be to god!” though construction of this giant obelisk began in 1848 when james polk was president of the united states, it was not until 1888 that the monument was inaugurated and opened to the public. it took twenty-five years to finally cap the memorial with the tribute laus deo! praise be to god! from atop this magnificent granite and marble structure … a visitor can take in the beautiful panoramic view of the city with its division into four major segments. and from that vantage point one can also easily see the original plan of the designer, pierre charles l’enfant … a perfect cross imposed upon the landscape … with the white house to the north, the jefferson memorial to the south, the capitol to the east, and the lincoln memorial to the west. a cross … you say? how interesting! and … no doubt … intended to carry a meaning for those who bother to notice. praise be to god! one interesting feature is the interior iron stairway with 50 landings and 897 stone steps. these donated stones come from every state in the union, as well as native american nations and foreign countries. while the stairwell has been closed since the 1970s, visitors can gain access to the top observation area via elevator. as one climbs the steps and pauses at the landings the memorial stones share a message. on the 12th landing is a prayer offered by the city of baltimore; on the 20th is a memorial presented by some chinese christians; on the 24th a presentation made by sunday school children from new york and philadelphia quoting proverbs 10:7, luke 18:16 and proverbs 22:6. praise be to god! when the cornerstone of the washington monument was laid on july 4th, 1848 deposited within it were many items including the holy bible presented by the bible society. praise be to god! such was the discipline, the moral direction, the spiritual mood given by the founder and first president of our unique democracy .. “one nation, under god.” i am awed by washington’s prayer for america. have you never read it? well now is your opportunity … read on! “almighty god; we make our earnest prayer that thou wilt keep the united states in thy holy protection; that thou wilt incline the hearts of the citizens to cultivate a spirit of subordination and obedience to government; and entertain a brotherly affection and love for one another and for their fellow citizens of the united states at large. and finally that thou wilt most graciously be pleased to dispose us all to do justice, to love mercy, and to demean ourselves with that charity, humility, and pacific temper of mind which were the characteristics of the divine author of our blessed religion, and without a humble imitation of whose example in these things we can never hope to be a happy nation. grant our supplication, we beseech thee, through jesus christ our lord. amen.” laus deo! as you might have guessed … i kind of like the idea that our pledge of allegiance includes the phrase “under god.” it is clear when one studies the history of our great nation that washington’s america was one of the few countries in all the world established under the guidance, direction and banner of almighty god, to whom was given all praise, honor and worship by the great men who formed and fashioned her pivotal foundations. and when one stops to observe the inscriptions found in public places all over our nation’s capitol … one will easily find the signature of god. we are a nation under god!!! laus deo!!! praise be to god!!!

https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/black-american-hero/	black leaders are planning a big event to honor stan tookie williams.	the reverend jesse jackson and bruce gordon (the new president of naacp) are planning a big event to honor a very special hero of the black community. this event is expected to draw 15,000 people and will probably be held in the los angeles memorial coliseum. who is this black american hero they are planning to honor? is it colin powell, the first black 4-star general, first black chairman of the joint chiefs, first black man to be secretary of state, and first black man who could be president if only he wanted to be? no. it’s not him. is it clarence thomas, the first black man to sit on the supreme court of the united states? nope. is it dr. condoleeza rice, stanford professor and the first black woman to serve as secretary of state. nope, not her. is it guy bluford, the first black nasa astronaut who flew for 8 days in space? nope. not him. is it ron mcnair, the second black nasa astronaut (who died in the space shuttle challenger disaster)?? nope. not good enough. is it dr. walter williams, distinguished professor of economics at george mason university, and another truly inspiring black american? nope. is it dr. thomas sowell, distinguished professor from stanford university? no. is it richard pryor, a real national treasure, who passed away just this week? nope, not him either… i could go on and on. there are thousands and thousands of truly amazing black americans who deserve an honor like this…. so who is it that the reverend jackson and the naacp plan to honor??? which black icon is going to draw 15,000 people to honor him???? it’s none other than stan “tookie” williams, the thieving murdering thug who founded the crips gang — the coward who killed a little old lady with a shotgun blast to her face. this guy was so rotten and vile that they had to put him to sleep to get rid of him once and for all. that’s who. that’s who is being honored. that’s the role model for our young people…. i guess they went down the list until they found somebody, who didn’t threaten to sue them, if they were mentioned in the same paragraph as jesse jackson or bruce gordon.

https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/canadian-health-care/	email offers information about the canadian health care system.	this was sent from canada to a friend in the states. i saw on the news up here in canada where hillary clinton introduced her new health care plan. something similar to what we have in canada. i also heard that michael moore was raving about the health care up here in canada in his latest movie. as your friend and someone who lives with the canada health care plan i thought i would give you some facts about this great medical plan that we have in canada. first of all: 1) the health care plan in canada is not free. we pay a premium every month of $96 for shirley and i to be covered. sounds great eh. what they don’t tell you is how much we pay in taxes to keep the health care system afloat. i am personally in the 55% tax bracket. yes 55% of my earnings go to taxes. a large portion of that and i am not sure of the exact amount goes directly to health care our #1 expense. 2) i would not classify what we have as health care plan, it is more like a health diagnosis system. you can get into to see a doctor quick enough so he can tell you “yes indeed you are sick or you need an operation” but now the challenge becomes getting treated or operated on. we have waiting lists out the ying yang some as much as 2 years down the road. 3) rather than fix what is wrong with you the usual tactic in canada is to prescribe drugs. have a pain here is a drug to take — not what is causing the pain and why. no time for checking you out because it is more important to move as many patients thru as possible each hour for government re-imbursement 4) many canadians do not have a family doctor. 5) don’t require emergency treatment as you may wait for hours in the emergency room waiting for treatment. 6) shirley’s dad cut his hand on a power saw a few weeks back and it required that his hand be put in a splint – to our surprise we had to pay $125 for a splint because it is not covered under health care plus we have to pay $60 for each visit for him to check it out each week. 7) shirley’s cousin was diagnosed with a heart blockage. put on a waiting list. died before he could get treatment. 8) government allots so many operations per year. when that is done no more operations, unless you go to your local newspaper and plead your case and embarrass the government then money suddenly appears. 9) the government takes great pride in telling us how much more they are increasing the funding for health care but waiting lists never get shorter. government just keeps throwing money at the problem but it never goes away. but they are good at finding new ways to tax us, but they don’t call it a tax anymore it is now a user fee. 10) a friend needs an operation for a blockage in her leg but because she is a smoker they will not do it. despite paying into the health care system all these years. my friend is 65 years old. now there is talk that maybe we should not treat fat and obese people either because they are a drain on the health care system. let me see now, what we want in canada is a health care system for healthy people only. that should reduce our health care costs. 11) forget getting a second opinion, what you see is what you get. 12) i can spend what money i have left after taxes on booze, cigarettes, junk food and anything else that could kill me but i am not allowed by law to spend my money on getting an operation i need because that would be jumping the queue. i must wait my turn except if i am a hockey player or athlete then i can get looked at right away. go figger. where else in the world can you spend money to kill yourself but not allowed to spend money to get healthy. 13) oh did i mention that immigrants are covered automatically at tax payer expense having never contributed a dollar to the system and pay no premiums. 14) oh yeh we now give free needles to drug users to try and keep them healthy. wouldn’t want a sickly druggie breaking into your house and stealing your things. but people with diabetes who pay into the health care system have to pay for their needles because it is not covered but the health care system. i send this out not looking for sympathy but as the election looms in the states you will be hearing more and more about universal health care down there and the advocates will be pointing to canada. i just want to make sure that you hear the truth about health care up here and have some food for thought and informed questions to ask when broached with this subject. step wisely and don’t make the same mistakes we have.

https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/pagets-disease/	pagets disease of the nipple is a real but uncommon form of breast cancer.	is a rare form of breast cancer, and is on the outside of the breast, on the nipple and areola, it appears as a rash which later becomes a lesion with a crusty outer edge. i would not have ever suspected it to be breast cancer but it was. my nipple never seemed any different to me, but the rash bothered me so went to my doctor’s office for that. sometimes it itched and was sore but other than that it didn’t really bother me, was just ugly and a nuisance, and would not clear up with all the creams given by doctor and dermatologist for the dermatitis on my eyes that i had just had prior to this outbreak. therefore i went in to doctors office for further assistance. they seemed a little concerned but did not warn me it could be cancerous. i suspect there are not many women out there who know a lesion or rash on the nipple or areola can be breast cancer. what are the symptoms? mine started out as a single red pimple on the areola. one of the biggest problems with paget’s disease of the nipple is that the symptoms appear to be harmless. it is frequently thought to be a skin inflammation or infections, leading to unfortunate delays in detection and care. the symptoms include: a persistent redness, oozing, and crusting of your nipple causing it to itch and burn. (as i stated mine did not itch much or burn, and no oozing was i aware of, but it did have a crust along the outer edge on one side.) a sore on your nipple that will not heal. (mine was on the areola area with a whitish thick looking area in the center of my nipple.) usually only one nipple is affected. how is it diagnosed? your doctor will do a physical exam, and should suggest having a mammogram of both breasts done immediately. even though the redness, oozing and crusting closely resemble dermatitis (inflammation of the skin), your doctor should suspect cancer if the sore is only on one breast. your doctor should order a biopsy of your sore to confirm what is going on. they will take a sample of your breast tissue in that area to test for cancer. if the cancer is only in the nipple and not in the breast, your doctor may recommend just removing the nipple and surrounding tissue or suggest radiation treatments. had my doctor caught mine right away, instead of flaking it off as dermatitis perhaps they could of saved my breast and it wouldn’t have gone to my lymph nodes. this message should be taken seriously and passed on to as many of your friends as possible, it could save someone’s life. my breast cancer has spread and metastasized to my bones, this after chemotherapy, 28 treatments of radiation and taking tamaxofin. if this had been diagnosed in the beginning as breast cancer and treated right away perhaps it would not have spread … i did try to spread the word through rosie o’donnell show on breast cancer awareness but it failed to trigger enough importance to receive an announcement on her show last year. this is sad as women are not aware of paget’s disease. if by passing this around on the e-mail we can make others aware of it and it’s potential danger we are helping women everywhere. please send this to all the women you care about; cancer can be fought if we are all aware! thanks for taking the time to share.
