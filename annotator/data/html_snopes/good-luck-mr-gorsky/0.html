We have removed a number of short-duration film and video clips from this page and -- with one exception for a higher-resolution view of the contingency sample collection -- retained only longer-duration clips that combine both the restored television and 16-mm film footage. It is recommended to play the video in a separate, pop-up window so that the reader can scroll along through the text while watching. Links to a number of shorter-duration TV and 16-mm film clips have been retained in the <a href="video11.html" target="new">Apollo 11 Video Library</a>.

Locations from which Hasselblad images were taken (called camera stations) during the EVA are plotted in Vlad Pustynski's <a href="a11photomapVP120124.pdf" target="new">Photogrammetric Map</a> of the landing site and in Brian McInall's <a href="A11_Tranquility_Base_Planimetric_Map-LROC_M17512493R_Feb_2018.jpg" target="new" title="image">Planimetric Map</a> derived from a  simpler, iterative triangulation method.  The <a href="a11Photogrammetry.html" target="new">photogrammetric analysis</a> is labor intensive but produces high-accuracy results.  The triangulation method is not as labor intensive and particularly well suited to mapping the geology stations visited by the later crews.  The Apollo 11 site provides an opportunity compare the relative accuracy to the two methods.

</p><blockquote><i>[During November 1995, a clever (and slightly risqué) story was widely circulated on the Internet concerning a statement Neil is supposed to have made during the Apollo 11 EVA.  At the suggestion of several readers, let me state that Neil never said "Good luck, Mr. Gorsky" at any time during the mission.  Indeed, on November 28, 1995, Neil wrote for the ALSJ, "I understand that the joke is a year old.  I first heard it in California delivered by (comedian) Buddy Hackett".]</i></blockquote>

<b>109:15:45</b> Aldrin: Okay.  About ready to go down and get some Moon rock?</p><p>
<b>109:15:47</b> Armstrong: My <a href="../alsj-PLSSOPSantenna.html" target="new">(PLSS) antenna</a>'s out.  (Pause)</p><p>
<b><a name="1091555">109:15:55</a></b> Armstrong: Now we're ready to hook up the <a href="../alsj-lec.html" target="new">LEC</a> here.  (Pause)

</p><blockquote><i>[During a <a href="a11PostFlightPressConf.html" target="new">post-mission press conference</a>, Neil referred to the Lunar Equipment Conveyor (LEC) as a "Brooklyn clothesline".  In a 2004 e-mail, he referred to it as the "Irish Washerwoman" and wrote, "The LEC idea came from the clotheslines on pulleys outside the windows of  New York apartments."  The LEC is a long nylon strap with a hook at each end so that it could be formed into a continuous loop.  The strap ran around a pulley attached to a fitting in the cabin ceiling and out through the hatch to the Commander on the surface. Equipment could be attached to the hooks for transport between the cabin and the surface.]</i><p>

[A 1939 <a href="a11clothesline.jpg" target="new" title="image">photograph</a> by Sid Grossman - from the collection of the Museum of the City of New York - shows clotheslines in Harlem, NYC. Although such clotheslines were not unique to Brooklyn nor to New York, they were usually associated with poorer, immigrant neighborhoods and, because New York had a large immigrant population from the start of the great Irish migration of the 1840s onward, clotheslines strung between buildings was often thought of as a characteristic of the city.]</p><p>

[A detailed discussion of the LEC with photographs is linked <a href="../alsj-lec.html" target="new">here</a>.]</p><p><i>

[Here, they are attaching the snap hook on Neil's neckring tiedown strap to  the LEC.  A complete discussion is linked <a href="a11tether.html" target="new">here</a>.]</i></p></blockquote>
<b><a name="1091612">109:16:12</a></b> Aldrin: All right.  That should go down with no twists now.  Put the (LEC stowage) bag up this way.  That's even.  Okay, are you hooked up to it?

<blockquote><i>[According to <a href="a11lsp40.jpg" target="new" title="document page">page 40</a> in the Final Apollo 11 Lunar Surface Procedures volume, Neil will "Move through hatch (with LEC tethered)" while Buzz will "Play out LEC and use as safety tether".  Later (<a href="a11lsp41.jpg" target="new" title="document page">page 41</a>), when Neil starts his period of Environmental Familiarization, he will "Detach and temporarily stow LEC on gear strut or ladder".]</i></blockquote>
<b>109:16:26</b> Armstrong: Hmm?  (Pause)  Okay.  Now we need to hook this...<p>
<b>109:16:30</b> Aldrin: Yeah.  Move that up there.

</p><blockquote><i>[This may be a further LEC reference.]</i></blockquote>

<blockquote><i>[Neil is about to start the intricate process of getting down on his knees, with his back to Buzz, and then maneuver his feet toward the hatch and get himself in position to get out through the hatch.]</i><p>

[The small area available to the crew at the front of the cabin is best illustrated by images taken during final Apollo 16 (LM 11, Orion) and Apollo 17 (LM 12, Challenger) LM close-out on the pad at the Cape prior to launch.]</p><p>

[A <a href="../a16/LM11-co42.jpg" target="new" title="image">view from above</a> shows the LMP's PLSS (without the OPS) and two helmet bags (containing the LEVAs) filling the space.  As detailed on <a href="../LM04_Lunar_Module_ppLV1-17.pdf" target="new">pages LV-4 and 5</a> in the Lunar Module News Reference, the useable floor area measures about 55 inches (140 cm) from side to side and about 36 inches (91 cm) from the hatch to the base of the 18-inch (46 cm) 'midstep' behind the crew stations.  Note that the <a href="../Apollo_PLSS_Dimensions.jpg" target="new">PLSS dimensions</a> are about 26 inches (66 cm) long, 19 inches (48 cm) wide, 9.5 (24 cm) inches thick at the base, and 8.75 (22 cm) inches thick at the top.  The photographer was standing on the midstep, with its edge near the bottom of the frame.]</p><p><i>

[An <a href="../a16/LM11-co43.jpg" target="new" title="image">Apollo 16 frame</a> taken through the open hatch shows a member of the close-out team standing on tiptoes on the midstep, with the ECS on his right and stowed items behind the Commander's station on his left.  A similar <a href="../a17/LM12-co29.jpg" target="new" title="image">Apollo 17 frame</a> shows a member of the close-out team sitting on the Ascent Engine cover.  Finally, an <a href="../a16/LM11-co3.jpg" target="new" title="image">Apollo 16 frame</a> shows the top of the engine cover with Velcro strips and cloth straps where the LM crew secured the helmet bags after re-installing the drogue and probe in preparation for undocking from the CSM.]</i></p></blockquote>

<b>109:17:26</b> Armstrong: The what hinge?

<blockquote><i>[The <a href="../a12/A12Flown-Purse.html" target="new">purse</a> is a temporary stowage bag hanging at the front of the cabin below Panel 5 to the left of the hatch.  In order to get out, Neil has turned to face the left rear of the cabin and, primarily with his hands, has lowered himself as he got his feet out through the hatch far enough that he could kneel on the cabin floor.  After getting to his knees and getting centered in the hatch, he inches himself backwards, using Buzz's guidance to get his backpack under the DSKY (Display and Keyboard) panel over the hatch.  He has to be careful to avoid bumping his head on the midstep and scratching his visor.]</i><p><i>

[The only hinges that come to mind are the two hatch hinges on Buzz's side.  As can be seen in <a href="a11VirtualLMForwardHatch.jpg" target="new" title="image">views</a>  from Scott Sullivan's invaluable </i>Virtual LM<i>, the hinges are entirely in the cabin. What may be happening is that Neil's left foot may be getting into the space between the hinge edge of the hatch and the surface in the opening where it seats when the hatch is closed.  See a <a href="a11HatchDetail5862HR.jpg" target="new" title="image">detail  from AS11-40-5862</a>, which is Neil first photo of Buzz's egress.</i></p></blockquote>

<blockquote><i>[Armstrong, from the 1969 Technical Debrief - "I guess the most important thing here with respect to the egress through the hatch and the work on the ladder and the platform (porch) is that our simulation work in both the tank and in the (one-sixth-g) airplane was a reasonably accurate simulation.  They were adequate to learn to do the job and we didn't have any big surprises in that area.  The things that we'd learned about body positioning, arching the back, clearances required, and one person helping another and so on worked just like the real case.  There weren't any difficulties in movement through the hatch or with stability on the porch."]</i><p><i>

[Training photo  <a href="ap11-S69-39269.jpg" target="new" title="image">S69-39269</a> shows Buzz in the KC-135 aircraft with a mockup of the hatch and porch in the background.]</i></p></blockquote>

<font color="red">EMU:</font> Go ahead Flight.<br/>
<font color="red">Flight:</font> What is the reason for the differences in the LCG or inlet temperatures between the two?<br/>
<font color="red">EMU:</font> Well, right now the LMP's in the max diverter valve position. That's why it took so long to get his sublimator going. Commander went to ... after the warning tone went off, (he) went up to intermediate. And it's a lower heat load to the sublimator.<br/>

In Summary: Houston gets a modest amount of telemetry from the PLSS, including electrocardiogram readouts, suit pressure, carbon dioxide partial pressure, battery voltage and current, oxygen bottle pressure, temperatures at the inlet to the Liquid Cooled Garment (LCG) and the outlet to the PLSS sublimator, and a temperature difference between the LCG inlet and outlet. Houston does not have a direct indication of the status of the vent window - which shows a "P" warning when the oxygen flow is below about 5 cubic feet per minute.The PLSS pump circulates water through a network of thin tubes woven into the Liquid Cooled Garment or LCG. This is a closed-loop water supply which carries excess body heat to the sublimator where the heat is transferred to a supply of feedwater which is subsequently evaporated to provide overall cooling.The sublimator consists of a sandwich of honeycomb plates on which, when exposed to vacuum, the feedwater turns to ice and it is the sublimation of the ice layer that provides cooling.]</i></p></blockquote></blockquote>
<b>109:17:54</b> Armstrong: Okay.  Now I'm going to check ingress here.  (Pause)

<blockquote><i>[Armstrong - "I'm right in position (on the porch) and now I'm going to have to go back, in a check, maybe, of just clearance going through the hatch.  That's what I think it is."]</i><p>

[Armstrong, from the 1969 Technical Debrief - "After getting onto the porch, I came back into the LM and went up around the Z-27 corner, made sure that was as expected, and it was."]</p><p><i>

[Neil statement that he 'went up around the Z-27 corner' is probably a reference his head high enough to clear the <a href="../LMRHSCutAway.jpg" target="new" title="image">plus Z-27 bulkhead</a> that separates the front the cabin from the back, just in front of the ascent engine cover.  Once he does that, he can get to his knees and stand.

After getting the jettison bag from Buzz, he drops it to the surface and later, will push it under the descent stage to get it out of the way.]</i></blockquote>

The Goddard recording of the HSK feed linked above is properly oriented.]</i><p>

[Armstrong - "We wanted to make sure the picture was adequate so that we didn't have to take the time to unpack that (S-band) antenna and unfold it.  It was pretty good size.  I'd say it's maybe eight feet across."]</p><p>

[This was the S-Band antenna that was deployed on 12 and 14.  On Apollo 11, it was stowed in <a href="a11quads.jpg" target="new" title="mage">LM Quad I</a> to the right of the ladder. Journal Contributor Bill Wood writes, "The plan was to only ask  for deployment of the erectable S-band antenna if the signal through the LM  high-gain antenna was not good enough.  The decision to carry the dish was made several months before the mission when there was concern that it might not be possible to handle the EVA through the Goldstone DSS-14 antenna due to a conflict with an on-going DSN (Deep Space Network) mission.  However, that proved not to be a limitation.  Of course, if the  EVA occurred over Spain or if either DSS-14 nor Parkes was available, the  erectable dish would have been used.  Neil Armstrong was aware of this and  made a point to check the received TV quality so he would know whether or  not he would need to unstow the dish."]</p><p>

[Bill Wood calls attention to the following material from <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4205/ch13-4.html" target="new">Chariots for Apollo</a> by Courtney G Brooks, James M. Grimwood, Lloyd S. Swenson: "One item of worldwide public impact - television - raised no issues whatsoever on this flight. Slayton even urged the need for some kind of erectable antenna. The crewmen could not, after all, be expected to wait patiently in the lander until the earth moved Goldstone,  California, and its 64-meter radar dish into line with the spacecraft - before they climbed out onto the surface. There was also some question whether the Goldstone facility would be available, since it was needed for a Mariner flyby of Mars in July. At a management council meeting in March, the prospect of doing without the big  California dish, as well as a similar one at Parkes,  Australia, forced agreement on a contingency plan for a portable antenna. Eventually, both Goldstone and Parkes were free to cover Apollo 11, but proper alignment with Goldstone was still a problem. Low decided to delay the lunar module's descent by one revolution to make sure 'that we will have Goldstone coverage.' If the launch was delayed and if Parkes was better situated to pick up the signals, the relay would travel from the lunar module to Parkes, to  Sydney by microwave, across the  Pacific Ocean via synchronous satellite Intelsat III, to the control center in  Houston, to the television networks, and thence to television sets throughout most of the world. Goldstone would shorten that route."]</p><p>

["Some Apollo managers were worrying about the quality of the pictures they could expect. Looking at a photograph of a simulation, Phillips observed to Low that the first step onto the lunar surface might be in the shadows. And the light might be too bright in the stowage area, as the astronauts unloaded the experiments package. Phillips asked Low to see about this, since 'sharing with the world our historical first steps onto the moon warrants our efforts to maximize this return.' Low did not believe the results would be as bad as Phillips feared, but  Houston set up scale models under various lighting conditions to make sure of good coverage of the crewman as he descended to the lunar surface. Before he left  Houston, <a href="../PaulHaney.html" target="new">Paul Haney</a> had suggested that the surface camera be set up to photograph the liftoff from the moon. The idea was exciting, but it was too late to arrange it for Apollo 11. It would have to wait for a future mission."]</p><p>

[Returning to the 1991 mission review, I then asked Neil about the relative priority of the TV.]</p><p>

[Armstrong - "I was fully prepared to deploy the antenna, and I practiced with it a bunch of times so I wouldn't call it low priority.  But we were glad that we didn't have to take the time to do that."]</p><p><i>

[The reason that the picture is upside down is that the camera was mounted upside down on the MESA (as can be seen in a <a href="a11TVCameraMESA.jpg" target="new" title="image">training image</a>).  Each of the tracking stations had the capability of inverting the image so it would look normal.  This was done by throwing a switch from the 'normal' position - used when the camera was on its tripod away from the LM and was, therefore, rightside up - to the 'inverted' position - used when the camera was upside down on the MESA.  As John Sarkissian relates below, the Goldstone switch hadn't been set to 'inverted'.  The HSK feed linked above is correctly oriented because the HSK switch was in the proper position.]</i></p></blockquote>

[Briefly, when Buzz closed the TV circuit breaker at 109:22 (02:54 GMT), the Moon was at an azimuth/elevation of 76/28 at Honeysuckle and 226/36 at Goldstone, so good signals were being received at both stations.  As planned, the Goldstone signal was used initially.  However, because the signal quality at Honeysuckle proved to be superior, a switch was made and the Honeysuckle signal was used until the moon rose high enough at Parkes that its big dish (64 meter diameter versus only 26 meters at Honeysuckle) could get a good signal.  The Goldstone audio signal was used throughout the EVA.]</p><p>

[The times when switching from one signal source to another can be determined by the presence of various, steady white spots present in the TV images.  See the accompanying <a href="a11WhiteSpots.html" target="new">discussion</a>.  Note that a spot that is an unwitting part of the Goldstone signal does not appear in the restored video, not having survived the restoration process.]</p><p>

[Immediately after McCandless responded to Buzz at 109:22:34, the TV image switches to the proper orientation, with the Goldstone spot now above center in the pre-restoration clip.]</p><p>  

[John Sarkissian writes in 2003:  "The toggle switch on the Honeysuckle and Goldstone scan-converters was initially set to the 'normal' position. The Parkes scan-converter - which was being operated by Dick Holl, a Bendix Field Engineering Corp. engineer who helped design the scan-converters - had his toggle switch correctly set to the 'inverted' position as the broadcast began. A few seconds after the broadcast began, Ed von Renouard at HSK (Honeysuckle Creek) realised that the picture at HSK was upside-down and quickly threw the switch on the HSK scan-converter into the correct, 'inverted' position to put the picture the right way up. Goldstone, presumably because their picture was going out live, didn't correct their switch setting until instructed to do so by Houston TV."]</p><p>

["Ed von Renouard was the Honeysuckle Creek Video Technician who operated the HSK scan-converter. Both he and the HSK scan-converter were located in a room deep within the HSK complex. Dick Holl and the Parkes scan-converter were at the OTC (Australia's Overseas Telecommunications Commission) Paddington terminal located on Oxford Street, Paddington (Sydney)."]</p></blockquote><p>

</p><blockquote><i>[Neil jumps down to the footpad again, keeping a two-handed grip on the ladder as he does so. There is no motion of the 16-mm camera evident when he lands on the footpad.]</i><p><i>

[The interior of each of the primary struts contains a piston and a compressible honeycomb structure, as shown in the accompanying <a href="a11lm5strut.jpg" target="new" title="image">diagram</a>. As indicated in the diagram and  drawing of the  <a href="a11landinggear.jpg" target="new" title="image">landing gear</a>, full compression of the honeycomb structure in a hard landing would have shortened the primary strut by 32 inches ( 81 cm). Journal Contributor Harald Kucharek notes that, as can be seen on pages 81, 119, and others in Scott Sullivan's </i>Virtual LM<i>, the bottom of the ladder was attached to the primary strut just above the point where the lower part of the strut could slide into the upper part.  Consequently, full compression of the primary strut would have left the bottom rung of the ladder just above the footpad. However, there was never any significant compression ( "stroking" ) of any of the struts in any of the landings, so the astronauts had to contend with a jump of slightly more than 32 inches. Fortunately, one-sixth gravity made it relatively easy. All you needed to do was give a little push with the legs and, with your hands on the outside rail, guide yourself up.]</i></p><p><i>

[Armstrong, from the 1969 Technical Debrief - "The work and effort required to go up and down the ladder and in through the hatch are not objectionable enough that they need to be worried about.

<b>109:24:23</b> Armstrong: That's one small step for (a) man;  one giant leap for mankind.  (Long Pause)

<blockquote><i>[At the time of the mission, the world heard Neil say "That's one small step for man; one giant leap for mankind". As Andrew Chaikin details in </i>A Man on the Moon<i>, after the mission, Neil said that he had intended to say 'one small step for a man' and believed that he had done so. However, he also agreed that the 'a' didn't seem to be audible in the recordings. The important point is that the world had no problem understanding his meaning. However, over the decades, people interested in details of the mission - including your editor - have listened repeatedly to the recordings, without hearing any convincing evidence of the 'a'. In 2006, with a great deal of attendant media attention, journalist/ entrepreneur Peter Shann Ford claimed to have located the 'a' in the waveform of Neil's transmission. Subsequently, more rigorous analyses of the transmission were undertaken by people with professional experience with audio waveforms and, most importantly, audio spectrograms. None of these analyses support Ford's conclusion. The transcription used above honors Neil's intent.]</i><p>

[The raw NASA transcript give the start of this transmission as 109:24:48, which is clearly inconsistent with what has gone before.  The Apollo 11 Mission Report gives "initial contact" as 109:24:15 or 02:56:15 GMT/UTC on 21 July 1969.  Later in the mission, NASA tells the press that the first step came at 109:24:20. An examination of the restored video indicates that, to the extent that the audio and video tracks are properly synched, Neil puts his left foot firmly on the surface five seconds after the start of his transmission "I'm going to step off the LM now." and six seconds before he starts to say "That's one small step."   In June 2011, Journal Contributor Heiko Küffen used the audio track that accompanies the restored video to revise times between 109:20:56 and 109:27:29.  Except for the time of "That's one small step" and the transmission that follows - "Yes, the surface is fine and powdery" - there are no differences greater than 2 seconds between Heiko's analysis and the times then given in the ALSJ.  I have repeated Heiko's analysis and confirm his results to within 2 seconds. In particular, Heiko gets 109:24:14 for "I'm going to step off the LM now." and I get 109:24:12.  The difference is unimportant when compared with other uncertainties.  My analysis is based on the time of hatch opening (given as 109:07:33 in the Mission report), which seems to be relatively certain.]</p><p>

[Based on the times of transmissions prior to 109:24:12, Neil started to say "I'm going to step" at 109:24:12, stepped firmly on the surface at 109:24:17, and started "That's one small step" at 109:24:23.  Readers interested in the exact timing of events in these transcripts should note that there are notable inconsistencies in the times given in the original NASA transcripts.  Clearly, over longer intervals, times in the original transcripts are only suggestive.  Discontinuous jumps in the original transcripts occur at notable mission events and elsewhere, probably at the end of tapes or tape segments used by individual transcribers. Over intervals of several minutes, the best audio clips can be used to get relative accuracies of 2-3 seconds.]</p><p><i>

<b>109:26:54</b> Armstrong: Okay, Buzz, we ready to bring down the  (</a><a href="a11-hass.html" target="new">70 mm Hasselblad</a>) camera?

<blockquote><i>[The camera is in the ETB which, in turn, is hooked to the LEC.    Both Neil and Buzz have a checklist sewn to the upper part of the left glove that covered the wrist area.  Neil's is shown in NASA photo <a href="ap11-S69-38898HR.jpg" target="new">S69-38898</a> and Buzz's in shown in <a href="ap11-S69-38937HR.jpg" target="new">S69-38937</a>.  The camera transfer is the first item on Neil's <a href="images11.html#neilcuf" target="new"> checklist</a>.]</i><p>

[Armstrong - "I remember that we devised, during the training program, the LEC and the camera mount.  There may have been others, but those are the two that I recall.  The camera mount was something I suggested.  I recall that.  It was a bracket that went on the front of the <a href="../alsj-RCU.html" target="new">RCU</a> to hold the Hasselblads.  It had always been intended that we just, you know, carry a camera like you normally carry a camera, maybe with a strap."]</p><p>

[Aldrin - "With the bracket, one could conceivably take the camera down that way, rather than in the transfer bag."]</p><p>

[I noted that it probably would have been impossible to get through the hatch wearing a camera.  All of the crews chose to send their cameras out in the Equipment Transfer Bag (ETB).]</p><p>

[Armstrong - "That would have been tight.  I don't know."]</p><p>

[Journal Contributor Frank O'Brien notes that the hatch is 32 inches square. Excluding the OPS, the PLSS is about 26 inches tall  and 9.5 inches deep at its base. Neil's photo of Buzz saluting the flag, AS11-40-<a href="AS11-40-5874HR.jpg" target="new">5874</a>, allows us to estimate that the distance from the back of the PLSS to the front of the RCU is about 26 inches.  When mounted on the RCU bracket, the camera adds another 8 inches, giving a total of 34 inches, 2 inches more than the size of the hatch opening.]</p><p>

[Returning to the missions review, I then asked Neil and Buzz about the pre-flight decision to take only one 
<a href="a11-hass.html" target="new">Hasselblad</a> camera out on the EVA.]</p><p>

[Aldrin - "Pretty cheap tourists."]</p><p>

[Armstrong - "We had two (in the cabin), but we just used one (outside)."]</p><p>

[Aldrin - "We left one on the surface, because I remember the gnashing of teeth about leaving a valuable Hasselblad on the surface.  And that was to save weight."]</p><p>

[Armstrong - "My recollection is that we had something - and I was thinking it was a camera, but maybe it was just a film pack - that we could go back up to get if we needed.  We didn't plan to, but if we had an emergency, we could go back up the ladder and retrieve this other."]</p><p>

[See the discussion following <a href="#1093943" target="new">109:39:43</a>.]</p><p>

[Journal Contributor Markus Mehring, from a 13 December 2000 e-mail message - "The second <a href="a11-hass.html" target="new">Hasselblad</a> was not a lunar surface camera. It had a black exterior, designed to suppress stray reflections, and not the silver protective cover added to the EVA cameras for thermal protection.  The second Apollo 11 LM camera was for intravehicular use only and, had it been necessary to use it during the EVA, the photographic record of Apollo 11 would have been seriously compromised."</p><p>

["Because the IVA camera was heat-sensitive, it could only be used in shadow.  If the astronaut carrying it wanted to use it outside the LM shadow, he would have to be sure to keep his own shadow on the camera - an awkward situation - and could not have taken either up-Sun or cross-Sun photos.  The fact that the IVA camera had no <a href="../alsj-reseau.html" target="new">reseau plate</a> would have meant that photogrammetry would not have been possible at all and that there would have been no means of checking the negatives for physical distortion during processing or storage."]</p><p>

["The Apollo Hasselblads were very durable - as a result of the flight-rating process - but I don't think that the black exterior of the IVA camera would have withstood prolonged, direct exposure to sunlight in a vacuum. The IVA camera would have been of only marginal use as an EVA back-up.  Considering this, I think it was an extremely risky decision to fly just one EVA Hasselblad. We know that one of the Apollo 12 EVA cameras became unusable during the second EVA and, to a lesser extent, camera problems were also experienced on Apollos 15 and 17.  Therefore, hindsight suggests that the decision to fly only one EVA camera meant that there was actually a non-negligible chance of having only partial documentation of the first lunar EVA."]</p><p>

[Journal Contributor Ulli Lotzmann notes that the 
<a href="a11-hass.html" target="new">lunar surface Hasselblad</a> was equipped with  a <a href="../Biogon5.6_60mm_ZEISS.pdf" target="new">60-mm Zeiss Biogon lens</a> while the IVA Hasselblad had an 80-mm Zeiss Planar lens.]</p><p>

[Mehring - "If you have a look at the photographs that Neil and Buzz took out the LM windows during the mission  and, also, the pictures they took inside the LM (such as AS11-37-
<a href="AS11-37-5528HR.jpg" target="new" title="image">5528</a>), you'll notice that quite a number of them do not have reseau crosses in them.  These were taken with the black, IVA camera.  Only the cameras designed for EVAs - the silver ones - had a reseau plate, simply because the need to make photogrammetric measurements only existed for surface photographs. You can use this as an ID helper for 70mm photographs throughout the rest of the missions: if a picture has reseau crosses, it's from a silver EVA-Hasselblad; if it hasn't, it's from a black IVA-cam. Note that this is not related to magazines, since the magazines fit on either body,  A particular magazine could contain both photos with and photos without reseau crosses if the magazine was used on two cameras."]</p><p><i>

["Finally, on a cultural note, the black color of the Hasselblads made for NASA was the primary reason why 'black' suddenly became a favored 'professional look', hence almost every commercially available camera was released in black during the subsequent decades. Only recently have the companies begun to be a more creative, producing cameras with metal exteriors of different kinds, and colorful plastics.  This is probably one of the lesser known results of the early manned US-spaceflight program!]</i></p></blockquote>

As soon as you get your helmet into the shadow, you can begin to perceive things and to go through a dark-adaptation process.

In this way, geologists would be guaranteed at least a small sample of lunar soil. The controllers are debating whether to wait for Neil to finish his current task or to remind him immediately of the contingency sample. Since everything is going well, they wait.]

<blockquote><i>[Armstrong, from the 1969 Technical Debrief - "Here, we changed the flight plan somewhat and got the camera down before doing the contingency sample.  I wanted to get that camera down and hooked up (on the RCU) while I was over there in the (LM) shadow, because to do the contingency sample, I was going to have to stow the LEC and go over into the area out of the shadow.  Since I wanted to do it on the right side (that is, Buzz's side of the spacecraft) where the (16mm) camera was mounted (in Buzz's window), I was going to have to make a trip of about 10 or 15 feet before I started the contingency sample.  That's the reason we changed the order."]</i><p>

[This statement is representative of the caution and conservatism that was the hallmark of the Apollo 11 EVA.  Other crews could be less conservative, building on the experiences of others.  However, Neil has been outside for all of eight minutes at this point and is not ready to consider 10 or 15 feet a trivial distance.]</p><p>

[Note that, when Neil said during the Tech Debrief that he "wanted to do it on the right side", he was using "right" and "left" in the sense that those words were used in the cabin, with the crew facing forward.]</p></blockquote><p>
</p><blockquote><i>[On his <a href="a11det38898.jpg" target="new">cuff checklist</a>, Neil's "first pictures" are: 'Photo 3 Gear' and 'Terrain'.

Although there is no explicit mention of Neil taking a panorama at this point, he has evidently decided that a pan will take care of most of 'Terrain' objectives.  Training photo <a href="ap11-S69-32240.jpg" target="new" title="image">S69-32240</a> seems to show Neil practicing this part of the EVA.]</i><p><i>

[Neil  begins by adjusting the f-stop and/or focus on the Hasselblad, then takes up-Sun photo AS11-40-<a href="AS11-40-5850HR.jpg" target="new">5850</a>. He makes his first turn to his right 49 seconds after the start of the clip and then, five seconds
later, sidesteps a little farther from the MESA-mounted TV
camera. Neil's subsequent turns are at 1:08, 1:22, 1:32, 1:36, 1:50, 1:55, 1:59. Because this is Neil's first lunar
panorama, he may be taking his time while he taking the first few
frames. The interval between the first turn/step and the next
turn is 14 seconds.The next two intervals are 14 and 10
seconds. With one exception, subsequent intervals between turns
are 4-5 seconds, perhaps indicating that Neil has gained confidence
that he can turn between frames without trouble. The exception
is the 14-second interval during which Neil took 5855. As indicated on
a <a href="A11MagS-2.jpg" target="new">decal</a> on the top of flown Magazine S, Neil planned to change the f-stop setting from 5.6 to 8 or 11
when taking down-Sun photos. In the video, it appears that, in
preparation for taking 5855,  he increases the setting at about
1:39, takes 5855 at about 1:44, and then goes back to 5.6 after 5855 at
1:45.  Unprocessed

<b>109:34:09</b> Aldrin: Looks like it's a little difficult to dig through the initial crust...<p>

But it appears to be a very cohesive material of the same sort.  I'll try to get a rock in here.  Just a couple.  (Pause)

</p><blockquote><i>[Because the Moon has no atmosphere, the surface is continually bombarded by large and small meteorites - mostly small.  Each impact digs a crater and sprays ejecta around the immediate area.  The net effect is that the very top layer of the soil is very soft.  However, each of the impacts shakes the subsurface layers in the area around the crater, and that shaking tends to settle the subsurface layer and make it denser.  Indeed, as Buzz will discover when he tries to drive a couple of core tubes into the surface at the end of the EVA, below about 4 inches, the soil is very densely packed, rather like beach sand becomes after a wave has withdrawn.]</i><p><i>

</p><blockquote><i>[In response to a question from Mick Winfield in the UK, Journal Contributor Larry Turoski writes, "Living on the west edge of the Mojave Desert, I'll bet he's referring to the area within, say 50 miles or so of Edwards AFB, where he spent a lot of time. The ground elevation around there is about 2500 feet (750 m), give or take. It you go farther north along the eastern Sierra you'll get to elevations of about 4000 feet (1200 m), then with a mighty jump, about 6000 feet (1800 m). Northeast of Edwards, you encounter Death Valley National Park, with elevations ranging from 11,049 feet (3368m) above sea level to 282 feet (86 m) below sea level. South and east of Edwards you get into the "low desert," near and below sea level in some places. The terrain over which he flew the X-15 (a line running northeast/southwest from southern Utah to Edwards( comprises portions of what we call the Basin-and-Range (geologic) province, and the southern portion of the Utah Desert, which is very high and most beautifully weathered canyons in sandstone terrain. The Basin-and-Range contains numerous alternating north-south mountain ridges and north-south valleys, one after the other along an east-west line like teeth on a saw blade. I can say that the desert near Edwards is very Tranquility Base-like, so that was probably what he meant.  Take a look at the website <a href="http://www.caldrive.com" target="new">CalDrive</a>. This site is about driving in California and was written especially for visitors from the UK, Australia, and New Zealand. The author concentrates mostly on the desert and provides numerous photographs of terrain. I recommend it highly. For other pictures of the various desert features to be found in California, including Edwards AFB, I recommend you take a look at <a href="http://www.mojaveroads.com" target="new">Mojave Roads</a>, done by none other than yours truly.

Also, I am looking at one now that appears to have some sort of phenocrysts.<p>

<a href="a11f.1093530.jpg" target="new" title="image">scan</a> from the 16-mm film showing Neil approaching the LM as he removes the handle from the sampler.  Note that he has his visor up.

[Vesicles are spherical imprints of gas bubbles that formed inside the lava as it cools and hardens.  Phenocrysts are embedded crystals.  In his excellent book about the Apollo missions, <a href="http://www.lpi.usra.edu/publications/books/rockyMoon/" target="new">To a Rocky Moon</a>, Don Wilhelms puts both Neil and Buzz in small group of astronauts whom he remembers as having been "either especially interested in geology or competent in science in general" and who, therefore, received special attention from the geology instructors.  Certainly, the ease with which Neil used the terms "vesicle" and "phenocryst" was not the norm.  Later in the EVA, at <a href="a11.clsout.html#1110001" target="new">111:00:01</a>,  he will change his mind about the vesicles and will decide, correctly, that what he is seeing are small craters made in the rocks by small impacts.

[Immediately after Neil said "It's hard for me to bend down further than that", we see him raise his right arm, with the <a href="a11CSSring1.jpg" target="new" title="image">ring clearly in his hand</a>.  He appears to examine the ring - probably having held it aloft to get it into sunlight -  and turning it so that it happens to end up edge-on to the camera.]</p><p>

[In June 2002, Andy Chaikin noted that, two or three frames later, <a href="a11CSSring2.jpg" target="new" title="image">a single frame shows something behind Neil</a> that could be either the ring in flight or a piece of lint or something similar on the film.  Although the center of the object is open, it is not regular in shape and seems more likely to be lint.  In addition, after we see the ring in Neil's hand, his hand motions don't seem to be consistent with a toss back over his shoulder.]</p><p>

[In 2007, Jim Scotti noted that, after Neil lowers his arm and gets his right hand in front of him at about waist height, we see him tossing the ring toward the spacecraft.  Ulli Lotzmann and Ken Glover have created an <a href="samplerring.gif" target="new" title="four-frame animation">animated gif</a> showing Neil flick off the ring toward the spacecraft and capturing it in motion.  The motion is consistent with a <a href="a11det5864CntSmplrRing.jpg" target="new" title="image">detail</a> from AS11-40-<a href="images11.html#5864" target="new">5864</a> showing what is almost certainly the ring lying under the descent stage.]</p><p>

[Two explanations come to mind about Neil's and Buzz's amusement over "throwing things so far".  Later crews had a great deal of fun throwing things in the weak lunar gravity field.  It is possible that Neil and Buzz are amused that their first throw is a short toss under the spacecraft.  Alternatively, things do fall much more slowly on the Moon than they do on Earth and even a casual toss like this one will send the object much farther than would have been the case on Earth.  Although Neil and Buzz may well have had some experience in the cabin tossing things to each other - say a checklist - as short as this first toss was, outside the confines of the cabin the result could have been impressive.   Either interpretation - or both - seem possible.]</p><p>

[In 2012, Journal Contributor AwE130 located the ring in AS11-37-<a href="images11.html#5505" target="new">5505</a>, which is a post-EVA photo Neil took out his window.  AwE130 also noted that, whereas Neil was on the north side of the spacecraft then he tossed the ring, it ended up on the south side.  Knowing the final position of the ring, we can estimate how far Neil threw it  As shown in a <a href="a11CSC_Ring_InFlight_Virtual_LM022.jpg" target="new" title="image">comparison</a> between 5505, the 16-mm frame that immediately follows Neil toss, and a top view of the LM from Scott Sullivan's superb book <i>Virtual LM</i>, we see from the shadows that Neil's hand as about the same distance from the E-W centerline of the LM as the inner ends of the secondary struts.  Similarly, the ring ended up a bit closer to the centerline than the ends of the secondary struts.  Knowing that the outer edges of opposite footpads are 9.45 meters (31 feet) apart, we can estimate that the inner ends of the secondary struts on opposite sides of the spacecraft are 5.52 meters apart and that the ring flew roughly 5.5 meters or, perhaps, a bit less.]</p><p>

[In a gravity field and in the absence of significant atmospheric drag, an object dropped from a height, h, will hit the ground after a time t = sqrt(2xh/g), where g is gravitational acceleration.  On Earth, g = 9.8 m/s<sup>2</sup>; and, on the Moon, g = 1.63 m/s<sup>2</sup>. In the 16-mm film, it appears that Neil releases the ring from about waist height or h = 1.2.  If he had simply dropped the ring, it would have hit the ground after 0.5 seconds.  Or, if he had tossed so that it's initial velocity, v, was purely horizontal, it still would have hit the ground after 0.5 seconds, but would have travelled out a distance d = v x t.]</p><p>

[To get an estimate of the initial horizontal velocity, I performed a simple experiment, tossing an object of similar size to the CSC ring (a shoe polish can) from a height of 1.2 m, using only wrist action and doing my best to get the initial motion purely horizontal.  The can hit the floor d = 2 m out from the point directly below where I released it.  The initial velocity was, then, v = d / t = 2 m / 0.5 s = 4 m/s.]</p><p><i>

[On the Moon, an object dropped or tossed horizontally from a height of 1.2 m would hit the ground after t = sqrt(2xh/g) = sqrt(2x1.2/1.63) = 1.2 seconds.  If tossed with an initial horizontal velocity of 4 m/s, it  would have landed at a distance d = vxt = 4 x 1.2 = 4.8 m. Given the necessary uncertainties in the actual distance the ring flew, the height at which Neil released the ring, and its initial velocity, 4.8 meters is acceptably close to the estimated distance of 5.5 meters.]

<a name="1093911"></a><b>109:39:11</b> Armstrong: Okay.  You saw what difficulties I was having.  I'll try to watch your PLSS from underneath here.

<blockquote><i>[Two means of training for operations in one-sixth g is (1) to work in a water tank with extra weights worn to give you an effective weight of one-sixth g; or (2) to fly in a KC135 aircraft (the transport version of the Boeing 707) as it flies successive parabolas.  On each parabola, you can get about a half minute of one-sixth g.  I asked if they'd had much egress training in either a water tank or in the 135.]</i><p>

[Armstrong - "I don't think so.  The procedure for getting out of the hatch takes longer than the (aircraft) parabola."]</p><p>

[Aldrin - "We probably had some kind of a backpack, pressurized.  You did it in crude training gear, not flight gear, and in one g and concluded that it probably wouldn't be difficult."]</p><p>

[Armstrong - "We didn't do much aircraft <a href="A11CrewTraining.html" target="new">training</a>.  A lot less than we did in <a href="../alsj-GeminiSumConf.html" target="new">Gemini</a>.  I did a lot in Gemini and I suppose you did too."]</p><p>

[Aldrin - "I had a few records with successive parabolas.  I think we did some for Apollo 11.  I think maybe that was the time we...
Yeah, we'd had a little bit of space sickness in some of the flights, like (Frank) Borman (on Apollo 8) and Rusty (Schweickart on Apollo 9, both of whom suffered from zero-g induced disorientation  and nausea), and I don't know whether we had much of a concern or indication from the 10 crew but it was beginning to be a growing concern as to what the room in the Command Module might do."]</p><p>

[None of the Mercury or Gemini flights produced any reports of discomfort or nausea in zero-g, but some of the astronauts on the early Apollo flights suffered dramatically.  One theory was that, in the earlier spacecraft, the astronauts sat in tight quarters for the whole mission and, among other things, had no chance to move their heads very much.  In the Apollo Command Module, you could move about freely and, so, disturb the inner ear.]</p><p>

[Aldrin - "And I felt that shaking the head around during zero-g with a suit over me would test my system to see whether I had any concern.  It probably wasn't very good.  As I mentioned the other night, I don't think moving your head has that much to do with it at all.  Anyway, I rode that trainer more for SAS (Space Adaptation Syndrome).  And I don't remember that we did contingency sampling or anything like that (on the airplane flights)."]</p><p>

[Current thinking is that, rather than being motion related, Space Adaptation Syndrome occurs in some people because they have trouble coordinating the information coming from their inner ears and from their eyes.  After a day or so, almost all people adapt and the queasiness goes away.]</p><p>

[Armstrong - "We did some one-sixth g, but not much.  But we did a little of it, I think, more to test walking and things like that.  I don't remember that we ever did it in suits."]</p><p>

[They also had a training device called the <a href="../apollo.glossary.html#POGO" target="new">POGO</a>, which was a contraption build of cables and booms to give a walking astronaut a sensation of one-sixth g.  I asked if they had done any training with it.]</p><p>

[Aldrin - "Yeah.  But we weren't great believers in that."]</p><p>

[Armstrong - "There was one (POGO) that partially lifted your weight with cables from above, and then there were others where you were suspended at an angle so that you had one-sixth of your weight against a board.  It wasn't very good."]</p><p>

[In a <a href="a11-InclinedPlane5903.jpg" target="new" title="image">schematic drawing</a>, we see Buzz walking toward us along a board inclined 9.6 degrees to the wall of the simulator facility.  One-sixth of his weight is pressing on the board, with the remainder being carried to suspension cables hooked to a carriage mounted on an overhead rail.]</p><p>

[I remarked that they seemed to have no trouble adapting to one-sixth g.]</p><p><i>

[Aldrin - "I think our comments after the flight were that you  didn't need to do one-sixth simulations very much for mobility purposes.  I would think even less for Mars."]</i></p></blockquote>

<b><a name="1094128">109:41:28</a></b> Aldrin: Okay.  Now I want to back up and partially close the hatch.  (Long Pause)  Making sure not to lock it on my way out.<p>
<b>109:41:53</b> Armstrong: (Laughs)  A particularly good thought.

</p><blockquote><i>[The hatch can be opened from the outside, if necessary.  The reason for almost closing the hatch is, I believe, to prevent radiative cooling of the cabin.  Neither Neil or Buzz remembered any specific reason.]</i><p>

[Armstrong (straight-faced) - "To avoid having somebody say 'Were you born in a barn?'"]</p><p>

[Aldrin - "Now that you bring it up, what would have happened if the valve had gotten screwed up or something and it started re-pressurizing?"]</p><p>

[Armstrong - "You'd never get back in."]</p><p>

[Aldrin - "Did we really ever investigate that problem?  (Chuckling)  It probably would have been a good idea to use a brick or a camera to keep it from closing.  Somebody must have thought about that."]</p><p>

[I recalled that the <a href="../DumpValve.html" target="new">dump valve</a> could be opened from the outside.]</p><p>

[Aldrin - "We had a handle (on the outside) to unlatch it.  But, considering the difficulty we had, if you had a couple of psi (in the cabin), you'd never get it open. (Half seriously)  Well, you'd get it open, but you'd never get the bent hatch closed again."]</p><p>

[Actually, the handle is the weak point.]</p><p>

[Aldrin, from the 1969 Technical Debrief - "Once I had my feet and posterior out the hatch, Neil was in good position to help me move out, by just observing the profile of the PLSS and it matched with the hatch opening."]</p><p>

[Armstrong, from the 1969 Technical Debrief - "The two-man operation is good, because all the help that each man can give the other is money in the bank."]</p><p>

[Aldrin, from the 1969 Technical Debrief - "I think the first man moving out (that is, Neil) has a little bit more difficulty because the second man has to be back behind the hatch and has to try to move it out of the way.  So you have the tendency to be more over to your (Neil's) side away from the hatch and anything you are contacting was usually on your side - your edge of the lower part of the DSKY table."]</p><p><i>

[Other crews pointed out that the LMP also had an easier time because his suit pressure was lower.  During cabin depress, the relative suit pressures increase and it takes a while for breath-down - oxygen conversion to carbon dioxide which is scrubbed out by the lithium hydroxide canisters in the PLSSs - to bring the suit pressures down to the operating level of 3.7 to 3.8 psi.  Consequently, the Commanders usually had harder, less flexible suits when they were going out than did the later-emerging LMPs.]</i></p></blockquote>

<b>109:42:18</b> Armstrong: Yes.  I found I could be very comfortable, and walking is also very comfortable.  (Pause)

</p><blockquote><i>[Aldrin, from the 1969 Technical Debrief - "The platform, itself, afforded a more-than-adequate position to transition from going out the hatch to getting on the ladder.  The initial step is a little bit difficult to see. When I got to the first one, I was glad to have you tell me about where my feet were relative to that first step so that I didn't have to make a conscious effort to look around to the side or underneath.  What I am getting at is that the operations on the platform can be carried out without concern about losing your balance and falling off.  There is plenty of area up there to stand on the step and do any manipulating that might be required."]</i></blockquote>

</p><blockquote><i>[Buzz moves back from the ladder and tries a few short jumps up.  In the background, Neil does three fairly high jumps.

[Armstrong, from the 1969 Technical Debrief - "I would say that balance (while walking) was not difficult; however, I did some fairly high jumps and found that there was a tendency to tip over backwards on a high jump.

[Aldrin - "I was probably flexing my knees, but not a whole lot."]</p><p>

[Armstrong, from the 1969 Technical Debrief - "The operation of the suit, in general, was very pleasant.  There was very little hindrance to mobility, with the exception of going down to the surface to pick things up with your hands, which was a very difficult thing to do.  As far as walking around and getting from one place to another, the suit offered very little impediment to that kind of progress.  It was, in general, a pleasant operation."]</p><p>

<blockquote><i>[Aldrin - "I (just now) asked Neil whether the plaque was on the checklist, because I doubt that it was.  'Cause I didn't have one."]</i><p>

[I learned long after the mission review that Buzz is incorrect in remembering that only Neil had a checklist.  They each had a checklist sewn on the left-glove wrist cover.  Buzz's checklist is linked <a href="a11det38937.jpg" target="new">here</a> and Neil's is linked <a href="a11det38898.jpg" target="new">here</a>.  As can be seen in transcriptions of the checklists; there is no mention of the plaque in either <a href="images11.html#neilcuf" target="new">Neil's </a> or <a href="images11.html#buzzcuf" target="new">Buzz's</a>.]</p><p>

[Aldrin - "And it (meaning the plaque) was a fairly late in the training activity.  So was the flag.  I don't recall that I knew how to open the door on the plaque or where the flag really was."]</p><p>

[The 'door' that Buzz mentions is a curved, hinged metal cover.

[Aldrin - "So, if it was a one-man EVA and I was out, I don't know that I would have known how to do that.  The point I may be making is that, when someone says 'How was your training?'  Well, there were a few things that we didn't quite get to in all that training.  But we kept damn busy in all the <a href="A11CrewTraining.html" target="new">training</a> we were doing, but we didn't always cover everything 'cause some things were coming in kind of late in the game."]</p><p>

[According to a 1993 NASA Contractor Report 
'<a href="../alsj-usflag.html" target="new">Where No Flag Has Gone Before</a>' by Anne M. Platoff, the final decision to deploy the plaque and flag was not made until shortly before launch.  However, design of the flag assembly started about three months before launch and training versions were delivered to the Cape on 25 June 1969, late enough that there would have been very few opportunities to practice the deployment in a schedule otherwise dominated by preparations for flight operations.]</p><p>

[Armstrong - "There were changes.  It was evolutionary."]</p><p>

[I asked if the PLSSs were identical.]</p><p>

[Armstrong - "I think they were identical.  The question arises whether our names - our spelled out names - were on the back of the PLSSs.  I didn't think they were.  Some guy said he thought they were."]</p><p><i>

[John Burton, Chris Gainor, and Ulrich Lotzmann all note that Neil was wrong about this.  The name "E.  Aldrin" can be clearly read in good prints of AS11-40-<a href="AS11-40-5942HR.jpg" target="new">5942</a>.  An excellent reproduction can be found in Michael Light's superb book </i>Full Moon<i>.

[Not counting this cosmetic difference, the only functional difference between the PLSSs was in the comm system.  Prior to 1967, NASA had planned to have only one of the LM crewmen go outside on an EVA.  When that decision was changed, it was discovered that it would not be possible to easily re-design the communications system so that both astronauts could transmit simultaneously to the LM.  It was decided, however, that one of the PLSSs could serve as a relay station, picking up voice and data from the non-relay astronaut and then sending the combined voice and data from both astronauts to the LM.  The Commander's PLSS was modified to serve this function.  See <a href="../LMcomm.jpg" target="new" title="image">Figure 2</a> in "Apollo Experience Report: Lunar Module Communications System", NASA document MSC-04031 by R.H. Dietz, D.E. Rhoades, and L.J.

<blockquote><i>[Armstrong - "You probably went from Max back to Intermediate."]</i><p>

[As shown in a <a href="a11det5963.jpg" target="new" title="image">detail</a> from AS11-40-<a href="images11.html#5963" target="new">5963</a>, there is a control lever on the lower right, front corner of Buzz's PLSS that allows him to select the rate at which heat is transferred between the closed-loop <a href="../apollo.glossary.html#LCG" target="new">LCG</a> water supply and the sublimator feedwater.  There are three detents which allow him to select Minimum cooling, Intermediate, or Maximum, although settings between the detents would also work.]</p><p>

[Armstrong, from the 1969 Technical Debrief - "Thermal loads in the suit were not bad at all;  I ran on minimum flow almost the entire time.  Buzz found a higher flow to be desirable.  This was consistent with our individual pre-flight experience.  I didn't notice any temperature thermal differences in and out of the (LM) shadow.  There were slight light differences and visibility changes, but no thermal differences.  The only temperature problem I had  - and Buzz didn't have this problem - was with the gloves.  I did not wear inner gloves.  I chose to go without the inner liners in the gloves (which would have provided some relief from abrasion, at a cost of reduced dexterity), and my hands were a little warm and very wet all the time.  They got very damp and clammy inside the gloves.  I found that this problem degraded my ability to handle objects and to get firm grips on things."]</p><p>

[Dampness in the gloves, together with abrasion from the inner surface of the glove and from the wrist ring, was a recurring problem for the Apollo crews.  The <a href="../apollo.glossary.html#LCG" target="new">LCG</a> did not extend past the wrists and, so, provided no cooling to the hands.  In addition, the necessarily tight fit of the gloves prevented any airflow onto the hands and, therefore, meant that there was no way to keep them dry.]</p><p>

[Aldrin, from the 1969 Technical Debrief - "I had cooler levels set on the (feedwater) diverter valve, because it just seemed to be comfortably pleasant that way.  In retrospect, it appears that this leads toward a higher consumption of water.  I wasn't fully aware that, when you are on a higher flow, you are going to be pumping more water overboard.  It was not clear to me pre-flight that it did have that effect on your water consumption.  I certainly could have operated at lower levels much sooner without overheating."]</p><p>

[NASA planners had expected Neil to use 5.4 pounds of cooling water during the EVA and Buzz 5.1 pounds.  In reality, Neil used a mere 2.9 pounds, while Buzz used 4.4.  That is, while both of them used significantly less water than had been expected, Buzz's preference for Intermediate cooling showed an even more noticeable effect.]</p><p>

[Aldrin, from the 1969 Technical Debrief - "In confirmation of Neil's findings, I didn't experience any hot or even warm spots in the suit.  I didn't wear any inner glove, either, in my desire to get a better feel through the gloves.  During the <a href="../alsj-A7LDonDoff.html" target="new">donning</a>, I did not have the wristlets on.  (The wristlets were designed to provide protection against abrasion by the wrist rings that connect the gloves to the suit.) I thought that the LCG extending down far enough into the wrist would be adequate.  If I had to repeat this effort, I would put the wristlets on, because once I was in the gloves and I started moving them around, I did find that it was rubbing a small amount on the wrist.  I thought that it might get to be more annoying than it actually turned out to be; but, looking back, I would have preferred having those wristlets on."]</p><p><i>

Neil's time is too valuable to spend much time on any one view.  On the Rover missions, the <a href="../GCTA-Final-Report.pdf" target="new">TV camera</a> was operated from Houston and there was more freedom for the Backroom to take hard looks at particular objects with the TV - subject to the needs of others in Mission Control to watch what the astronauts were doing.
Generally, the TV was more suited for watching the astronauts than for looking at geologic features.  Photographs gave far better resolution than was possible with the TV and, so, were of more long-term value to the geologists.  Although the geologists used the TV in real-time EVA planning, generally, it was more valuable as a means for Houston to get a feel for the conditions under which the astronauts were working and, occasionally, gave Houston a chance to let the crew know that they had dropped something or that a piece of equipment was being used improperly.]</i><p><i>

It wasn't quite as stable as I would have liked it to have been, but it was adequate to hold it in a vertical position...Once you go past a depth of 4 or 5 inches, the ground gets quite hard.  However, I didn't get much of a cue to this at this point while installing the solar wind experiment."]</i></blockquote>
<b>110:04:05</b> Aldrin: Some of these small depressions (garbled) soft and you tend to sink, oh, maybe 2 or 3 inches.  (Garbled) suggest exactly what the Surveyor pictures showed when they pushed away a little bit.  You get a force transmitted through the upper surface of the soil and about 5 or 6 inches of bay (meaning a crescent-shaped patch) breaks loose and moves as if it were caked on the surface when, in fact, it really isn't.

<blockquote><i>[Aldrin - "The way that the soil is in front, it moves with the boot.  Five or six inches seems like an awful long distance to me right now."]</i><p>

[Armstrong - "What do you think you were saying that got transcribed as 'bay'?  It sort of sounds like 'bay' but I'm sure that's not what it is."]</p><p>

[Aldrin - "What I think I'm trying to get across (at the beginning of the statement) is, in these small depressions, that you sink in on the edges of them two or three inches; whereas before you get to them - or in the center - it's back to a quarter of an inch, maybe.  In other words, a loose consistency is where there's a change in slope."]</p><p>

[Buzz's other observation, confirming what experimenters saw when they commanded the various Surveyor spacecraft to push their mechanical scoops forward through the soil, is that, out in front of the scoop or boot, a section of soil tends to move as one.  And, at the front edge of this co-moving section, there is a sharp line of demarcation.  Journal Contributor Thomas Schwagmeier notes that, at the right temperature, snow behaves in a similar fashion.]</p><p>

[Next, Neil and Buzz will deploy the U.S. Flag.  The flag deployment is not listed in either checklist.  A detail discussion of the flag assembly and the decision to deploy it can be found in Anne Platoff's </a><a href="../alsj-usflag.html" target="new">Where No Flag Has Gone Before</a>'.  The flag is stowed in a thermal shroud under the lefthand ladder rail as shown in NASA photo <a href="../mccraw.gif" target="new" title="image">S69-38755</a>.  See, also, Neil's photo of Buzz on the bottom ladder rung, AS11-40-<a href="images11.html#5868" target="new">5868</a>.]</p><p><i>

[At about 110:05:20, about 2 min 27 secs into the 16-mm clip, what may be the flag shroud  can be seen in three successive screen grabs from the spacecraft Films version of the clip.  The shroud is about a meter long and is the top item in Figure 5 in Platoff's <a href="../alsj-usflag.html" target="new">paper</a>. The three screen grabs have been combined in a <a href="Apollo11DACframesFlagShroud.pdf" target="new">pdf document</a> along with screen grabs immediately before and after the three of interest.   Screen Grab  1 shows the scene a moment after Neil and Buzz entered the LM shadow at the lower left to get the flag off the left rail of the ladder. Note that the camera mounted over Buzz's window gives a view to the northwest.  Shadows extend diagonally up and to the left (west) from the objects casting them. Screen Grab  2 shows a dark streak that extends from center left diagonally up and to the right, and ends just above a foot-sized rock.  A second streak is below and to the right and has a kink just before its upper-right end.  Although it gives the appearance of a shadow of the more prominent streak, if the prominent streak were a physical object casting a shadow on the ground, the shadow would be above and to the left, rather than below and to the right.  Sreen Grab 2 also included a short streak above and the the left of the prominent streak.  Screen Grab 3 includes ghosts of the three streaks from the Screen Grab 2. These may be the result of processing done to produce the video version of the 1 frame-per-second 16mm film.  There is, however, a new streak similar in length and orientation to the prominent streak in Screen Grab 2, but starting just beyond its upper-right end.  Screen Grab 4 shows the "new" streak on it's own and a bit darker.  Although it is tempting to believe that the prominent streak and the "new" streak represent the flag shroud in flight, it seems more likely that we are seeing either scanning artifacts or something that was briefly on the film while it was being exposed. Thanks to Paolo Attivissimo for calling attention to these frames, for providing the screen grabs, and for most of the observations reported here.]</i></p></blockquote>

[Journal Contributors Owen Merrick, Brian McInall, and Markus Mehring call attention to the fact that, as shown in a high-resolution version <a href="a11det5875BuzzFace.jpg" target="new" title="image">detail</a> by Thomas Schwagmeier from AS11-40-<a href="AS11-40-5875HR.jpg" target="new">5875</a>, we can see 
Buzz peering over at Neil.  In 
<a href="AS11-40-5874HR.jpg" target="new">5874</a> Buzz is facing the flag and saluting; but, by the time Neil takes 5875, Buzz has turned slightly to look over to see if Neil has taken the picture, possibly having lowered his right hand in the interim.  Normally, the high reflectivity of the gold visor would keep us from seeing Buzz's face but, as Mehring notes, in this case "his face is directly illuminated by the sunlight from the front and at a right angle to the observer's point of view, so it literally shines through the visor, especially because he's sticking his head forward. At different viewing and illumination angles and with his head deeper inside the helmet and less brightly illuminated, reflections off of the visor that would wash out anything behind it.  But in this case we're lucky."  Journal Contributor Harald Kucharek has created an
<a href="as11-40-5874-75.gif" target="new" title="image">animated gif image</a> consisting of frames 5874 and 5875 which clearly shows Buzz turning his torso slightly between frames, but without moving his feet.  Note, in particular, the change in his knee positions.  The TV record of this interval shows Buzz turning in Neil's direction twice during this interval.]</p><p>

[Armstrong (<a href="a11PostFlightPressConf.html" target="new">Post mission press conference</a>) - "We had some difficulty, at first, getting the pole of the flag to remain in the surface.  In penetrating the surface, we found that most objects would go down about 5, maybe 6, inches and then it would meet with a gradual resistance.  At the same time, there was not much of a support force on either side, so we had to lean the flag back slightly in order for it to maintain this position."]</p><p>

[Later crews hammered the staff into the ground.]</p><p>

[According to Platoff's <a href="../alsj-usflag.html" target="new">history of the Apollo 11 flag</a>,   "The base of the lower section was designed with a hardened steel point to make it easier to drive into the lunar soil."  As Buzz will discover when he tries to hammer two core tubes into the surface at about <a href="a11.clsout.html#1111513" target="new">111:15:13</a>, the regolith is very tightly compacted below a few inches and, apparently, Neil is unable to put enough force on the tip of the staff to allow it to penetrate any appreciable distance.  During the Apollo 12 flag deployment at about <a href="../a12/a12.tvtrbls.html#1161412" target="new">116:14:12</a>, Al Bean will hammer the bottom section (with its top suitably hardened) about a foot into the ground without encountering any increase in resistance with depth.]</p><p>

[Armstrong, from the 1969 Technical Debrief - "The flagstaff was pushed into the ground at a slight angle such that the c.g. (center of gravity) of the overall unit would tend to be somewhat above the point at which the flagstaff was inserted in the lunar surface.  (That is, they tilted the flag so that it would balance.)  That seemed to hold alright, but I noted later, after getting back into the LM, that the weight of the flag had rotated the entire unit about the flagpole axis such that the flag was no longer pointed in the same direction as it was originally.  I suspect that the weight of the flagpole probably had shifted its position in the sand a little bit from the position where it had originally been installed."]</p><p>

[The last flag images we have from before the rest period are Hasselblad images - such as <a href="AS11-37-5465HR.jpg" target="new">AS11-37-5465</a> - they took out the windows at <a href="a11.posteva.html#1122056" target="new">112:20:56</a> and Super-8 film showing the TV monitor at Honeysuckle Creek not long after <a href="a11.posteva.html#11411xx" target="new"> 114:10:37</a> during the PLSS jettison.  Both show the flag in its deployed configuration.  The next flag images we have are from a DAC pan Buzz took not long after <a href="a11.launch.html#1234832" target="new">123:48:32</a>.  It is clear that the shift in flag orientation Neil noticed occured sometime after the PLSS jettison.  Because Buzz took the DAC pan about an hour after the RCS hot-fire check at <a href="a11.launch.html#1234832" target="new">123:48:32</a>, we have no way of knowing what configuration the flag was in after the shift Neil noticed.]</p><p>
