Einstein placed five matches on the table and asked, 'What is the total length of these five matches if each is two and a half inches long?' 'Twelve and a half inches,' Ferriere replied.

<li>It's a rather close paraphrase of the following from his Autobiographical Notes: "It is, in fact, nothing short of a miracle that the modern methods of instruction have not yet entirely strangled the holy curiosity of inquiry; for this delicate little plant, aside from stimulation, stands mainly in need of freedom; without this it goes to wreck and ruin without fail.

<ul><li>No amount of experimentation can ever prove me right; a single experiment can prove me wrong.
<ul><li>A bunch of pre-1950 sources for this but they all say this is something he is "reported to have said" without giving an exact source.

<li>In <i>The New Quotable Einstein</i> Alice Calaprice speculates on p. 291 that 'This may be a paraphrase of sentiments expressed in "Induction and Deduction," December 25, 1919, CPAE, Vol. 7, Doc. 28'. <i>Einstein's Unification</i> by Jeroen van Dongen has a quote from the article (full English title given as "Induction and Deduction in Physics") on <a class="external text" href="http://books.google.com/books?id=T8Fde0u_XyIC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA44#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" rel="nofollow">p. 44</a>: 'A theory can thus be recognized as erroneous if there is a logical error in its deductions, or as inadequate if a fact is not in agreement with its consequences. But the <i>truth</i> of a theory can never be proven. For one never knows that even in the future no experience will be encountered which contradicts its consequences; and still other systems of thought are always conceivable which are capable of joining together the same given facts.' Also, <a class="external text" href="http://books.google.com/books?id=T5R7JsRRtoIC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA18#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" rel="nofollow">p. 18</a> of <i>Albert Einstein, the Human Side</i> has a note he wrote down on 11 Nov 1922 which expresses a basically similar idea: 'The scientific theorist is not to be envied. For Nature, or more precisely experiment, is an inexorable and not very friendly judge of his work. It never says "Yes" to a theory. In the most favorable cases it says "Maybe," and in the great majority of cases simply "No." If an experiment agrees with a theory it means for the latter "Maybe," and if it does not agree it means "No." Probably every theory will someday experience its "No"—most theories, soon after conception.' <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/User:Hypnosifl" title="User:Hypnosifl">Hypnosifl</a> 21:50, 2 December 2011 (UTC)</li></ul></li></ul>

Besides agreeing with the aims of vegetarianism for aesthetic and moral reasons, it is my view that a vegetarian manner of living by its purely physical effect on the human temperament would most beneficially influence the lot of mankind."

It also appears without quotation marks on <a class="external text" href="http://books.google.com/books?id=_7ZAAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22same+level+of+thinking%22#search_anchor" rel="nofollow">p. 54</a> of <i>The Quest, Vol. 1-2</i> (1988) from the Theosophical Society. (edit: I thought at first <i>The Quest</i> could be the original source of the quote since it gives a paraphrase rather than claiming to be a direct quote, but see below...) <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/User:Hypnosifl" title="User:Hypnosifl">Hypnosifl</a> 15:40, 7 December 2011 (UTC)</li>
<li>I missed an even earlier "same level of thinking" example from 1985: <i>The 1985 Annual: Developing Human Resources, Issue 14</i> by Leonard D. Goodstein and J. William Pfeiffer, <a class="external text" href="http://books.google.com/books?id=rkC3AAAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22same+level+of+thinking%22#search_anchor" rel="nofollow">p. 185</a>: "Our thinking has created problems which cannot be solved by that same level of thinking." <i>The Quest</i> might still be the source of "the world we have made" part that appears in some of these quotes, though. <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/User:Hypnosifl" title="User:Hypnosifl">Hypnosifl</a> 16:17, 7 December 2011 (UTC)</li>
<li>Looks like the article in <i>The Quest</i> is "Believing Is Seeing, Not the Reverse" by "educator Edward T. Clark, Jr." mentioned on <a class="external text" href="http://books.google.com/books?id=_7ZAAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22believing+is+seeing%22#search_anchor" rel="nofollow">p. 4</a>, which begins on p. 49 and <a class="external text" href="http://books.google.com/books?id=_7ZAAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22edward+t.+clark%22#search_anchor" rel="nofollow">ends on p. 56</a> (the Einstein quote is p. 54). From the byline at the end, this article is from 1988, so it probably doesn't predate the quote in <i>Take this job and love it</i> since <a class="external text" href="http://www.amazon.com/Take-This-Job-Love-Changing/dp/0671638548" rel="nofollow">according to amazon</a> that book was published in March 1988, and the quote given there is said to be the motto of an already-existing organization, "The Organizational Management and Leadership Program at John F. Kennedy University in Orinda, California." <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/User:Hypnosifl" title="User:Hypnosifl">Hypnosifl</a> 16:43, 7 December 2011 (UTC)</li>
<li>Ah, searching for "Einstein" and "level of thinking" rather than "same level of thinking" turns up a much earlier example from <i>The Journal of Transpersonal Psychology, Volumes 1-4</i>, which is dated 1969 by google books though <a class="external text" href="http://books.google.com/books?id=Hr4tAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=copyright#search_anchor" rel="nofollow">these snippets</a> show it contains pieces from 1969 and 1970. The quote, on <a class="external text" href="http://books.google.com/books?id=Hr4tAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22level+of+thinking%22#search_anchor" rel="nofollow">p. 124</a>, is "The world that we have made as a result of the level of thinking we have done thus far creates problems that we cannot solve at the same level as the level we created them at." It's prefaced by "Einstein said an interesting thing", and the same phrase and quote appears in a 1974 book by <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ram_Dass" title="w:Ram Dass">Ram Dass</a> (who needs his own wikiquote page!), <i>The Only Dance There Is</i>, on <a class="external text" href="http://books.google.com/books?id=Ske6kzQlmKcC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PT50#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" rel="nofollow">this page</a>, so presumably the one in <i>The Journal of Transpersonal Psychology</i> is the same piece by Ram Dass. Ram Dass may also be the source of another misquote, the one at <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Talk:Albert_Einstein#Quote_Misattribution.3F" title="Talk:Albert Einstein">Talk:Albert_Einstein#Quote_Misattribution.3F</a>--whatta rascal! <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/User:Hypnosifl" title="User:Hypnosifl">Hypnosifl</a> 17:09, 7 December 2011 (UTC)
<ul><li>Also, the next two earliest versions I find on google books (searching for "Einstein" and "level of thinking" on an <a class="external text" href="http://books.google.com/advanced_book_search?q=%22level+of+thinking%22+einstein" rel="nofollow">advanced search</a> with date range 1900-1979) use wording nearly identical to the version given by <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Ram_Dass" title="Ram Dass">Ram Dass</a> (who now does have a wikiquote page): <a class="external text" href="http://books.google.com/books?id=LP0tAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=einstein+%22level+of+thinking%22#search_anchor" rel="nofollow">Skeptic 1-10, p. 55</a> (1974), which from <a class="external text" href="http://books.google.com/books?id=gD0gAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22A+Radical+Restructuring+An+Interview+with+David+Dellinger%22#search_anchor" rel="nofollow">this snippet</a> is from the article "A Radical Restructuring: An Interview with <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Dellinger" title="w:David Dellinger">David Dellinger</a>", and <a class="external text" href="http://books.google.com/books?id=gUU7AQAAIAAJ&amp;q=einstein+%22level+of+thinking%22#search_anchor" rel="nofollow">New Age, Volume 5, p. 42</a> (1979), with the rest of the quote in <a class="external text" href="http://books.google.com/books?id=gUU7AQAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22problems+that+we+cannot%22#search_anchor" rel="nofollow">this snippet</a>...here "New Age" appears to be the same magazine as the <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Age_Journal" title="w:New Age Journal">New Age Journal</a> founded by Peggy Taylor, whose name appears in <a class="external text" href="http://books.google.com/books?id=gUU7AQAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22peggy+taylor%22#search_anchor" rel="nofollow">this snippet</a>, a snippet that also mentions "Faith, Science, and the Future by David Harris" which seems to start on <a class="external text" href="http://books.google.com/books?id=gUU7AQAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22Faith%2C+science+and+the+future%22#search_anchor" rel="nofollow">p. 41</a> of the google books edition, so that's probably the article the Einstein quote on p. 42 comes from (the snippet with Peggy Taylor also lists "Faith, Science, and the Future" as appearing in the October 1979 issue). The supposed Einstein quote from Skeptic reads "the world we have made as a result of the level of thinking we have done thus far creates problems that we cannot solve at the level of thinking at which we created them", and the one from New Age reads "the world that we have made, as a result of the level of thinking we have done thus far, creates problems that we cannot solve at the same level we created them", both identical to Ram Dass' quote in the first part and very close in the second part. Since Ram Dass generally spoke extemporaneously without using notes, and <i>The Only Dance There Is</i> says the section with the Einstein quote is from talks he gave to "spiritual seekers" at "the Menninger Foundation in 1970", it's likely he would have been paraphrasing a bit even if his source was some other unknown one that also misquoted Einstein (as opposed to him being the original source of the misquote as I am speculating). So if the only other sources found in the 1970s repeat Ram Dass' exact wording, it seems pretty likely that Ram Dass (or some secondary source that got the quote from Ram Dass) was the source for them. And the later variants that emerged in the 1980s and 1990s might well be all from authors that got their quotes in a chain of influences that goes back to Ram Dass' version. <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/User:Hypnosifl" title="User:Hypnosifl">Hypnosifl</a> (<a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/User_talk:Hypnosifl" title="User talk:Hypnosifl">talk</a>) 15:34, 20 July 2012 (UTC)</li>
<li>And expanding the date range of the search to 1900-1985, the next earliest version of the quote after the ones above is again almost identical in wording to Ram Dass' version (aside from replacing "cannot" with "can't"): <a class="external text" href="http://books.google.com/books?id=6GNHAAAAMAAJ" rel="nofollow">Community mental health and behavioral-ecology (1982)</a>. Google is a bit glitchy so no result is found when I go to the book's page and search "Einstein" or "level of thinking", but the book appears on p. 2 of all the search results for those words with date range 1900-1985, alongside the snippet: "... AND KNOWLEDGE BASES The world we have made as a result of the level of thinking we have done thus far creates problems that we can 't solve at the same level as the level we created them at. (Albert Einstein; cited by Ulrich." Then after this book, the next-earliest that is verified to have the words "einstein" and "level of thinking" by google books is <a class="external text" href="http://books.google.com/books?id=rkC3AAAAIAAJ&amp;q=einstein+%22level+of+thinking%22#search_anchor" rel="nofollow">The 1985 Annual: Developing Human Resources, Issue 14, p. 185</a> (1985).

<ul><li>Found the above <i>Community mental health and behavior-ecology</i>, the quote appears on p. 1: <i>The world we have made as a result of the level of thinking we have done thus far creates problems that we can't solve at the same level as the level we created them at. (Albert Einstin; cited by Ulrich, 1980, p. 2.)</i> And the "Ulrich" reference is: <i>Ulrich, R. E.

<li>Searching for the phrase "solve at the same level we created them" turns up a few other sources that for some reason didn't turn up when I searched "level of thinking" and "einstein" (google book searches seem to be very glitchy): The 1975 book <i>More power than we know: the people's movement toward democracy</i> by David Dellinger, <a class="external text" href="http://books.google.com/books?id=Ys4DAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22solve+at+the+same+level+we+created+them%22#search_anchor" rel="nofollow">p. 291</a> ("The world that we have made as a result of the level of thinking we have done thus far creates problems that we cannot solve at the same level we created them at"); 1982's <i>Perspectives</i>, Volume 14, Issue 3 from the United States Commission on Civil Rights, <a class="external text" href="http://books.google.com/books?id=zsgyOzvb6FUC&amp;q=%22solve+at+the+same+level+we+created+them%22#search_anchor" rel="nofollow">p. 26</a> (same version as Dellinger book); and The 1982 book <i>Nuclear Power, Both Sides: The Best Arguments for and Against the Most Controversial Technology</i> by Michio Kaku and Jennifer Trainer, <a class="external text" href="http://books.google.com/books?id=7A9A9BSk0eUC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA238#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" rel="nofollow">p. 238</a> (nearly the same as the Dellinger book, but with "The world we have made" in place of "The world <i>that</i> we have made"). <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/User:Hypnosifl" title="User:Hypnosifl">Hypnosifl</a> (<a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/User_talk:Hypnosifl" title="User talk:Hypnosifl">talk</a>) 00:36, 22 July 2012 (UTC)</li>
<li>I also seem to get different results when I use Safari than when I use Firefox. Searching for "level of thinking" and "Einstein" on Safari, and sorting the results by date and looking at the earliest, I also see the 1979 volume <i>Behaviorists for Social Action journal</i>, Volumes 2-3, <a class="external text" href="http://books.google.com/books?id=xYAXAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22level+of+thinking%22+einstein#search_anchor" rel="nofollow">p. 2</a> (the quote here is "The world we have made as a result of the level of thinking we have done thus far creates problems that we can't solve at the same level as the level we created them at"), and searching for "world that we have made" and "einstein" gives the various pre-1985 sources: the1980 book <i>Beat the system!: A way to create more human environments</i>, <a class="external text" href="http://books.google.com/books?id=_I62AAAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22world+that+we+have+made%22+einstein#search_anchor" rel="nofollow">p. 1</a> ("The world that we have have made as a result of the level of thinking that we have done thus far creates problems that we cannot solve at the same level at which we created them"), the 1983 book <i>The Optimum utilization of knowledge: making knowledge serve human betterment</i>, <a class="external text" href="http://books.google.com/books?id=N7qOAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22world+that+we+have+made%22+einstein#search_anchor" rel="nofollow">p. 295</a> ("The world that we have made as a result of thinking we have done thus far creates problems that we cannot solve at the level we created them at"), and <i>1984 National Science Foundation Authorization: Hearings Before the Subcommittee on Science, Research, and Technology of the Committee on Science and Technology, U.S. House of Representatives, Ninety-eighth Congress, First Session, on H.R. 2066, February 23, 25; March 1, 8, 10, 1983</i>, <a class="external text" href="http://books.google.com/books?id=sV0VAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22world+that+we+have+made%22#search_anchor" rel="nofollow">p. 240</a> ("The world that we have made as a result of the level of thinking we have done thus far creates problems that we cannot solve at the same level as the level we created them at"). Again, all of these pre-1985 quotes seem to be very close to Ram Dass' version from 1970, "The world that we have made as a result of the level of thinking we have done thus far creates problems that we cannot solve at the same level as the level we created them at." <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/User:Hypnosifl" title="User:Hypnosifl">Hypnosifl</a> (<a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/User_talk:Hypnosifl" title="User talk:Hypnosifl">talk</a>) 03:54, 22 July 2012 (UTC)</li></ul></li>

Seems unlikely to me, they probably just have a single computer record of the date of a given post, so the fact that the same date appears under "more options" wouldn't qualify as independent confirmation of the date. Still, I do think the date is most likely correct despite the gap in time between this post and later ones with the same quote, there could well be other posts in between that just didn't show up in the search (I've noticed that searches of google groups are often unreliable, often I'll search for posts with a given set of keywords, then do another search with slightly different but similar keywords, and come across posts that <i>should</i> have showed up in the first search but didn't). <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/User:Hypnosifl" title="User:Hypnosifl">Hypnosifl</a> (<a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/User_talk:Hypnosifl" title="User talk:Hypnosifl">talk</a>) 16:08, 16 April 2012 (UTC)</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul>

In <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein#1940s" title="Albert Einstein">Albert_Einstein#1940s</a> there's a discussion of the quote "A new type of thinking is essential if mankind is to survive and move toward higher levels", which mentions that Alice Calaprice speculated that some similar unsourced quotes about the need to change our "thinking" to better the world may be misquotes of that one. <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/User:Hypnosifl" title="User:Hypnosifl">Hypnosifl</a> 22:03, 3 December 2011 (UTC)</li>
<li>Searching instead for "einstein" and "world we have created", the two earliest I find are from 1992, one is <i>Changing course: a global business perspective on development and the environment</i> by Stephan Schmidheiny, which on <a class="external text" href="http://books.google.com/books?id=BDYGdfiAGtoC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA82#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" rel="nofollow">p. 82</a> has the totally convoluted-sounding "The world we have created today as a result of our thinking thus far has problems which cannot be solved by thinking the way we thought when we created them" (the edition on google books is the fifth printing from 1998, so it's possible the 1992 edition might not have had the quote), and the other is <i>Forbes, Vol 150, Issues 6-10</i> which on <a class="external text" href="http://books.google.com/books?id=rRm8AAAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22The+world+we+have+created+today+has+problems+that+cannot+be+solved+by+thinking+the+way+we+thought+when+we+created+them%22#search_anchor" rel="nofollow">p. 177</a> has the slightly less convoluted "The world we have created today has problems that cannot be solved by thinking the way we thought when we created them." Quotes with "the world we have made" probably predate ones with "world we have created", since the phrase "world we have made" appears in the 1969 or 1970 article by Ram Dass, mentioned above in the discussion of a variant of the quote "Problems cannot be solved by the level of awareness that created them", and the Ram Dass article also contains the phrase "thus far" which appears in both quotes above. <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/User:Hypnosifl" title="User:Hypnosifl">Hypnosifl</a> 15:57, 7 December 2011 (UTC)</li></ul></li></ul>

<ul><li>Computers are incredibly fast, accurate and stupid. Human beings are incredibly slow, inaccurate and brilliant. Together they are powerful beyond imagination.
<ul><li>Seems to be a variant of a quote (not by Einstein) from the 1969 <i>Advances in Instrumentation: Vol 24, Part 4</i> which says on <a class="external text" href="http://books.google.com/books?id=A-YpAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22Computers+are+incredibly+fast%2C+accurate+and+stupid%22#search_anchor" rel="nofollow">p. 16</a>: "Computers are incredibly fast, accurate and stupid.

<li>Also, it looks like this is from the article "A Paper Industry Application of Systems Engineering and Direct Digital Control" by H. D. Couture, Jr. and M. A. Keyes which starts on <a class="external text" href="http://books.google.com/books?id=A-YpAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22and+direct+digital+control%22#search_anchor" rel="nofollow">p. 13</a>...you can see from the snippet of p. 13 that H.D.

I see that a comment from "stevestart" on <a class="external text" href="http://www.benshoemate.com/2008/11/30/einstein-never-said-that/" rel="nofollow">this page</a> confirms the quote is from that article, but a comment by "Toddulus" mentions a variant of the quote was written by Robert O' Conner in April 1968 (see <a class="external text" href="http://journals.lww.com/joem/Citation/1968/04000/Fast,_Accurate_and_Stupid.10.aspx" rel="nofollow">here</a>), and a comment by "David" gives a reference saying it was spoken by Leo Cherne in a speech from June 1968.

<li>And even earlier is <i>Current</i> from 1962, which says on <a class="external text" href="http://books.google.com/books?id=TwwQAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22Man+is+a+slow%2C+sloppy%2C+and+brilliant+thinker%3B+computers+are+fast%2C+accurate%2C+and+stupid%22#search_anchor" rel="nofollow">p. 53</a>: "Man is a slow, sloppy, and brilliant thinker; computers are fast, accurate and stupid." It seems from the snippet that this source is just quoting an earlier article, "Problems, Too, Have Problems" which appeared in the October 1961 issue of <i>Fortune</i> magazine. As mentioned on <a class="external text" href="http://books.google.com/books?id=t_oKAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22problems%2C+too%2C+have+problems%22#search_anchor" rel="nofollow">p. 101</a> of <i>ASPO newsletter, Volumes 25-27</i>, the "Problems, Too, Have Problems" article was written by John Pfeiffer, and two other early sources credit Pfeiffer with the observation that computers are fast, accurate, and stupid, see <a class="external text" href="http://books.google.com/books?id=teYVAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=fast+accurate+stupid+pfeiffer#search_anchor" rel="nofollow">p. 85</a> of <i>Elementary English, Volume 39</i> (1962), and <i>The Journal of medical education, Volume 37, Issue 2</i> (1962) on p. 72 (see <a class="external text" href="http://books.google.com/books?id=mjR0AAAAIAAJ&amp;q=pfeiffer#search_anchor" rel="nofollow">this snippet</a> and <a class="external text" href="http://books.google.com/books?id=mjR0AAAAIAAJ&amp;q=fast+accurate+stupid#search_anchor" rel="nofollow">this one</a>.)

<ul><li>No, this trick won't work... How on earth are you ever going to explain in terms of chemistry and physics so important a biological phenomenon as first love?
<ul><li>Earliest published version I found was <i>Symposium on structure of enzymes and proteins</i> from 1956, which says on <a class="external text" href="http://books.google.com/books?id=H4QjXb4gnEIC&amp;q=%22so+important+a+biological%22#search_anchor" rel="nofollow">p. 284</a> and <a class="external text" href="http://books.google.com/books?id=H4QjXb4gnEIC&amp;q=%22morgan+what+he+was+doing%22#search_anchor" rel="nofollow">p. 283</a>: 'I asked Dr. Morgan what he was doing in genetics then and he said, "I am not doing any genetics. I am bored with genetics. But I am going out to Cal Tech where I hope it will be possible to bring physics and chemistry to bear on biology. I think it will be good for biologists to live in that atmosphere." At that time a protein molecule was not a big black ball. It was something very smeary but equally dark. And de- naturation was a very mysterious phenomenon. Enzymes were almost as mysterious as they were at the time of the Pasteur-Liebig controversy. We could measure pTL and a few things like that and that was about all. There was some resentment, I think, among some biologists that their students, the younger people, were even using pH meters. In fact, a lot of fun was made about the dominance of pH over biology. Shortly after Dr. Morgan came to Cal Tech (and I came a year after he did), Einstein was visiting our place. He came around to biology, and talking to Dr. Morgan asked him what he was trying to do there, said it was a strange thing for a biologist to be at an Institute of Technology. Dr. Morgan told him what he had told me. Einstein shook his head and said, <b>"No, this trick won't work. The same trick does not work twice. How on earth are you ever going to explain in terms of chemistry and physics so important a biological phenomenon as first love?"'</b> All this is apparently from a piece that begins on p. 283 by Henry Borsook, and is titled 'Informal remarks "by way of a summary"', as seen in the table of contents <a class="external text" href="http://books.google.com/books?id=H4QjXb4gnEIC&amp;q=283#search_anchor" rel="nofollow">here</a>, and searching inside for "Henry Borsook" shows that his name does appear at the top of <a class="external text" href="http://books.google.com/books?id=H4QjXb4gnEIC&amp;q=%22henry+borsook%22#search_anchor" rel="nofollow">p. 283</a>.

<li>Doing a <a class="external text" href="http://books.google.com/advanced_book_search?q=%22sacred+gift%22+einstein" rel="nofollow">google book search</a> and restricting the date range to 1900-1990, there are only 10 books and several of them attribute it to "Samples, 1976" which is apparently <a class="external text" href="http://books.google.com/books?id=z2F9AAAAMAAJ" rel="nofollow"><i>The Metaphoric Mind</i> by Bob Samples</a> (which also seems to be the earliest published variant).

<li>Einstein had many quotes about the value of intuition and imagination, but the specific word "gift" can be found in a comment remembered by János Plesch in the section <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein#Posthumous_publications" title="Albert Einstein">Albert_Einstein#Posthumous_publications</a>, "When I examine myself and my methods of thought I come to the conclusion that the gift of fantasy has meant more to me than my talent for absorbing positive knowledge." So, Bob Samples might have been paraphrasing that comment. Likewise Einstein had a number of quotes about the intellect being secondary to intuition, but the language of the intellect "serving" can be found in a quote from <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein#Out_of_My_Later_Years_.281950.29" title="Albert Einstein">Albert_Einstein#Out_of_My_Later_Years_.281950.29</a>, "And certainly we should take care not to make the intellect our god; it has, of course, powerful muscles, but no personality.

There comes a leap in consciousness, call it intuition or what you will, and the solution comes to you and you do not know how or why.

<li>Earliest references on google books seem to be two 1969 books by <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fritz_Perls" title="w:Fritz Perls">Frederick S. Perls</a>, the founder of gestalt therapy. In one, <i>Gestalt Therapy Verbatim</i>, he claims to have heard it from Einstein, writing 'As Albert Einstein once said to me: "Two things are infinite: the universe and the human stupidity."' In another book, "Ego, Hunger, and Aggression: the Beginning of Gestalt Therapy" he attributes it to "a great astronomer" and then refers to Einstein separately in the next sentence: 'it is not surprising to learn that a great astronomer said: "Two things are infinite, as far as we know — the universe and human stupidity." To-day we know that this statement is not quite correct. Einstein has proved that the universe is limited.' So it's not clear whether in this second quote he's implying that Einstein was the astronomer who said the first thing but then later revised his opinion about the size of the universe (an idea Einstein was suggesting at least as far back as 1920, see <a class="external text" href="http://www.bartleby.com/173/31.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>, though he never actually "proved" it, or if in this quote he's imagining the astronomer as a separate person, and the two quotes are just inconsistent (whether because he wanted to attribute the quote to someone important-sounding, or because he just remembered it differently in the two books). Also, it says <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fritz_Perls#Life" title="w:Fritz Perls">here</a> that <i>Ego, Hunger, and Aggression</i> was originally published in 1942, though the version on google books is from 1969, so it might be a later edition and I don't know if the quote about the astronomer and human stupidity was in the original or if it was added in a later revision ("The Quote Investigator" seems to say <a class="external text" href="http://quoteinvestigator.com/2010/05/04/universe-einstein/#more-173" rel="nofollow">here</a> that it was in a 1940s version, I guess either 1942 or the second edition in 1947). Anyway, seems pretty dubious to me. <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/User:Hypnosifl" title="User:Hypnosifl">Hypnosifl</a> 04:18, 4 August 2011 (UTC)</li>
<li>Also, it may be unrelated, but in the 1920 book "My Second Country" by Robert Dell, on <a class="external text" href="http://books.google.com/books?id=iXpHAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA276#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" rel="nofollow">page 276</a> I found a somewhat similar quote: "Renan said that the only thing that gave him any conception of infinity was human stupidity". And if you search google books for keywords "Renan", "infinity", and "stupidity" you find others, including <a class="external text" href="http://books.google.com/books?id=cTPmAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=renan%20infinity%20stupidity&amp;pg=PA1126#v=onepage&amp;q=renan%20infinity%20stupidity&amp;f=false" rel="nofollow">this one from 1915</a> which is even closer to the one Perls attributes to "a great astronomer"--in this case, the quote is "He quotes the saying of Renan: it isn't the stars that give him an idea of infinity; it is man's stupidity." <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_Renan" title="w:Ernest Renan">Ernest Renan</a> was not an astronomer, but he was a philosopher who apparently had an interest in the idea of an infinite universe, see <a class="external text" href="http://books.google.com/books?id=N04oAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA204#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" rel="nofollow">p. 204 of 'Life of Ernest Renan'</a> from 1895 (search google books for "Ernest Renan infinity" for more). According to <a class="external text" href="http://www.evene.fr/citations/mot.php?mot=betise" rel="nofollow">this page</a> the original French version was "La bêtise humaine est la seule chose qui donne une idée de l'infini" and it comes from <a class="external text" href="http://www.archive.org/details/dialoguesetfrag02renagoog" rel="nofollow">"Dialogues et fragments philosophiques"</a>, though when I searched the text for the word "humaine" I couldn't find the quote there. I suppose it's possible the quote was misattributed to Renan before it was misattributed to Einstein; searching google books for "bêtise humaine" and "l'infini", some attribute it to Voltaire...and <a class="external text" href="http://books.google.com/books?id=9NEaAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA465#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" rel="nofollow">this 1904 book</a> gives a different version on p. 465, "Ce n'est pas l'immensité de la vôute étoilée qui peut donner le plus complétement l'ideé de l'infini, mais bien la bêtise humaine!" which translates roughly to "it is not the starry sky that can give the most complete idea of the infinite, but human stupidity!" which sounds a lot like the Einstein quote and is from before Einstein was famous...<a class="external text" href="http://books.google.com/books?id=lBUbAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA19#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" rel="nofollow">this 1903 book</a> also gives the same quote at the bottom of p. 19. Meanwhile the book "Des vers" by Guy de Maupassant, which says on <a class="external text" href="http://books.google.com/books?id=cQUvAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PP9#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" rel="nofollow">p. 9</a> that it's from 1880, also has a quote from a letter by Gustav Flaubert on <a class="external text" href="http://books.google.com/books?id=cQUvAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PP21#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" rel="nofollow">p. 21</a>, "Cependant, qui sait? La terre a des limites, mais la bêtise humaine est infinie!" which translates to "But who knows? The earth has its boundaries, but human stupidity is infinite!" It may just be an old cliché rather than something Flaubert invented, <a class="external text" href="http://books.google.com/books?id=n9cOAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA273#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" rel="nofollow">this page</a> which is also dated 1880 but is from a different author says something similar ("Aujourd'hui je sais qu'il n'y a pas de limites à la bêtise humaine, qu'elle est infinie" or "today I know that there is no limit to human stupidity, it is infinite"). Anyway, regardless of whether Renan said a quote like this, do you folks think this is enough to put it in the "misattributed" section, or at least "disputed"? <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/User:Hypnosifl" title="User:Hypnosifl">Hypnosifl</a> 07:43, 4 August 2011 (UTC)
<dl><dd>This manner of speaking strikes me as very uncharacteristic of Einstein, but it might be included in the Misattributed section if it is widely attributed in sources that might reasonably be considered reliable. I am not enthusiastic about listing everything that circulates on the web or mostly appears in unreliable sources, particularly for someone like Einstein to whom practically everything has been attributed sometime by somebody. ~ <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/User:Ningauble" title="User:Ningauble">Ningauble</a> 13:29, 4 August 2011 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<ul><li><dl><dd>In the "sourced" section I agree we should only put quotes with good sources (either Einstein's own writings/speeches or someone who knew him personally). But when there's specific evidence that a given quote is misattributed, I think it's good to add it to the "disputed" or "misattributed" sections, so it can be "debunked" for people looking for it. The problem in this case is that it's a little ambiguous, both in terms of whether Perls' two mentions of this quote are inconsistent with each other (in the earlier one it does sound like the "great astronomer" is separate from Einstein, but it's not totally clear), and in terms of whether the similar quote attributed to Ernest Renan earlier ("it is not the starry sky that can give the most complete idea of the infinite, but human stupidity!") can be considered an "earlier version" of the quote attributed to Einstein even though they aren't exactly the same. <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/User:Hypnosifl" title="User:Hypnosifl">Hypnosifl</a> 16:52, 4 August 2011 (UTC)</dd></dl></li></ul></li>

<p>Regarding the bit about Einstein being a Mathematician, being well versed in
Mathematics does <i>not</i> make one a mathematician.  Furthermore, the term
<i>well-versed</i> is subjective at best.  While many laypeople would consider
most physicists to be well-versed in mathematics, we mathematicians generally
would only consider a mathematician to be someone who publishes work on
(usually) abstract mathmatics.  Note publishes, note abstract.  A paper on
physics, or chemistry, or, hell, island biogeography may contain a substantial
amount of math.  But in this context it is being used as a tool to model the
real world; mathematicians study math for its own sake.  Mathematicians with
a predominant interest in the mathematics of physics are generally called
"mathematical physicists".  Einstein, as much as we all love him, was not
either of these things.  His primary interest was physics, and his published
papers were also on physics.  There is no evidence that he even tinkered in
Math for its own sake.  Heck, the math in his papers wasn't even much more
advanced than linear algebra, PDEs and tensor algebra, all things that I
studied as an undergrad, and none of them new mathematically -- he relied
heavily on Reimannian geometry and Differential topology concepts, none of
them new when his paper was published, and certainly none authored by him.
</p><p>As you probably are neither a physicist nor a mathematician, let me let you
know: there is a certain about of (friendly) rivalry between the two
disciplines, and mathematicians and physicists both often resent being misappropriated.  Einstein was a physicist, and a good one, but he was not
a mathematician.
</p><p><br/>
I agree with you on that view. It could possibly be argued, however, that he is an applied mathematician -- because he took mathematics and applied it to create a new type of science. His primary activity was Physics, however, and that is how he ought to be described. Because of the public's perception of physicists as mathematicians the laity would name the likes of Einstein as their mathematicians rather than Godel, Cantor, Ramanujan, Gauss or GH Hardy. Despite the use of advanced mathematics in physics, mathematicians and physicists are very different beasts altogether. Physics is a science in the strictest sense. Its primary methodology is the Scientific Method. <a class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_beauty">Mathematics on the other hand is an art form</a>. And it abhors the Scientific Method. -- xsistor

<p>He was a physicist, not a mathematician. No mathematicians consider him one, no physicists consider him one, no historians consider him one. Smart guy, good at math, not a "mathematician," which is a specific discipline separate from theoretical physics. Some people were both. Einstein was not. This is nothing negative.

<p>I doubt the authenticity of many "quotations" of Einstein that are often provided without a source, including several on the article page, but some of these have circulated for years. I am removing one from the page that seems to be of very recent creation, and almost certainly spurious, :

<blockquote>
<dl><dd><i>In the view of such harmony in the cosmos which I, with my limited human mind, am able to recognize, there are yet people who say there is no God. But what makes me really angry is that they quote me for supporting such views.</i> (p.97)</dd></dl>

<p class="mw-empty-elt"></p><p>

I can find no evidence that this "quotation" existed anywhere on the web, nor anywhere in the entire world, prior to its posting here on 23 April 2005. At present the only other hits that I encounter in a Google search are of a very few sites, where the material of the entire page has plainly been <i>derived</i> from that of Wikiquote. I am strongly inclined to believe that this is simply a made-up statement by someone who does not much knowledge of the complex opinions of Einstein, nor much of an attachment to the ideals of rigorous veracity which he greatly exhibited.

Over the years I have read <i>many</i> of Einstein's own writings, much about him, and have encountered numerous quotations of Einstein that make plain his general embrace of both the importance of  a "cosmic religious feeling" and a rejection of most existing notions and conventional doctrines of a <i>personal</i> "God", including explicit statements that endorse some of the concepts of <a class="mw-redirect" href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Spinoza" title="Spinoza">Spinoza</a>.

I feel this project should permit many quotations without a source in the "attributed" sections of articles, yet, those which are of such content as stands contrary to known and sourced quotations, should be investigated, and not be too readily retained, <i>especially</i> if there is no evidence of them ever having been cited elsewhere, prior to their posting here. ~ <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/User:Achilles" title="User:Achilles">Achilles</a> 10:37, 9 Jun 2005 (UTC)

What is the sense in highlighting some of the quotes? Just because some of the editors here perceive them to be important does not mean that Einstien also agrees with the subjective judgement implied.
When something is emphasised it implies that it is the origional authors emphasis and does not represent the full picture of what einstien himself had to say by making the unemphasised quotes seem trivial.

</p><dl><dd>Einstein didn't say <i>quotes</i> even -- he usually talked, or wrote, at length. The very act of quoting is deciding some part is more meaningful than others. Bolding partial quotes means that the bold part is more meaningful than the rest, which was mostly left for context. Usually it's because the bold part is famous in general. ~ <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/User:MosheZadka" title="User:MosheZadka">MosheZadka</a> <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/User_talk:MosheZadka" title="User talk:MosheZadka">(Talk)</a> 09:28, 10 August 2005 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<ul><li>I added the above discussed quote with its original source.  I don't see how Achilles would have trouble finding it pre 23 April 2005 as it is cited in many locations previous,was first said to Prince Hubertus zu Lowenstein in 1941, and published in Lowenstein's book in 1968. Here's the quote with its source:</li></ul><p>

In view of such harmony in the cosmos which I, with my limited human mind, am able to recognize, there are yet people who say there is no God. But what makes me really angry is that they quote me for support of such views. 
Said to German anti-Nazi diplomat and author Hubertus zu Lowenstein around 1941. Quoted in his book, Towards the Further Shore, London, 1968, 156. 

Although Einstein said he would be considered an atheist "from the point of view of a Jesuit priest", he repeatedly denied being one in fact.  A Jesuit would consider anyone an atheist who did not believe in the personal anthropomorphic deity of Christianity.  This personal deity is only one part of the spectrum of religious/spiritual beliefs.  Einstein's fits on the other end, where rests the "transcendent" deity completely unconcerned with human affairs.

<p>The nationality is not the passport you have. It is rather the place you were born or the place you choose to live. Einstein left Switzerland for good when he decided to recover his German citizenship. He explicitely renounced his German citizenship when got political asylum in the US.
I think that in the case of Einstein, it is more correct to say the he was a German born, US citizen (Not American, please!!).

<dl><dd>I love that everyone wants to claim him.  But a German-born U.S. citizen is the kid of a U.S. citizen born in Germany.  Einstein was a citizen of Germany, Switzerland, and the U.S.  And yet, he was neither Swiss nor American.  How about calling him a German-born Jew, who was for a time a Swiss citizen, and then became a U.S. citizen in his later years (1940).<a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/99.60.230.175" title="Special:Contributions/99.60.230.175">99.60.230.175</a></dd></dl>

<dd>Except that I never mentioned relativistic mass. I was merely pointing out that the correct form was to use m<sub>0</sub> the mass in the rest frame. I merely hadn't bothered to lookup the tag to subscript the zero. Anyway the rest frame is identical to the Lorenz expansion with the velocity v set to zero , which is all I said. You might understand GR but maybe you should learn to read a bit more carefully. :) <a class="new" href="https://en.wikiquote.org/w/index.php?title=User:Lucien86&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="User:Lucien86 (page does not exist)">Lucien86</a> 14:24, 1 September 2011 (UTC)
<dl><dd>When you said the "Using the full Lorenz version is identical, but only if you specify that v = 0", I thought it meant you were saying that your version, E=m<sub>0</sub>c<sup>2</sup>, was better because it would apply even if v was <i>not</i> 0. If that's not what you meant your comment was a bit confusing (I guess I'm not sure what "the full Lorenz version" means--version of what?), what was supposed to be the advantage of E=m<sub>0</sub>c<sup>2</sup> over E=mc<sup>2</sup>? When m is presented without a subscript it generally just means the rest mass as well, and plenty of textbooks do just use m for rest mass, m<sub>0</sub> is only used by authors who <i>also</i> talk about the relativistic mass (which, as I said, most modern authors do not), in order to differentiate rest mass from relativistic mass. <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/User:Hypnosifl" title="User:Hypnosifl">Hypnosifl</a> 16:58, 1 September 2011 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd>
<dd>He didn't <i>say</i> "m<sub>0</sub>", so "m<sub>0</sub>" is <i>not</i> part of the quote. By "m" he generally referred to what we call rest mass, so he was evidently referring to the energy of mass at rest, or to the component of total energy attributable thereto independent of reference frame; but as is often said, it's all relative. As I often say, quotations by their very nature are taken out of context. Call it the <i>general theory of the relativity of quotes</i>. What he meant by what he <i>did</i> say, or whether he was right or wrong, is not up to Wikiquote. ~ <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/User:Ningauble" title="User:Ningauble">Ningauble</a>
<dl><dd>I didn't get what you were saying for a moment there Hyposifl and Ningauble but yes of course it makes sense not to use it. Come to think of it we all use m all the time and whatever the velocity  m is always still written in terms of the the rest frame. I must have been half asleep when I did that - then compounded it with the second comment. :( It was the unsigned guy using the m without the subscript in the relativistic momentum equation that threw me, I use relativistic KE quite a lot and just kind of picked up on using it.

<p>I believe this comes from Michele de Montaigne (1533-1592). I can't recall the French, but it begins, "C'est qui ce conçoit bien, [what you understand well,...] And says something like "If you can't say it simply, then you don't yet understand it well enough."

<dl><dd><i>Buddhism has the characteristics of what would be expected in a cosmic religion for the future: It transcends a personal God, avoids dogmas and theology; it covers both the natural and the spiritual, and it is based on a religious sense aspiring from the experience of all things, natural and spiritual, as a meaningful unity.</i></dd></dl>
<p>I've personally discussed the reliability of this quote with Einstein scholars (including John Stachel at Boston U, and founding editor of T<i>he Collected Papers of Albert Einstein</i>), and with the authors of compilations of Einstein quotations (Thomas J.

<li>"Philosophy is like a mother who gave birth to and endowed all the other sciences. Therefore, one should not scorn her in her nakedness and poverty, but should hope, rather, that part of her Don Quixote ideal will live on in her children so that they do not sink into philistinism." - p. 106 - 28 Sep 32</li>

<p>I am trying to find a definitive and sourced quote for Einstein's statement about thermodynamics. Ironcially, entropy seems apply to the statement itself. Below is a partial list of the various quotes I have collected so far. While some of the differences are trival (e.g., "Therefore" vs. Therefore,"), some are quite significant (e.g., "applicability of its concepts" vs. "applicability of its basic concepts"). I don't own a copy of "Autobiographical Notes", so I'd appreciate it if someone who has a copy could ACCURATELY (!) post the quotation from there. Here is the list:

Earlier in the Notes, Einstein had sung the praises of classical thermodynamics, “the only physical theory of universal content concerning which I am convinced that, within the framework of the applicability of its basic concepts, it will never be overthrown”. Now, he explains how the very structure of the theory was influential in the search for a way out of the turn-of-the-century crisis in physics.

<p>--- 
This is from the 1971 edition of "Albert Einstein: Philosopher-Scientist." The first section of the book is his own "Autobiographical notes."  His original German text is on one side of the page, the English translation (by the book's editor, Paul Arthur Schilpp) is on the facing page.
</p><p>Eine Theorie ist desto eindrucksvoller, je grösser die Einfachheit ihrer Prämissen ist, je verschiedenartigere Dinge sie verknüpft, und je weiter ihr Anwendungsbereich ist. Deshalb der tiefe Eindruck, den die klassische Thermodynamik auf mich machte. Es ist die einzige physikalische Theorie allgemeinen Inhaltes, von der ich überzeugt bin, dass sie im Rahmen der Anwendbarkeit ihrer Grundbegriffe niesmals umgestossen werden wird (zur besonderen Beachtung der grundsätzlichen Skeptiker).
</p><p>A theory is the more impressive the greater the simplicity of its premises is, the more different kinds of things it relates, and the more extended is its area of applicability. Therefore the deep impression which classical thermodynamics made upon me. It is the only physical theory of universal content concerning which I am convinced that, within the framework of the applicability of its basic concepts, it will never be overthrown (for the special attention of those who are skeptics on principle).

<p>With regard to the attributed "Everything should be made as simple as possible, but no simpler" quote, which is listed here under "The supreme goal of all theory is to make the irreducible basic elements as simple and as few as possible without having to surrender the adequate representation of a single datum of experience," I wanted to add what may be the German original:
</p><p>„Das Oberste Ziel aller Theorie ist, die nicht reduzierbaren grundlegenden Elemente zu bilden, wie einfach und nur möglich, ohne zu müssen, die ausreichende Darstellung eines Einzelnen Bezugspunktes der Erfahrung zu übergeben.“ -- Albert Einstein (1933)

"The basic concepts and laws which are not logically further reducible constitute the indispensable and not rationally reducible part of the theory.

I'm a novice here, and don't know if this is the proper way of adding information - if not I apologise.
</p><p>Some time ago I tried to track down the original source of "Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler". The earliest citation I could find was Readers Digest 111(666):164, October 1977. Section "Quotable Quotes" has 
EVERYTHING should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler. -Albert Einstein. 
</p><p>I e-mailed Readers Digest as follows: 
&lt;begin&gt;
To:	'yousaidit@readersdigest.co.uk'
Subject:	Quotable Quotes: October 1977
</p><p>Dear Sirs,
</p><p>I recognise that I am probably asking the impossible, but I thought I'd try.
</p><p>In my field of science, and many others, an oft quoted dictum is attributed to Albert Einstein; "Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler." Being a bit of a pedant, and not wanting to quote something I haven't seen, I've been seeking the original source. 
</p><p>The earliest attribution I've been able to find is to the Reader's Digest in October 1977. I've borrowed that issue from the British Library and found the phrase on page 164 under "Quotable Quotes". However, as Einstein died on 18 April 1955, the quotations origin must be earlier.
</p><p>By any chance, do you have any record of the source of the October 1977 item?
</p><p>With best regards, and thanks in advance,
&lt;end&gt;
to which the response was "I typed the Albert Einstein quote into Google and that brought up very many references.  May I suggest you do the same?". A further e-mail asking for their source, rather than people citing them, elicited no response.

<dl><dd>This is probably a paraphrase of something he said less succinctly, a generalization of something he said more specifically, or a fabrication of something he might likely have agreed with.

<dl><dd>While I agree with you that the quote is unlikely to be by Einstein -- the language is a little too modern to my ear, and the phrasing of it somewhat more glib that in authentic Einstein quotes -- it <i><b>is</b></i>, nonetheless, listed on a number of quote websites as being by Einstein, so it is, in fact, a quote that is being <b>attributed</b> to him -- so it was appropriate for it to be in the "Unsourced" section.  It's not listed in <b>The New Quotable Einstein</b> (2005), and none of the hits I got for it give a source, but, absence of evidence not being evidence of absence, there's no hard evidence one way or the other for its authenticity or lack thereof.  On balance, I'm not planning on restoring it, primarily because it "sounds" off to me, despite the fact that there are several legitimate Einstein quotes dealing with the subject of imagination. <a class="mw-redirect" href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/User:Ed_Fitzgerald" title="User:Ed Fitzgerald">Ed Fitzgerald</a> 06:04, 4 August 2007 (UTC)</dd></dl>

<dl><dd><i>A human being is a part of the whole, called by us the 'Universe', a part limited in time and space. He experiences himself, his thoughts and feelings, as something separate from the rest - a kind of optical delusion of his consciousness. This delusion is a kind of prison for us, restricting us to our personal desires and to affection for a few persons nearest to us. Our task must be to free ourselves from this prison by widening our circle of compassion to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty. Nobody is able to achieve this completely, but the striving for such achievement is in itself a part of the liberation and a foundation for inner security.</i> - <b>New York Post, 28 November 1972</b></dd></dl>

<dl><dd>Such citations can be of someone's <i>immediate</i> source, and it might even indicate the date of the first translation or publication of the expression in this form.

In some works the <i>ultimate</i> source is stated to be a letter from 1950, but I find no quotations of it earlier than 1972. It was also published in <i>The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists</i> in 1981, which can probably be trusted as reliable, and in many books, so I will add it to the page with the NY Post citation as the earliest I have found. ~ <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/User:Kalki" title="User:Kalki">Kalki</a> 06:25, 6 October 2007 (UTC)</dd></dl>

<p>Germany was exclusively <i>jus sanguinis</i> right up until 1990, and Jews were not permitted citizenship until after World War II. They weren't even legally allowed to call themselves "Germans;" that much, at least, is correct. So was Einstein really a German citizen?

<p>Is there any <b>real</b> proof that Einstein said: <i>"The world is a dangerous place to live, not because of the people who are evil, but because of the people who don't do anything about it."</i>. I see this quote mentioned a lot, especially the variant (<i>"to live [...] those who do evil, [...] those who look on and do nothing."</i>), but there are no sources. The source Wikipedia uses is a book called Breakthrough: Israel in a Changing World. This book can be read on-line (<a class="external autonumber" href="http://books.google.com/books?id=iWkzKAMOs88C" rel="nofollow">[12]</a>) and on the mentioned page, it says: <i>"Albert Einstein once said: [...]"</i>. Again, the question remains: did Einstein <b>really</b> say this. Ever. Anywhere. As far as I can tell there is no proof for this, at all. A source that itself is not trustworthy, is not useful. If a former Israeli Minister - that is what Gad Yaacobi was - says that Albert Einstein <b>once said</b> this, is that really a useful source? --<a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/82.171.70.54" title="Special:Contributions/82.171.70.54">82.171.70.54</a> 14:33, 8 November 2008 (UTC)

<p>According to my research, Einstein was indeed first to use the phrase. Reference is Letters to Solovine: 1906-1955. Clearly this predates the other mentioned source.

<p>I believe that this quote actually originated with a psychologist by the name of George Kelly.  However, the original quote was modified to what we see today.  George Kelly, in his book entitled _The Psychology of Personal Constructs_ (1955), stated that personality dysfunction is the result of, “any personal construction which is used repeatedly in spite of consistent invalidation”.

<dl><dd>The above is unsigned.  Can anyone verify it, provide better citation, quote etc?</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>I went looking and found <a class="external text" href="http://davidcenter.com/documents/Journal%20Articles/GEORGE_A_KELLY.pdf" rel="nofollow">this pdf</a> which says "Finally, pathology is defined by Kelly as “any personal construction which is used repeatedly in spite of consistent invalidation (Kelly in Pervin, 1970, p. 355)."

</p><p><i>As a Jewish scientist he had to flee from Nazi Germany, but it should be noted that he did not believe in traditional notions of a personal god, but rather perceived God to be a "superpersonal" entity, in ways that he declared to be inspired by Baruch Spinoza's and Arthur Schopenhauer's ideas.

<dl><dd><dl><dd>I thought this language was a bit strongly stilted toward some conventional notions of God, which plainly Einstein had objections to, and on 22 February 2007 added a bit more precision to counter that; I was actually surprised that it stood without significant alteration for nearly 3 years:

<p>I don't think symbols that are particular to a single religion should be used for quotes that aren't about that specific religion. Kalki's justification for including a Kabbalistic and Taoistic symbol was that these symbols "relate to the quoted statements they are used with in both clear and subtle ways — they are not bound to any fix dogmas, but indicative of mysteries beyond dogmas". But isn't this a form of editorializing, saying that Kabbalah and Taoism are somehow "not bound to any fixed dogmas"? If someone put in a big Christian cross or a symbol for Scientology to accompany a quote where Einstein was talking about his nondenominational philosophical beliefs, people would probably object. How could we justify using some religious symbols but not others (for quotes that don't discuss any specific religion, by a person who was not a follower of any specific religion) without appearing to endorse the notion that some religions are closer to cosmic truths than others? <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/User:Hypnosifl" title="User:Hypnosifl">Hypnosifl</a> 16:41, 16 April 2010 (UTC)
</p>
<dl><dd>Also, on the subject of Kabbalist beliefs in particular, I doubt Einstein would have seen them as much in line with his own thinking, given this quote from <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein#Albert_Einstein:_The_Human_Side_.281954.29" title="Albert Einstein">Albert Einstein: The Human Side</a>: <i>The mystical trend of our time, which shows itself particularly in the rampant growth of the so-called Theosophy and Spiritualism, is for me no more than a symptom of weakness and confusion. Since our inner experiences consist of reproductions, and combinations of sensory impressions, the concept of a soul without a body seem to me to be empty and devoid of meaning.</i> <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/User:Hypnosifl" title="User:Hypnosifl">Hypnosifl</a> 16:48, 16 April 2010 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<dl><dd>The above quote is a very good one, and one that might go easily overlooked without some image to provide it a greater profile on the page, so I might add one to that. But as the quotes are about religion in general, and there are already quotes related to specific religious traditions with images on the page, when I first added these many years ago, on this highly edited page, I thought that these, actually less bound to many of the normal theistic notions of religion were quite appropriate to the quotes, which relate well to one of my favorite statements by him:
<dl><dd>All religions, arts and sciences are branches of the same tree. All these aspirations are directed toward ennobling man's life, lifting it from the sphere of mere physical existence and leading the individual towards freedom. It is no mere chance that our older universities developed from clerical schools. Both churches and universities — insofar as they live up to their true function — serve the ennoblement of the individual. They seek to fulfill this great task by spreading moral and cultural understanding, renouncing the use of brute force.</dd></dl></dd>
<dd>I certainly can agree that dogmas exist, even when they are not recognized as dogmas — especially the ranges of dogma among modern materialists that only overtly religious and mystical traditions involve any form of dogma. I actually assert that some form of dogma is pretty much unavoidable among people, but a willingness to see beyond one's own particular ranges of dogma is always valuable, as Einstein often emphasized. ~ <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/User:Kalki" title="User:Kalki">Kalki</a> (<a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/User_talk:Kalki" title="User talk:Kalki">talk</a> · <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Kalki" title="Special:Contributions/Kalki">contributions</a>) 17:07, 16 April 2010 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>I do think Einstein would have been sympathetic to the Taoist philosophy if he had been aware of it (and I am very sympathetic to it myself), it's just that I think we should avoid the appearance of editorializing, since it's a personal judgment call as to which religions and philosophies are more similar to Einstein's views. I think the best policy is to avoid using religious symbols unless they are accompanying a quote which mentioned that specific religious tradition. <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/User:Hypnosifl" title="User:Hypnosifl">Hypnosifl</a> 17:39, 16 April 2010 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>I am confident that Einstein had at least some acquaintance with Taoist ideas, but even if he is not specifically mentioning Taoism, the most ancient form of the Taijitu symbol is one that predates any specific formal doctrines that might be associated with it (as would the cross, the swastika or the star of <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/David" title="David">David</a> for that matter), and the images I chose, years ago, for these quotes were employed as symbols I perceived to be only tangentially related to any creeds, and to some extent well-related, graphically and conceptually to the themes he was making statements upon: The most ancient swirling of the Taijitu of dark and light revolving around a stable center which is beyond the definitions of either, evoking well the "sense that behind anything that can be experienced there is a something that our mind cannot grasp" (though that one was actually just chosen today, after your objections to the Vedic AUM symbol, which I also thought to be quite appropriate),  the rather subtle grey on white Taijitu symbol in a quote stating "there remains something subtle, intangible and inexplicable", and the Kabbalistic Tree of Life symbol superimposed on the more extensive and universal flower of life symbol — the Tree as something which arises within the flower, (and both patterns arising to perceptions within the mind of the perceiver, within the all pervading Kosmos). ~ <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/User:Kalki" title="User:Kalki">Kalki</a> (<a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/User_talk:Kalki" title="User talk:Kalki">talk</a> · <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Kalki" title="Special:Contributions/Kalki">contributions</a>) 18:42, 16 April 2010 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>I don't think you've addressed the main element of my criticism, which is that by attaching these images to the quotes you are inserting your own opinions about the merits of different religions (or at least their similarity to Einstein's ideas). If it was a Christian cross or a Scientology symbol emerging from a flower, would you be equally happy with that image? If not, isn't that an expression of your opinions about Kabbalism being more in line with Einstein than Christianity or Scientology? Wikiquote does have a <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Wikiquote:Neutral_point_of_view" title="Wikiquote:Neutral point of view">neutral point of view</a> policy. And I don't see how Einstein's quote has anything to do with ideas about the interdependence of the external world with the "mind of the perceiver", since Einstein seems to have believed in an objective physical world which existed regardless of observation by conscious beings, and that humans are purely physical entities.</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>I also wouldn't be so sure that Einstein had any real knowledge of Taoism, some of the quotes about Buddhism suggest his acquaintance with it was mainly based on Schopenhauer's writings, which reflected the distorted and overly pessimistic 19th century views of Buddhism. More accurate understanding of Eastern philosophies didn't really become common in the West until the 1950s and '60s. The Taijitu symbol may be very ancient but so is the cross and the star of David, the point is that both are in the present associated with specific religious beliefs. And Einstein's quote doesn't seem to have any great affinity for the symbol anyway, since it doesn't express any idea of the blending or balance of opposites that seems to be central to the meaning of the symbol.</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>Anyway, if we can't come to agreement on these images, I suggest we wait for others to weigh in here, hopefully some kind of consensus can be reached. <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/User:Hypnosifl" title="User:Hypnosifl">Hypnosifl</a> 19:40, 16 April 2010 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<p>A possible origin of Einstein "quote":
</p>
<ul><li>I also remember a remark of Albert Einstein, which certainly applies to music. He said, in effect, that everything should be as simple as it can be, but not simpler.
<ul><li>Roger Sessions, “How a ‘difficult’ composer gets that way”, <i>New York Times</i>, January 8, 1950, Arts &amp; Leisure section, <a class="external text" href="http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F30615FE3559137A93CAA9178AD85F448585F9" rel="nofollow">p. 89</a></li></ul></li></ul>
<p>This certainly appears to be a paraphrase—“<i>in effect</i>”—and, since it's in the <i>New York Times</i>, it's prominent enough to have been the source of this quotation.
</p><p><br/>
</p>
<ul><li>There is also the other side of the same coin minted by Einstein: “Everything should be as simple as it can be, but not simpler”—a scientist's defense of art and knowledge—of lightness, completeness and accuracy.
<ul><li>Louis Zukofsky (June 1950). "Poetry in a Modern Age". <i>Poetry</i> <b>76</b> (3): 177-180. JSTOR <a class="external text" href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/20591281" rel="nofollow">20591281</a>.</li></ul></li></ul>
<p>I was initially quite excited by this since Zukofsky was not just a casual observer of Einstein; he <a class="external text" href="http://books.google.com/books?id=QNBlAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=+%22albert+einstein:+a+biographical+portrait%22" rel="nofollow">had translated</a> <i>Albert Einstein: a biographical portrait</i> decades earlier.  Maybe there was something to this quote, after all! In Zukofsky's book <i>Prepositions</i>, (and in <a class="external text" href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/25086823" rel="nofollow">“An Old Note on WCW”</a>), it appears that Zukovsky wrote this bit <a class="external text" href="http://books.google.com/books?id=sBPfUsOE7QcC&amp;pg=PA51&amp;dq=%22as+simple+as+it+can+be%22+1948" rel="nofollow">in 1948</a>. But it was first published five months after Sessions's essay in the NYT and, elsewhere, <a class="external text" href="http://books.google.com/books?id=QNBlAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=sessions" rel="nofollow">Zukofsky apparently quoted other parts of that essay</a>, so I think that the 1948 date is probably wrong or that sentence was added to the essay in 1950. But it could be that the quote actually predates 1950.
</p><p>Zukofsky also <a class="external text" href="http://books.google.com/books?id=SByBfdZJGeIC&amp;pg=PA110&amp;dq=%22Everything+should+be+as+simple+as+it+can+be,+Says+Einstein%22" rel="nofollow">used the quote</a> in part 12 of his poem “A”.
</p><p><br/>
From the 1960s:

<p>The anonymous tip above about the source of the quote proved to be true.
</p><p>The “Tribute to Pablo Casals” was solicited for and appeared in the book
<i>Conversations avec Pablo Casals: souvenirs et opinions d'un musicien</i>
by José María Corredor (1954). The book was translated into
many languages including German, <i>Gespräche mit Casals</i> (1954), and 
English, <i>Conversations with Casals</i> (1957).
</p><p>The original text from Einstein (Einstein Archive Catalog #34-347), and
as it appeared in the German edition (emphasis added):
</p>
<ul><li>Die Wertschätzung Pablo Casals' als großen Künstler braucht fürwahr nicht auf mich zu warten, denn hierin herrscht Einstimmigkeit unter den Auguren. Was ich aber an ihm besonders bewundere, ist seine charaktervolle Haltung nicht nur gegen die Unterdrücker seines Volkes, sondern auch gegen alle diejenigen Opportunisten, die immer bereit sind, mit dem Teufel zu paktieren. Er hat klar erkannt, daß <b>die Welt mehr bedroht ist durch die, welche das Übel dulden oder ihm Vorschub leisten, als durch die Übeltäter selbst</b>.</li></ul>
<p>In the French edition:
</p>
<ul><li><p>Il n'était certes pas nécessaire d'attendre ma voix pour proclamer en Pablo Casals un très grand artiste, car à cet égard les avis autorisés sont unanimes.</p><p>Ce que j'admire cependant particulièrement en lui, c'est sa ferme attitude non seulement à l'endroit des oppresseurs de son peuple, mais également à l'endroit des opportunistes toujours prêts à pactiser avec le diable.</p><p>Il a su comprendre avec beaucoup de clairvoyance que <b>le monde court un plus grand danger de la part de ceux qui tolèrent le mal ou l'encouragent que de la part de ceux-là mêmes qui le commettent</b>.</p></li></ul>
<p>In the English  edition:
</p>
<ul><li>It is certainly unnecessary to await my voice in acclaiming Pablo Casals as a very great artist, since all who are qualified to speak are unanimous on this subject. What I particularly admire in him is the firm stand he has taken, not only against the oppressors of his countrymen, but also against those opportunists who are always ready to compromise with the Devil.  He perceives very clearly that <b>the world is in greater peril from those who tolerate or encourage evil than from those who actually commit it</b>.</li></ul>
<p><br/>
Variants:
</p>
<ul><li>The world is a dangerous place, not because of those who do evil, but because of those who look on and do nothing.</li>
<li>The world is a dangerous place to live, not because of the people who are evil, but because of the people who don't do anything about it.</li></ul>

<dl><dd>I generally object to needless removal of actual quotes of some interest, far more than such accumulation of them as some might find excessive. Most of the quotes that have been gathered here are widely quoted, or extensions of such quotes placed into context. Loose "guidelines" are such things as I generally do not object to being developed, to the extent they provide some <i>basis</i> for reasonable arguments for constraint, but unless they actually are derived from <i>legal</i> mandates, the habit of treating them as imperative is one which I do reject, as an imposition on the proper freedom to provide useful information. ~ <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/User:Kalki" title="User:Kalki">Kalki</a> (<a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/User_talk:Kalki" title="User talk:Kalki">talk</a> · <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Kalki" title="Special:Contributions/Kalki">contributions</a>) 22:55, 16 November 2010 (UTC)
<dl><dd>Although it might be possible to trim a little around the edges, it would not have much impact on the ginormity of the article unless we discard material that actually is fairly widely quoted.

<p>A nice quote floating around the net "If a cluttered desk signs a cluttered mind, Of what, then, is an empty desk a sign?".  When it is attributed, it seems to be to Einstein, but is that true?

<p>"By an application" from 1919 is well documented, although according to <a class="external text" href="http://www.archive.org/details/celebritiesofour000452mbp" rel="nofollow">Herman Bernstein 1924</a> page 267 it wasn't written by Einstein "at the request of the newspaper" (TIMES) (as Quotable Einstein claims) but as a reaction to "the description of me and my circumstances in the <i>Times</i>", probably the article <i>THE REVOLUTION IN SCIENCE - Einstein vs. Newton - Views of eminent physicists</i> in the <i>Times</i> of 8 November 1919, following the publication of the findings of Eddington's expedition by the Royal Society and the Royal Astronomical Society on 6 November 1919. That Einstein in an <i>address</i> to the Société française de philosophie at the Sorbonne on 6 April 1922 (the event is described <a class="external text" href="http://books.google.de/books?id=NhK6LIApE8UC&amp;pg=PA138" rel="nofollow">here on page 138</a>) could have found reason to speak of personal matters (his nationality, his Jewishness) is to me absolutely inconceivable. What could have caused him as a guest of honour in France to comment again, as he had done in November 1919 (shortly after the war), on "a tendency to discrimnate between men of science on nationalist grounds" (Herman Bernstein)? --<a class="new" href="https://en.wikiquote.org/w/index.php?title=User:Vsop.de&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="User:Vsop.de (page does not exist)">Vsop.de</a> 22:58, 10 August 2011 (UTC)
</p>
<dl><dd>I don't think Einstein was invoking his nationality or Jewishness in a proud way, rather it sounded to me like a <i>joke</i> about the possibility that various countries would try to claim his as "one of them" if his theory was successful, but disown as being from a foreign "enemy" country (or in Germany's case, disown him as a Jew) if his theory failed (and it seems to be sort of an of implication of the joke that he looks at such national-identity claims with a certain ironic distance). <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/User:Hypnosifl" title="User:Hypnosifl">Hypnosifl</a> 01:42, 11 August 2011 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<p>Of course what Einstein wrote for the TIMES is a joke, a joke he "enjoyed [...] so much that he repeated it for the benefit of Ehrenfest (Einstein to Paul Ehrenfest, 4 December 1919)", <a class="external text" href="http://www.alberteinstein.info/PDFs/CP7Doc25_pp206-211.pdf" rel="nofollow">Doc 25 p. 211 note 9</a>. I only doubt that he repeated it, unnoticed by the word for word record of the event, in an "address the French Philosophical Society at the Sorbonne (6 April 1922)". According to Ernst Gehrke Einstein had been reluctant to accept the invitation to Paris but had been urged to do so by Germany's foreign minister Walter Rathenau who hoped Einstein's visit would improve the image of Germany in France and French-German relations. Accordingly Germany did everything within her power to make Einstein appear as a German. cf. <a class="external text" href="http://www.bpb.de/popup/popup_druckversion.html?guid=4PUY9W" rel="nofollow">Grundmann 2005</a> and <a class="external text" href="http://www.alberteinstein.info/finding_aid/" rel="nofollow">alberteinstein.info: 1922 Visit to Paris contributes to normalization of French-German relations.</a>. Can one imagine that under these circumstances Einstein - not while drinking wine with colleagues, but in an official "address to the Societé" - could have stated: "<b>If</b> my theory of relativity is proven successful, <b>Germany will</b> claim me as a German ..", when Germany was doing exactly this already?  --<a class="new" href="https://en.wikiquote.org/w/index.php?title=User:Vsop.de&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="User:Vsop.de (page does not exist)">Vsop.de</a> 08:44, 11 August 2011 (UTC)
</p>
<dl><dd>What "word for word record of the event" are you referring to? Einstein didn't have a lot of respect for formality, I don't see why it's inherently implausible that he'd repeat the joke at an occasion like that. It's true the use of the word "if" is a bit odd given Eddington's confirmation of his prediction about the bending of light in 1919, but it's possible he was recalling something he had said earlier, or that "if" is a bad translation of his remarks. But you may be right that there's some confusion here, the New York Times article <a class="external text" href="http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F70E16FE385D157A93C4A81789D85F448385F9&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=einstein&amp;st=p" rel="nofollow">Einstein on Classifications</a> from Feb. 16 1930 reads in its entirety: <i>According to a Jewish Telegraphic Agency dispatch of Dec. 3 from Berlin, German papers have featured a summary of the address made by Professor Albert Einstein recently conferred an honorary degree upon him. He is reported to have said, "If my theory of relativity is proven correct, Germany will claim me as a German and France will declare that I am a citizen of the world. Should my theory prove untrue, France will say that I am a German and Germany will declare that I am a Jew."</i> First of all it's odd that in 1930 they would say this happened "recently" if it's from 1922 (and the <a class="external text" href="http://www.oxfordreference.com/pages/samplep-18.html" rel="nofollow">Oxford Reference Online</a> says instead that the quote is supposed to have been said at an "address at the Sorbonne, Paris, possibly early December 1929"), and also it's rather second-hand, it's possible that original German article simply mentioned this prior quote in their article without claiming that it was actually from an address to the Sorbonne, and that the "Jewish Telegraphic Agency dispatch" confused this with part of his address (I found an archived copy of the dispatch from the Jewish Telegraphic Agency but it doesn't give any additional information, see <a class="external text" href="http://archive.jta.org/article/1929/12/04/2780697/if-true-hes-german-if-not-hes-jewish" rel="nofollow">here</a>). Might help if we could find a copy of the 8 April 1922 article from the <i>Berliner Tageblatt</i> that's listed as a source in "Quotable Einstein". <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/User:Hypnosifl" title="User:Hypnosifl">Hypnosifl</a> 20:33, 11 August 2011 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<p>I mentioned the record of the "Séance du 6 Avril 1922" already on 9 August 2011: <a class="external free" href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/966376/La-theorie-de-la-relativite-dEinstein-a-la-Societe-francaise-de-philosophie" rel="nofollow">http://www.scribd.com/doc/966376/La-theorie-de-la-relativite-dEinstein-a-la-Societe-francaise-de-philosophie</a>. Of course it would help if we could find a copy of the 8 April 1922 article from the <i>Berliner Tageblatt</i>, the only source mentioned in Quotable Einstein besides a clipping from an unnamed French newspaper. But for the time being, one can have a look at Grundmann: <a class="external text" href="http://books.google.de/books?id=1bxYPMHPhGcC&amp;pg=PA137" rel="nofollow">The Einstein dossiers</a>. Page 137 quotes from a long article <a class="external text" href="http://alberteinstein.info/db/ViewDetails.do?DocumentID=13191" rel="nofollow">04/12/1922 Berliner Tageblatt</a> Paul Block, Der verborgene Einstein: "Because he (Einstein) has not said a single word that could be politically interpreted and reinterpreted, the serene glory of his scholarly renown is not marred by any garish flares."  Page 138 quotes from an interview Vossische Zeitung published on 18 April 1922: Einstein admitted that he "never made any secret out of having come to France as a representative of German science" and added: "You must also take into consideration that the invitation addressed to me by the Collège de France was addressed to a German Scholar." With this in mind: does it really make much sense to assume that Einstein in an address to the Société française de philosophie on 6 April 1922 joked about Germany claiming him as a German and France declaring him a citizen of the world (if ...)?  --<a class="new" href="https://en.wikiquote.org/w/index.php?title=User:Vsop.de&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="User:Vsop.de (page does not exist)">Vsop.de</a> 20:14, 21 August 2011 (UTC)

And can we be sure the transcript of the 6 April 1922 remarks (which seem to be of a sort of roundtable discussion rather than an 'address' by Einstein) is the same one the <i>Berliner Tageblatt</i> was covering on 8 April 1922? It seems likely, but it could be that he gave an address and then later participated in a roundtable discussion. Basically I agree that there is likely to be an error here, but the <i>Quotable Einstein</i> is generally a very trustworthy source and I'd be hesitant to declare it wrong without actually being able to check the full details, such as the original <i>Berliner Tageblatt</i> article. We might however note that there seems to be some confusion about this quote, given that the <a class="external text" href="http://www.oxfordreference.com/pages/samplep-18.html" rel="nofollow">Oxford Reference Online</a> gives a nearly identical quote and says it's from an "address at the Sorbonne, Paris, possibly early December 1929". <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/User:Hypnosifl" title="User:Hypnosifl">Hypnosifl</a> 01:39, 23 August 2011 (UTC)</dd></dl>

<p>"With enough energy you can do anything." - I remember reading this described as a 'famous' Einstein quote but now cant find it anywhere. The original source was something scientific, either a book or a journal but it was many years ago (probably over 20 years) - and I can no longer remember where it came from. A search of the internet finds little or nothing but the thing I realize is that the original might have been in German or was misquoted or was simply made-up or attributed to the wrong author. In science if something was only in one or two obscure books and is old its not uncommon not to find it on the internet at all. Thanks if anyone can help me. - <a class="new" href="https://en.wikiquote.org/w/index.php?title=User:Lucien86&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="User:Lucien86 (page does not exist)">Lucien86</a> 09:20, 30 August 2011 (UTC)

<dl><dd>“If we owe so little to the experience of others, how do you account for sudden leaps forward in the sphere of science? Do you ascribe your own discoveries to intuition or inspiration?”</dd>
<dd></dd>
<dd>“<b>I believe in intuitions and inspirations.</b> I sometimes feel that I am right. I do not know that I am. When two expeditions of scientists, financed by the Royal Academy, went forth to test my theory of relativity, I was convinced that their conclusions would tally with my hypothesis.

<dd></dd>
<dd>“I am enough of the artist to draw freely upon my imagination. <b>Imagination is more important than knowledge. Knowledge is limited. Imagination encircles the world.</b>”</dd></dl>
<p>Then a modified version appears in <i>Cosmic Religion with other Opinions and Aphorisms</i>, 1931 in this form:
</p>
<dl><dd>“<b>I believe in intuition and inspiration.</b> … At times I feel certain I am right while not knowing the reason.

<p>Einstein seems to be the only credited author of the book, there is no credited editor, so presumably he himself has adapted this from what he was quoted as saying in the Post interview. <a class="new" href="https://en.wikiquote.org/w/index.php?title=User:HisRuntyDogma&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="User:HisRuntyDogma (page does not exist)">HisRuntyDogma</a> (<a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/User_talk:HisRuntyDogma" title="User talk:HisRuntyDogma">talk</a>) 04:19, 25 March 2012 (UTC)

<p>I find many of the... illustrations... other than the picture of Einstein and maybe a couple of other ones near the top, detract from the credibility of the page.  Almost like they are putting a kind of New Age spin on things.  At the very least, some of the illustrations give  flavor to this page that as far as I can tell is unlikely to represent Einstein's own perspective.  Maybe I'm reading too much into it - what do the rest of y'all think?

<p>The section listing quotations in "Sidelights on Relativity" (1922) includes the sentence "I never commit to memory anything that can easily be looked up in a book." I've examined some editions of this work translated into English and cannot locate this quotation. For example, here is link to an edition at the Internet Archive that does not seem to contain the quote:
<a class="external free" href="http://archive.org/details/sidelightsonrela00einsuoft" rel="nofollow">http://archive.org/details/sidelightsonrela00einsuoft</a>
This is a translation by G. B. Jeffery and W. Perrett first published in 1922.
</p><p>Could someone tell me the precise edition that contains the quote. Also, where does the quote appear within the text. Does the edition mentioned above contain an alternative translation or was the sentence entirely omitted in the 1922 translation.

<p>It's thoroughly misleading to describe Einstein as a Humanist: a) he never self-identified as a Humanist; b) in Einstein's day the Humanist movement did not exist in the form that it does today (i.e. that of a 'secular religion'), so the term applied to Einstein is meaningless; c) his stated beliefs are not in accord with those of Humanism. Have a look at the Wikipedia pages on Einstein or his beleifs, compare the treatment Humanism gets there with prominence you're giving it here.

<dl><dd><b>Einstein's stated beliefs were not only clearly in accord with <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Humanism" title="Humanism">Humanism</a>, in the most broad and honorable senses of the word</b> (and not one used merely as a pejorative by those who would imply or insist its meaning should be restricted entirely to such ways as they or some other extremists for or against secular ways are inclined to use it), <b>but he clearly embraced explicitly Humanistic endeavors of many sorts.</b> You seem to strongly imply that "Humanism" currently has become an entirely "secular" stance and even go so far as to state that in Einstein's time "the Humanist movement did not exist in the form that it does today (i.e. that of a 'secular religion')." I am very familiar with the fact that many individuals and groups tend to use the term "Humanism" derisively <i>as if</i> it were merely the worship of the Human in all its flaws and deficiencies <i>rather</i> than, or in exclusion to any worship of God or Divinity, or Truths beyond human knowledge, or acceptance of any sort of overt <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Mysticism" title="Mysticism">mysticism</a> or spirituality, but it simple is <i>not</i> so. <b>Humanism ultimately is and has long been a very large umbrella term which has long included many religious sectarians as well as secular adherents who might also identify as agnostic, atheist, or extremely variously in relation to various theistic or other religious traditions.</b> Despite the efforts of some to constrain and restrict the term humanism and to use it as merely a synonym for "secularism" or even to make it a pejorative akin to <i>faithless</i> it is and ever has been a <i>faith in humanity</i> and the potentials of humanity to progress in affirmations of ethical values which  can either be based upon or contrasted with  those of various sectarian spiritual traditions. Though a <i>faith</i> in humanity, It is certainly not a mere <i>worship</i> of humanity — and especially not an exclusive or idolatrous worship of any human beings in any particular ideological states — such as many religious or political sectarians are often inclined towards, though they do not generally self-identify as either exclusionists or idolators. <b>Ultimately humanism is based neither on secularism nor sectarianism and exists NOT in contrast to any specific or general spiritual traditions but in contrast to absolutist dogmatism or authoritarianism in any form, religious or political. </b></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><b>I myself would go so far to say that not only Einstein and many scientists, but some of the greatest of religious leaders and mystics have actually been quite humanistic in much of their social orientation and aims, no matter how spartan or ascetic their own personal dispositions, nor what might be their particular stances on various theologies.</b> Many people in many ages have embraced generally humanistic stances rather than emphatic about doctrinal particulars, no matter how much those who came after them (sometimes even ostensibly and ostentatiously acting in their name) might have developed all sorts of them, such as they never laid down or demanded. There is much more I could say on this matter, but I do not wish to get too elaborate in presenting my own personal views on matters, and thus have actually trimmed out some of my initial observations, but at any rate, <b>I have already pointed out that Einstein was clearly and explicitly a supporter of such humanistic movements as the <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethical_movement" title="w:Ethical movement">Ethical Culture Society</a>, which was in many ways about specifically <i>humanistic</i> rather than doctrinally authoritarian as one could get, among those prominent in his time, in promoting diverse but unitive <i>ethical</i> imperatives and emphasizing beliefs that "morality is independent of theology."</b> This is actually fully in accord with what the current head of the Catholic Church, <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Pope_Francis" title="Pope Francis">Pope Francis</a> declared in May of last year: "<b>We all have a duty to do good. And this commandment for everyone to do good, I think, is a beautiful path towards peace.  If we, each doing our own part, if we do good to others, if we meet there, doing good, and we go slowly, gently, little by little, we will make that culture of encounter: we need that so much. We must meet one another doing good. ‘But I don’t believe, Father, I am an atheist!’ But do good: we will meet one another there.</b>" <br/>  It is also fully in accord with what an extraordinary mystical and ethical genius known as <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Jesus" title="Jesus">Jesus</a>, defying and rejecting the overly strict and restrictive conventions of his time asserted, when among many other liberalizing and liberating statements, he declared that "<b>the Sabbath was made for man — and not man for the sabbath</b>" — and the same rational applies to nearly any and all spiritual traditions which have been devised as various forms of either development or hindrance of human potentials to appreciate the divine essence which truly abides WITHIN Humanity as well as BEYOND it. ~ <font style="color:white;background:silver">♞<a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/User:Kalki/Kalkiswords" title="User:Kalki/Kalkiswords">☤</a><a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/User:Kalki/Magic" title="User:Kalki/Magic">☮</a>♌<a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/User:Kalki" title="User:Kalki">Kalki</a>·<a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/User_talk:Kalki" title="User talk:Kalki">†</a>·<a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/User:Kalki/index" title="User:Kalki/index">⚓</a>⊙<a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/User:Kalki/Chronology" title="User:Kalki/Chronology">☳</a><a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/User:Kalki/Vox_Box" title="User:Kalki/Vox Box">☶</a>⚡</font> 22:22, 17 February 2014 (UTC) + tweaks</dd></dl>

<dl><dd>Regarding the lettered points in HPotato's argument above (16 February 2014):</dd>
<dd>a) <i>he never self-identified as a Humanist</i> –
<dl><dd>This is simply false.

<dd>b) <i>in Einstein's day the Humanist movement did not exist in the form that it does today (i.e. that of a 'secular religion')</i> –
<dl><dd>This attempt at historical revisionism is meaningless. You cannot define the <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Humanist_Society_of_New_York" title="w:First Humanist Society of New York">First Humanist Society of New York</a> or the <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Humanist_Association" title="w:British Humanist Association">British Humanist Association</a> with which he was affiliated out of existence, nor wipe out centuries of humanist thought by claiming it did not exist.</dd></dl></dd>
<dd>c) <i>his stated beliefs are not in accord with those of Humanism</i> –
<dl><dd>I assume the use of a capital "H" (not capitalized in the article) here denotes some particular group or schism. This is like a Catholic saying Protestants are not "true" Christians (or the converse, since you are claiming primacy of a recent sect of humanists). Your opinion about the one true catechism of humanism is irrelevant.</dd></dl></dd>
<dd>This leaves only the question of <i>prominence</i> in the introduction. Given the large amount of public interest in Einstein's writings and opinions pertaining to this subject, and the large amount quoted in the article, mentioning his stance in the introduction is not undue emphasis. It is useful to introduce what the article contains. ~ <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/User:Ningauble" title="User:Ningauble">Ningauble</a> (<a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/User_talk:Ningauble" title="User talk:Ningauble">talk</a>) 19:29, 28 February 2014 (UTC)

<dl><dd>Sitting on the board of a group (which prominent people are asked to do all the time) does not make him a Humanist (or 'humanist' if you prefer). So it remains the case that he never self identified. I don't want to have an argument about the evolution of the Humanism, I'm perfectly happy with the facts about the FHS and Einstein's sitting on the board, and that they may have a place in the article, it's just that they don't make Einstein a Humanist. And my point about his views not being in accord with Humanism are the clincher.

<dd>Despite the observations you make against taking much of the evidence of his humanism which has been presented as credible enough for you, because perhaps he never said such words as "I am a Humanist", I would point out that many who have been regarded and very <i>rightly</i> regarded as "<a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Saints" title="Saints">saints</a>" and "<a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Heroes" title="Heroes">heroes</a>" or "great philosophers" by many have never "self-identified" themselves as such, and many who would like to "self-designate" themselves as such clearly have done little or nothing to deserve such designations by the wise. Others might quite generally be recognized by many as "cowards" and "villains" or "asinine fools" or properly labelled with even cruder terms of vulgar distinction, which I will decline to specify at this point, and yet never "self-identify" by such terms, and often even seek to rebuke and severely punish those who would use them in <i>any</i> ways, while the most courageous of heroes and saints often patiently accept even the vilest of designations with a profound good humor and remain of general good will to all. <b>Many throughout the ages, attempting to mark others in various ways, good or bad, or to deny many of the marks and qualities of others, mark themselves in far more ways than they know, as extreme fools and hypocrites. Some of the greatest of human beings and saints willingly play many of the roles of "Fool" — but none but the most foolish and vile willfully play the role of hypocrite, and all the wise seek to be fair with others, to the extent they can properly be so, without being even more unfair to others.</b></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<dl><dd>My 'fear' is that the words 'was a humanist' don't express the truth. And my concern is that the facts being distorted (however slightly) is an attempt to add credibility to Humanism by humanists. Einstein, whose religious views were complex and ill defined, is regarded as one of the world's foremost geniuses, and therefore he's clearly a 'prize scalp' for any group or ideology that can associate their views with his. I don't have any gripe with Humanism per se, and I'm happy (since it's true) for his humanist sympathies to have their due weight in any relevant article. It's just that this slight distortion seems to me to be a deliberate case of shenanigans :).

<dd>I would like to point out that this entire section began in <b>3 October 2012</b>, after an anon IP <a class="external text" href="https://en.wikiquote.org/w/index.php?title=Albert_Einstein&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=1489318">simply added humanist rather crudely to the intro</a>, so that it read "one of the most influential scientists and humanists of all time" — and I soon after, revised this rather sloppy addition as improper, and noted that with my first comments above. The addition of <a class="mw-redirect" href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Humanist" title="Humanist">Humanist</a> itself remained a relatively uncontroversial one for some time, until these recent comments. I do not believe it excessive or controversial at all to make note that he was a humanist any more than it would be to note the Pope is a Christian — the stances and activities throughout their lives testify to the validity of such assertions. Though he certainly favored forms of democratic socialism, he was not so active as socialist as he was a humanist and as a pacifist, though certainly not so totally passive as some might have wished, as his influence and that of <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Le%C3%B3_Szil%C3%A1rd" title="Leó Szilárd">Leó Szilárd</a>, who was another humanistic pacifist, helped initiate the <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan_Project" title="w:Manhattan Project">Manhattan Project</a>, out of fear of <a class="mw-redirect" href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Nazi" title="Nazi">Nazi</a> Germany developing such weapons. <b>What people CAN mean by many words can and DOES vary widely — and some of us have been acutely aware of that since infancy, but I again assert, to say that Einstein was a humanist is pretty much what many would call a "no-brainer" from my perspectives</b> — and despite grammatical complications in word usage, I defer to common connotations, and do not mean to imply that one makes it without a brain, but that even most of those of relatively little knowledge can recognize it, with little more difficulty than the most well informed would.  ~ <font style="color:white;background:silver">♞<a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/User:Kalki/Kalkiswords" title="User:Kalki/Kalkiswords">☤</a><a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/User:Kalki/Magic" title="User:Kalki/Magic">☮</a>♌<a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/User:Kalki" title="User:Kalki">Kalki</a>·<a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/User_talk:Kalki" title="User talk:Kalki">†</a>·<a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/User:Kalki/index" title="User:Kalki/index">⚓</a>⊙<a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/User:Kalki/Chronology" title="User:Kalki/Chronology">☳</a><a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/User:Kalki/Vox_Box" title="User:Kalki/Vox Box">☶</a>⚡</font> 20:09, 2 March 2014 (UTC) + tweaks
<dl><dd>I don't agree with any wording anywhere that says 'was a humanist' unless we can find a reliable source that says so, for the reasons stated above, i.e. that it's not strictly true and quite possibly an attempt to gain credibility. I'm perfectly happy for any discussion about sympathies/parallels in views, support of groups etc to have their proper and due weight. This I think is fair and balanced. I'd be perfectly happy with a wording like 'Although he never self-identified as a humanist, he did etc etc'. This seems to me to be accurate, fair and non-contentious. I've now had time to read more about Humanism, and it has evolved quite significantly from Einstein's day (when it was headed by a Unitarian) to the present day when it's explicitly areligious, which I think only confirms my earlier remark about it having changed and therefore the assertion being even more misleading. And I'm sorry to descend to name calling, Kalki, but your hand waving about the conclusion being obvious only adds weight to the assertion being new research. <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/User:HPotato" title="User:HPotato">HPotato</a> (<a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/User_talk:HPotato" title="User talk:HPotato">talk</a>) 20:31, 2 March 2014 (UTC)
<dl><dd>Though I can appreciate some of your perspectives, I really perceive your logic to be deficient and flawed in more ways than I care to immediately specify.

<p><b>This was the Quote of the Day for today</b>, which I actually decided to use and illustrate as I did, based partly on some of the discussions here, was one which I long admired by a teacher of a mystic philosopher I have long admired — <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Simone_Weil" title="Simone Weil">Simone Weil</a>, who in turn inspired a far more widely appreciated <a class="mw-redirect" href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Absurdist" title="Absurdist">absurdist</a> philosopher I have long admired, <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Albert_Camus" title="Albert Camus">Albert Camus</a>. My esteem for some of what they said as well as MANY other philosophers, including <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Ludwig_Wittgenstein" title="Ludwig Wittgenstein">Ludwig Wittgenstein</a>, who was also a modern philosopher who I was profoundly inspired by, almost certainly dates to when I was 5 or 6 years old, but it was later when I was at least 7 or nearly 8 when much more of their thought patterns and of their meanings became more clear to me. Certainly, by the time I was 10, I was quite enamored of many of the insights of absurdism, which Camus developed, and more general forms of <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Existentialism" title="Existentialism">Existentialism</a> which have been developed by many figures, perhaps most notably <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/S%C3%B8ren_Kierkegaard" title="Søren Kierkegaard">Søren Kierkegaard</a>. I also developed and retain a high regard for MANY other modern and ancient philosophers, even many of those relatively obscure to most; so even this brief summary indicates I have definitely had rather unusual perspectives from a relatively early age. 
</p><p>That quote INDICATES much about the capacities and limitations of human thought in MANY realms of exploration and investigation, and the often bewildering mass of designations which can develop — and it often takes rigorous <a class="mw-redirect" href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Semiotic" title="Semiotic">semiotic</a> and rational analysis to unravel, and clarify, and where this is possible at all, one can usually do it far better with a broad range of cultural, social, sociological and psychological insights that ever welcome expansion, than from narrow, very fixed, limited and rigid stand points.
</p><p>ONE great quotation I have long admired, which was among the <i>many</i> others I considered for the day, was one by <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Alexander_Graham_Bell" title="Alexander Graham Bell">Alexander Graham Bell</a>: "<b>Concentrate all your thoughts upon the work at hand. The sun's rays do not burn until brought to a focus.</b>"
</p><p>One thing I would like to emphasize which goes unstated or ignored or overlooked in this great statement, is that one must often have a broad range of knowledge and experience and awareness and appreciation of diverse forms of context, to bring things into intense focus — and <b>the broader and more expansive the ranges or "lens" of one's awareness, the more powerful the "energies" and "thoughts" which one can focus.</b>
</p><p><b>I appreciate MUCH of the worth and limitations of MANY diverse assessments of BOTH <a class="mw-redirect" href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Monistic" title="Monistic">monistic</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Pluralistic" title="Pluralistic">pluralistic</a> tendencies in human thought, and recognize that they can produce diverse and even unique forms of mystical, ethical and rationalist systems.</b>
</p><p>As a person inclined to various forms of thought and exploration which might be labeled types of "absurdist universalist mysticism", (or many other such evocative terms which I KNOW can be puzzling to others, and can eagerly accept many that are even rather silly, as an antidote to many forms of silly pretentions), I accept and sometimes advocate a rather diverse "polyphonic" reverence for many aspects of the "Omnipresent Monad" by many diverse names, and notions.
</p><p>I recognize MANY forms of extremely absurd and yet extremely strong perceptions, in many of the political, religious, social an spiritual traditions many people embrace, as well as the extremely wise, but sometimes relatively fragile or vulnerable ones, <b>I am quite aware there are MANY ways to characterize and label human attitudes and assertions which are not apparently consistent and even contradictory — including MANY which set up DEFICIENT, FLAWED, or FALSE dichotomies, which can lead to even further false assumptions.</b> As someone who has personally long recognized MANY forms of the virtues and values of MANY forms of philosophy, spirituality and religions, including systems of humanism, as well as more traditional systems of rational, ethical or mystical faiths and practices, I realized very young that there ARE limits on the appreciations of many diverse ways which others can have, and there are many people who one could call humanists, or by any of the more commonly recognized traditions of social, religious, political or economic philosophy who would insist that many forms of rational reconciliation or even dialogue with people of other traditions is <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Anathema" title="Anathema">anathema</a> to various notions of rational, ethical, or mystical integrity. 
</p><p>I am such a <a class="mw-disambig" href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Fool" title="Fool">fool</a>, as has recognized that there is a VITAL NEED to see BEYOND all our designations and even in childhood recognized many rational, ethical and mystical methods and systems which were beneficial to such aims, and that these existed largely independent of the labels by which people sought to distinguish and differentiate themselves and many of their particular ways from others. Early on, even by the age of 5 or 6, I greatly appreciated and was VERY impressed by the thoughts and ideas of <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/G._I._Gurdjieff" title="G. I. Gurdjieff">G. I. Gurdjieff</a>, among many others, and certain ideas and attitudes of the <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Quakers" title="Quakers">Quakers</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Unitarians" title="Unitarians">Unitarians</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Universalists" title="Universalists">Universalists</a>, and proponents of <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Vedanta" title="Vedanta">Vedanta</a> <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Monism" title="Monism">monism</a>.
</p><p><b>I was not actually "trained" to explore philosophies or believe as I did by any adults seeking to indoctrinate me in any particular system of philosophy, science or spirituality — I often amazed them with the extent of my knowledge and explorations, and though some helped and hindered me in various ways, I was largely self-driven in my explorations, and I actively avoided many forms of "training" I considered merely "taming" and which I realized often consisted primarily of EXCLUDING many forms of thought and ideas.</b> I saw that MANY in various traditions were TRAINED to reject MUCH that was plainly GOOD and WORTHY in others ways, primarily because it was not what they were <i>taught</i>, and to accept MUCH that was vile and even evil, because it was taught as the "norm" or even the "ideal" — and the examples of this I or nearly anyone else can give are numerous. <b>Having already made quite extensive comments, I will simply end by saying, in summary — I believe, like many others, and unlike many others, that Mystical, Ethical and Rational views can all be reconciled, in many diverse and beautiful ways, and am often interested in finding ways to do so... and among these are <i>many</i> forms of <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Humanism" title="Humanism">humanism</a>, many forms of <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Mysticism" title="Mysticism">mysticism</a> and many systems of <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Ethics" title="Ethics">ethics</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Rationality" title="Rationality">rationality</a> which can share much in common, yet harmoniously differ in regard to many diverse aspects of belief. <i>So it goes</i>… </b>  ~ <font style="color:white;background:silver">♞<a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/User:Kalki/Kalkiswords" title="User:Kalki/Kalkiswords">☤</a><a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/User:Kalki/Magic" title="User:Kalki/Magic">☮</a>♌<a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/User:Kalki" title="User:Kalki">Kalki</a>·<a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/User_talk:Kalki" title="User talk:Kalki">†</a>·<a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/User:Kalki/index" title="User:Kalki/index">⚓</a>⊙<a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/User:Kalki/Chronology" title="User:Kalki/Chronology">☳</a><a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/User:Kalki/Vox_Box" title="User:Kalki/Vox Box">☶</a>⚡</font> 19:44, 3 March 2014 (UTC) + tweaks

<dl><dd>I appreciate your generosity in sharing your insights with me, Kalki, and your phrase 'narrow, very fixed, limited and rigid stand points.' is entirely justified since I did study Maths. And I accept from your heartfelt use of the term 'mystical' that you are not a damnable atheistic humanist engaged in surrilous POV pushing. That said, except by a vague reference to semiotic analysis, you haven't actually answered the question. :) <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/User:HPotato" title="User:HPotato">HPotato</a> (<a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/User_talk:HPotato" title="User talk:HPotato">talk</a>) 20:07, 3 March 2014 (UTC)
<dl><dd>There was a slight edit conflict, and I had actually realized there were many specifications in my thoughts which I had not elaborated upon in the typing, in my rush to finish up, and had already prepared to tweak the above statements as I do now. But to summarize again, though many would seek to insist otherwise, I perceive no innate conflict in the ethics of humanism and many diverse forms of mysticism, and as someone with "universalist" perspectives which I know many others cannot share, believe there can be <i>many</i> worthy forms of reconciliation of sciences with religions and even many forms of atheism and agnosticism with many forms of theism. <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Simone_Weil" title="Simone Weil">Simone Weil</a>, made quite significant statements on this subject, as did her teacher <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/%C3%89mile_Chartier" title="Émile Chartier">Émile Chartier</a> — and many others. <i><a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Blessings" title="Blessings">Blessings</a></i> ~ <font style="color:white;background:silver">♞<a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/User:Kalki/Kalkiswords" title="User:Kalki/Kalkiswords">☤</a><a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/User:Kalki/Magic" title="User:Kalki/Magic">☮</a>♌<a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/User:Kalki" title="User:Kalki">Kalki</a>·<a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/User_talk:Kalki" title="User talk:Kalki">†</a>·<a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/User:Kalki/index" title="User:Kalki/index">⚓</a>⊙<a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/User:Kalki/Chronology" title="User:Kalki/Chronology">☳</a><a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/User:Kalki/Vox_Box" title="User:Kalki/Vox Box">☶</a>⚡</font> 20:20, 3 March 2014 (UTC) + tweaks
<dl><dd>This is all fine, but to be <i>Mathematical</i> about this, all of the Humanist stuff is fine, and just etc, but Daniel's comments re humanist quotes still don't cut it, and 'humanist' in the lede is not justified, on prominence as well as accuracy, so without some movement from <i>you</i>, Kalki (I've conceded it's fine to stay in 'List of humanists', I think we should go to arbitration.

<dl><dd>It is quite common, in our brief intros to state some ethnic info and religious or philosophical affiliations, though certainly not required. So far, humanism has been in the intro since 3 October 2012, when posted by an anon IP, in a way I soon amended, but saw no reason to remove, and there had been little dispute on the matter, despite it being one of our most visited and edited articles, until you posted objections to it here, and at the Village Pump, and received responses thus far from me and Ningauble, who both seem to favor its retention, as appropriate, and from DanielTom, who has wavered, and I am not sure what he favors at this point. I don't really perceive this as a crisis requiring arbitration. ~ <font style="color:white;background:silver">♞<a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/User:Kalki/Kalkiswords" title="User:Kalki/Kalkiswords">☤</a><a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/User:Kalki/Magic" title="User:Kalki/Magic">☮</a>♌<a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/User:Kalki" title="User:Kalki">Kalki</a>·<a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/User_talk:Kalki" title="User talk:Kalki">†</a>·<a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/User:Kalki/index" title="User:Kalki/index">⚓</a>⊙<a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/User:Kalki/Chronology" title="User:Kalki/Chronology">☳</a><a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/User:Kalki/Vox_Box" title="User:Kalki/Vox Box">☶</a>⚡</font> 23:01, 3 March 2014 (UTC)
<dl><dd>Einstein believed in Spinoza's God. Is this incompatible with humanism? Depends on the definition. Cowardly modern atheists seem to have hijacked the word to describe themselves (calling yourself a "humanist" sounds better than "atheist", at least in the USA), so it ("humanism") is now viewed by many as a synonym for atheism. This is unfortunate, but true nonetheless for many modern readers, and I think we need to be sensible to this. Besides, I don't think it is our business to ascribe ideological positions to others based on our own interpretations of their sayings. I am reminded of the French rhetorical author whose opponents insisted was actually a realist based on his writings, though he himself resisted such labels. I do think that a third (maybe <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/User:BD2412" title="User:BD2412">a fourth</a>) voice would be helpful to settle this issue. My position hasn't "wavered", Kalki, I still believe that we should follow WP's lede – include "physicist", but leave out other more controversial (and less attested to) labels. I do share the concern that calling Einstein a "humanist" <i>today</i> could be potentially deceiving. "Jewish humanist" even more so. ~ <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/User:DanielTom" title="User:DanielTom">DanielTom</a> (<a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/User_talk:DanielTom" title="User talk:DanielTom">talk</a>) 23:26, 3 March 2014 (UTC)
<dl><dd>My general preference is to have our ledes mirror, in an abbreviated manner, Wikipedia's ledes.

<dl><dd>I'm also happy, since it's descending to nit-picking, not to argue with 'was a humanist' in the body, as long as the paragraph is suitably accurate otherwise. I hope this meets with your approval, Kalki :) <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/User:HPotato" title="User:HPotato">HPotato</a> (<a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/User_talk:HPotato" title="User talk:HPotato">talk</a>) 09:32, 4 March 2014 (UTC)
<dl><dd>To DanielTom‎: I concede I was somewhat sloppy in my earlier expression yesterday, and should have been more cautious in the wording of my statement, and only said "<i>seems</i> to have wavered" because, given your assertions, <i>I</i> was not actually sure what your positions were at some points, and thus not sure how much they might have changed, or <i>not</i>. As to your assertion that calling Einstein a "Jewish humanist" "could be potentially deceiving" I can concede that as well, because as a rather acutely observant absurdist, I KNOW that <b>ALL <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Words" title="Words">words</a> are "potentially deceiving" in many diverse ways.</b> I am usually very cautious in using words, to the extent I can be, and can assert that taking ANY words AS IF they were absolutely reliable means of conveying some range of meaning or truth and ONLY that, without any taint of error, or the means for actual and potential false associations, is extremely deceiving. All words are INDICATIONS, and usually carry MANY forms of subtle or overtly manifest connotations and associations and meanings beyond the ranges of their primary intended meanings. All that being said, even if things do eventually go against retaining the current wording, <b>I still do not find the simple designation of Einstein as a "Jewish humanist" as something either controversial or excessive</b>, and certainly not something <i>false</i>, save to those relative few who wrongly <i>equate</i> humanism with atheism, rather than with <i><a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Reason" title="Reason">reasonableness</a></i> about a <i>broad</i> range of <i><a class="mw-redirect" href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Beliefs" title="Beliefs">beliefs</a></i> and <i>differences</i> of <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Thought" title="Thought">thought</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Opinions" title="Opinions">opinions</a> among human beings (and not only regarding disputes about theologies and types of atheism or agnosticism). <b>I certainly believe it <i>should</i> stay, but am not all that <i>concerned</i> about whether it stays or not.</b> I do tend to believe that <b>if people have so narrow and limited an awareness as to believe or insist that "humanist" simply equates to "athiest" they should definitely be disabused of such ignorance and confusion, as swiftly as possible.</b> The designation has existed on a very well visited page for well over a year, and I would not personally remove it, but if enough people, who for some reason find the relatively simple and honest statement so "controversial" as to decide to remove it, do so, I am certainly not going to get into an edit war about so relatively minor a matter. There are certainly many other issues here which concern me far more. To close, I would simply state my firm <i><b>belief</b></i> that <b>whatever anyone's particular notions about the <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Worth" title="Worth">worth</a>, or lack of it, related to ANY of the quite <i>various</i> notions of <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/God" title="God">God</a> or <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Reality" title="Reality">Reality</a>, it is a person's forms and levels of <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Honesty" title="Honesty">Honesty</a>, <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Compassion" title="Compassion">Compassion</a>, <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Humility" title="Humility">Humility</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Courage" title="Courage">Courage</a> which ultimately matter most in determining their character and their fortunes — and these are certainly neither exclusive to any particular traditions of faith or reason, NOR guaranteed by them — nor by any labels that might be applied or misapplied to them.</b> <i><a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Dharma" title="Dharma">So</a> <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Awareness" title="Awareness">it</a> <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Eternity" title="Eternity">goes</a></i>… <big> <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Monism" title="Monism">⨀</a><a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Necessity" title="Necessity">∴</a><a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Life" title="Life">☥</a><a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Peace" title="Peace">☮</a><a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Love" title="Love">♥</a><a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Understanding" title="Understanding">∵</a> … <i><a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Blessings" title="Blessings">Blessings</a></i>. </big> ~ <font style="color:white;background:silver">♞<a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/User:Kalki/Kalkiswords" title="User:Kalki/Kalkiswords">☤</a><a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/User:Kalki/Magic" title="User:Kalki/Magic">☮</a>♌<a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/User:Kalki" title="User:Kalki">Kalki</a>·<a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/User_talk:Kalki" title="User talk:Kalki">†</a>·<a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/User:Kalki/index" title="User:Kalki/index">⚓</a>⊙<a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/User:Kalki/Chronology" title="User:Kalki/Chronology">☳</a><a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/User:Kalki/Vox_Box" title="User:Kalki/Vox Box">☶</a>⚡</font> 15:44, 4 March 2014 (UTC) + tweaks</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<dd>He's notable as a scientist mainly. And regardless of his many spiritual remarks, he's very well known for 'God doesn't play dice.' Which really clashes with Humanism (at least my simplistic view of it). As to 'Jewish' - he's only really known for that ethnically as far as I can tell (I'm not really in any position to judge how Judaism informs his quotes). Perhaps we can have editors with knowledge in this area comment? Although just on aesthetics alone, it was starting to look clumsy I thought. And as Daniel said, 'Jewish humanist' isn't really a widely understood designation. We have (or can have) both the fact that he was Jewish in the body, ditto humanist. If they're appropriate combined as 'Jewish humanist', can't we have that in the body? Can you make a case for it in the lede? Can you make a case (firstly in the body) that it informs his quotes in any way? <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/User:HPotato" title="User:HPotato">HPotato</a> (<a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/User_talk:HPotato" title="User talk:HPotato">talk</a>) 08:03, 6 March 2014 (UTC)

<dd>At first glance, I like the substance of what you've said above, although I don't believe it belongs in the lede. It would make a great summary somewhere in the body though.

<dl><dd>Or a second paragraph in the lede, since there isn't really a body as such. Still too specific/dubious for the first sentence though, I think. That's my 2p <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/User:HPotato" title="User:HPotato">HPotato</a> (<a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/User_talk:HPotato" title="User talk:HPotato">talk</a>) 08:15, 6 March 2014 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd>
<dd>In "God doesn't play dice", <i>God</i> is being used as a metaphor for the <i>laws of nature</i>. You can't infer from that alone that Einstein believed in God, any more than you could infer that Stephen Hawking believes in God just because he says "God not only plays dice, He also sometimes throws the dice where they cannot be seen." (And Hawking is an atheist.) ~ <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/User:DanielTom" title="User:DanielTom">DanielTom</a> (<a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/User_talk:DanielTom" title="User talk:DanielTom">talk</a>) 08:48, 6 March 2014 (UTC)

<dl><dd><blockquote><p>Ist wohl nicht verwunderlich, dass gerade er mir half, mich unter den «objektiven» Naturwissenschaftern nicht mehr wie auf eine eisige Mondlandschaft verschlagen zu fühlen. Um mich herum stürmte die moderne Physik vorwärts – hier allein gab es «objektive Wahrheit», die mir unglücklicherweise nichts bedeutete, und alles Menschliche würde womöglich bald in naturwissenschaftlichen Ausdrücken beschrieben werden können. Da fragte ich Einstein einmal: «Ja, glauben Sie denn, dass sich einfach alles auf naturwissenschaftliche Weise wird abbilden lassen können?!» «Ja», meinte er, «das ist denkbar, aber es hätte doch keinen Sinn. Es wäre eine Abbildung mit inadäquaten Mitteln, so als ob man eine Beethoven-Symphonie als Luftdruckkurve darstellte.» Das war tröstlich.</p></blockquote></dd></dl>
<dl><dd>Here's an English translation from <i>Einstein: The Life and Times</i>, by Ronald Clark, <a class="external text" href="http://books.google.com/books?id=gchgl_XLqI0C&amp;pg=PT284&amp;dq=%22probably+not+surprising%22" rel="nofollow">p. 243</a>:</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><blockquote><p>It is probably not surprising that it was he who helped me to be an objective scientist, and to avoid feeling that the whole thing was impersonal. Modern physics left me standing. Here was only objective truth, which unhappily meant nothing to me, and perhaps the possibility that in the future everything would be expressed scientifically. So I asked Einstein one day, "Do you believe that absolutely everything can be expressed scientifically?" "Yes," he replied, "it would be possible, but it would make no sense. It would be description without meaning—as if you described a Beethoven symphony as a variation of wave pressure." This was a great solace to me.</p></blockquote></dd></dl>

<dl><dd><dl><dd>I have to disagree that <i>"Es wäre eine Abbildung mit inadäquaten Mitteln"</i> can be fairly translated as <i>"It would be description without meaning"</i>.

<dl><dd>Yeah, seems to be going viral.  You can even get it on a t-shirt.  I've looked through google scholar and books and my conclusion is that it's a bogus quote; the only instances are recent, and attribute it to Anonymous.

<dd>Another one is "Dancers are the athletes of God."  I didn't look into it as thoroughly, but I'd bet it's of a piece.

<p>"No problem can be solved by the same KIND OF THINKING that created it." is the correct unadulterated quote from Albert Einstein The quote is about the null result of the Michaelson-Moreley experiment.
</p><p>'No problem' (such as the null result of the Michaelson-Moreley experiment) 'can be solved' (understood) 'by the same' (re-application of the principles) 'kind of thinking that created it'.  In this context, the quote makes perfect sense, but changing "kind of thinking" to "level of consciousness" changes the meaning entirely, or at best makes the original meaning close to incomprehensible.
</p><p>I've read a lot of Albert Einstiein's original writings on a lot of different subjects over a lifetime, much of it in his original German.  I'm sure I never saw him use the German equivalent of: "level of consciousness" in any context, on any subject.

<p>I question that all of the claimed quotes here are in English. I do not know how fluent A.E. was in English, but I know that many of his his letters (or his speaking with native Germans) were in German. That being the case, this should make clear the FACT that a particular "quote" as provided here is a translation. (Which is done in some cases, but needs to be done exhaustively). Its also likely that during his Princeton and later years, some or most of what he said WAS in English, but I don't know that. This page confuses what exactly Einstein said with various translators' versions and with various alternative quotes. There is what he said, then there are people's memory of that (if it isn't recorded explicitly), then there are the various translations (and unfortunately interpretations) of his comments. The difference should be kept clear. It isn't that hard, is it, to provide the original (Deutsch) is it? So, why not do it?<a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/173.189.79.42" title="Special:Contributions/173.189.79.42">173.189.79.42</a> 13:01, 13 May 2015 (UTC)

<p>Hi all, I've seen this attributed to Einstein, it's not here but it's all over the web; "The definition of genius is taking the complex and making it simple". So I submit it to wikipedia's collective wisdom and powers of checking. Sounds to me like paraphrasing other stuff, such as the wrongly attributed "Any intelligent fool can make things bigger, more complex, and more violent. It takes a touch of genius—and a lot of courage to move in the opposite direction." --<a class="new" href="https://en.wikiquote.org/w/index.php?title=User:Jrob_kiwi&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="User:Jrob kiwi (page does not exist)">Jrob kiwi</a> (<a class="new" href="https://en.wikiquote.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Jrob_kiwi&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="User talk:Jrob kiwi (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 10:22, 18 February 2019 (UTC)
