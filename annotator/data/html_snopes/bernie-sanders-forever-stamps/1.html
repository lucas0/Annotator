  WASHINGTON- In a stunning and controversial departure from standard practice dating back over two hundred years, the United States Postal Service has issued a Forever Stamp endorsing the 2020 presidential candidacy of Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.</p>
<p style="color: black;">Adorned with the words “BERNIE 2020” the jumbo-sized stamp depicts the senator delivering a campaign speech amidst a colorful backdrop of American flags.</p>
<p style="color: black;">Or so is the illusion being created courtesy of a mischievously designed envelope that’s been showing up in thousands of mailboxes nationwide since its release just a few days ago, both fooling and delighting its recipients. (<a href="http://thecomicnews.com/store/envelopes/bernie/">View Bernie Sanders Envelope</a>)</p>
<p style="color: black;">The deception is accomplished by means of incorporating a USPS Forever Stamp (a flag) into the design printed in the upper-right corner of the envelope. When the Forever Stamp is affixed in its designated place, the Bernie Sanders ‘stamp’ image has been completed.</p>
<p style="color: black;">The ready-for-mailing envelope comes with a “Red, White, and Blue” Forever Stamp and requires no additional postage to be mailed first class anywhere in the U.S. (up to one ounce, like all Forever Stamps).</p>
<p style="color: black;">A six-pack of the envelopes and stamps sells for $12.</p>
