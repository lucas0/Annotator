<h3>Pre-Social Security Period</h3>
<p><font color="#003399" size="5">Traditional Sources of Economic 
              Security</font></p>
<p>All peoples throughout all of human history have faced the uncertainties 
              brought on by unemployment, illness, disability, death and old age. 
              In the realm of economics, these inevitable facets of life are said 
              to be threats to one's <a name="I1"></a><i> economic security</i>.</p>
<p>For the ancient Greeks economic security took the form of amphorae 
              of olive oil. Olive oil was very nutritious and could be stored 
              for relatively long periods. To provide for themselves in times 
              of need the Greeks stockpiled olive oil and this was their form 
              of economic security.</p>
<p>In medieval Europe, the feudal system was the basis of economic 
              security, with the feudal lord responsible for the economic survival 
              of the serfs working on the estate. The feudal lord had economic 
              security as long as there was a steady supply of serfs to work the 
              estate, and the serfs had economic security only so long as they 
              were fit enough to provide their labor. During the Middle Ages the 
              idea of charity as a formal economic arrangement also appeared for 
              the first time.</p>
<p>Family members and relatives have always felt some degree of responsibility 
              to one another, and to the extent that the family had resources 
              to draw upon, this was often a source of economic security, especially 
              for the aged or infirm. And land itself was an important form of 
              economic security for those who owned it or who lived on farms.</p>
<p>These then are the traditional sources of economic security: assets; 
              labor; family; and charity.</p>
<p>Â </p>
<p><font color="#003399" size="5">The Rise of Formal Systems of Economic 
              Security</font></p>
<p>As societies grew in economic and social complexity, and as isolated 
              farms gave way to cities and villages, Europe witnessed the development 
              of formal organizations of various types that sought to protect 
              the economic security of their members. Probably the earliest of 
              these organizations were <i>guilds</i> formed during the Middle 
              Ages by merchants or craftsmen. Individuals who had a common trade 
              or business banded together into mutual aid societies, or guilds. 
              These guilds regulated production and employment and they also provided 
              a range of benefits to their members including financial help in 
              times of poverty or illness and contributions to help defray the 
              expenses when a member died.</p>
<p>Out of the tradition of the guilds emerged the<i> friendly societies. 
              </i>These organizations began appearing in England in the 16th century. 
              Again organized around a common trade or business, the friendly 
              societies would evolve into what we now call <i>fraternal organizations 
              </i>and were the forerunners of modern trade unions.</p>
<p>In addition to the types of economic security provided by the guilds, 
              the fraternal organizations and some trade unions would begin the 
              practice of providing actuarially-based life insurance to their 
              members. The friendly societies and the fraternal organizations 
              would grow dramatically following the Industrial Revolution. By 
              the beginning of the 19th century one of out every nine Englishmen 
              belonged to one of these organizations.</p>
<p>Among early U.S. fraternal organizations that we are familiar with 
              even into the present day were: the Freemasons (which came to America 
              in 1730); the Odd Fellows (1819); Benevolent and Protective Order 
              of Elks (1868); Loyal Order of Moose (1888); and the Fraternal Order 
              of Eagles (1898).</p>
<p><br/>
<font color="#003399" size="5">The English "Poor Laws"</font></p>
<p>As the state began to assume responsibility for economic security, 
              the English began the development of a series of "Poor Laws" 
              adopted to provide help to the poor, as the problem of economic 
              security was seen primarily as a problem afflicting the poor.</p>
<p>The English Poor Law of 1601 was the first systematic codification 
              of English ideas about the responsibility of the state to provide 
              for the welfare of its citizens. It provided for taxation to fund 
              relief activities; it distinguished between the "deserving" 
              and the "undeserving" poor; relief was local and community 
              controlled; and almshouses were eventually established to house 
              those on relief. The law was at once both generous and harsh. Generous 
              in that it acknowledged the government's duty to provide for the 
              welfare of the poor, but harsh in that it viewed the poor as highly 
              undesirable characters and treated them accordingly.</p>
<p>There were a series of changes and "reforms" of the "Poor 
              Laws" over the years, but this essential structure was the 
              tradition the pilgrims brought with them when they journeyed to 
              the New World.</p>
<p><br/>
<font color="#003399" size="5">Economic Security in America</font></p>
<p>When the English-speaking colonists arrived in the New World they 
              brought with them the ideas and customs they knew in England, including 
              the "Poor Laws." The first colonial poor laws were fashioned 
              after those of the Poor Law of 1601. They featured local taxation 
              to support the destitute; they discriminated between the "worthy" 
              and the "unworthy" poor; and all relief was a local responsibility. 
              No public institutions for the poor or standardized eligibility 
              criteria would exist for nearly a century. It was up to local town 
              elders to decide who was worthy of support and how that support 
              would be provided.</p>
<p>As colonial America grew more complex, diverse and mobile, the 
              localized systems of poor relief were strained. The result was some 
              limited movement to state financing and the creation of almshouses 
              and poorhouses to "contain" the problem. For much of the 
              18th and 19th centuries most poverty relief was provided in the 
              almshouses and poorhouses. Relief was made as unpleasant as possible 
              in order to "discourage" dependency. Those receiving relief 
              could lose their personal property, the right to vote, the right 
              to move, and in some cases were required to wear a large "P" 
              on their clothing to announce their status.</p>
<p>Support outside the institutions was called "outdoor relief" 
              and was looked upon with distrust by most citizens. It was felt 
              that "outdoor relief" made things too easy on the poor 
              who should be discouraged from the habit of poverty in every way 
              possible. Nevertheless, since it was expensive to build and <a href="poorhse.html">operate 
              the poorhouses</a>, and since it was relatively easy to dispense 
              cash or in-kind support, some outdoor relief did emerge. Even so, 
              prevailing American attitudes toward poverty relief were always 
              skeptical and the role of government was kept to the minimum. So 
              much so that by as late as 1915 at most only 25% of the money spent 
              on outdoor relief was from public funds.</p>

<p>Although the need for economic security affects all ages and classes 
              of society, one particularly acute aspect of this need is the problem 
              of old age and the possibility of retirement after a long life of 
              labor. Retirement, a feature of life we now take so much for granted, 
              was not always readily available, and it was a struggle to develop 
              adequate systems of retirement.</p>
<p>One of the first people to propose a scheme for retirement security 
              that is recognizable as a forerunner of modern social insurance 
              was Revolutionary War figure Thomas Paine. His last great pamphlet, 
              published in the winter of 1795, was a controversial call for the 
              establishment of a public system of economic security for the new 
              nation. Entitled, <a href="tpaine3.html"><i>Agrarian Justice</i></a>, 
              it called for the creation of a system whereby those inheriting 
              property would pay a 10% inheritance tax to create a special fund 
              out of which a one-time stipend of 15 pounds sterling would be paid 
              to each citizen upon attaining age 21, to give them a start in life, 
              and annual benefits of 10 pounds sterling to be paid to every person 
              age 50 and older, to guard against poverty in old-age.</p>

<font color="#003399" size="5">Civil War Pensions: America's First 
              "Social Security" Program</font></p>
<p>Although Social Security did not really arrive in America until 
              1935, there was one important precursor, that offered something 
              we could recognize as a social security program, to one special 
              segment of the American population. Following the Civil War, there 
              were hundreds of thousands of widows and orphans, and hundreds of 
              thousands of disabled veterans. In fact, immediately following the 
              Civil War a much higher proportion of the population was disabled 
              or survivors of deceased breadwinners than at any time in America's 
              history. This led to the development of a generous pension program, 
              with interesting similarities to later developments in Social Security. 
              (The first national pension program for soldiers was actually passed 
              in early 1776, prior even to the signing of the Declaration of Independence. 
              Throughout America's ante-bellum period pensions of limited types 
              were paid to veterans of America's various wars. But it was with 
              the creation of Civil War pensions that a full-fledged pension system 
              developed in America for the first time.)</p>
<p>The Civil War Pension program began shortly after the start of 
              the War, with the first legislation in 1862 providing for benefits 
              linked to disabilities "incurred as a direct consequence of 
              . . .military duty." Widows and orphans could receive pensions 
              equal in amount to that which would have been payable to their deceased 
              solider if he had been disabled. In 1890 the link with service-connected 
              disability was broken, and any disabled Civil War veteran qualified 
              for benefits. In 1906, old-age was made a sufficient qualification 
              for benefits. So that by 1910, Civil War veterans and their survivors 
              enjoyed a program of disability, survivors and old-age benefits 
              similar in some ways to the later Social Security programs. By 1910, 
              over 90% of the remaining Civil War veterans were receiving benefits 
              under this program, although they constituted barely .6% of the 
              total U.S. population of that era. Civil War pensions were also 
              an asset that attracted young wives to elderly veterans whose pensions 
              they could inherit as the widow of a war veteran. Indeed, there 
              were still surviving widows of Civil War veterans receiving Civil 
              War pensions as late as 1999!</p>
<p>In the aggregate, military pensions were an important source of 
              economic security in the early years of the nation. In 1893, for 
              example, the $165 million spent on military pensions was the largest 
              single expenditure ever made by the federal government. In 1894 
              military pensions accounted for 37% of the entire federal budget. 
              (<a href="puck.html">The Civil War pension system was not without 
              its critics</a>.)</p>
<p>But these figures based on the federal budget exaggerate the role 
              of military pensions in providing overall economic security since 
              the federal government's share of the economy was much smaller in 
              earlier times. Also, there were features of the system which meant 
              that many veterans did not receive any benefits. For example, former 
              Confederate soldiers and their families were barred from receiving 
              Civil War pensions. So in 1910 the per capita average military pension 
              expenditure for residents of Ohio was $3.36 and for Indiana it was 
              $3.90. By contrast, the per capita average for the Southern states 
              was less than 50 cents (it was 17 cents in South Carolina).</p>
<p>Despite the fact that America had a "social security" 
              program in the form of Civil War pensions since 1862, this precedent 
              did not extend itself to the general society. The expansion of these 
              types of benefit programs to the general population, under Social 
              Security, would have to await additional social and historical developments.</p>
<p><br/>
<font color="#003399" size="5">The Company Pension</font></p>
<p>Prior to the rise of company pension plans, paternalistic companies 
              sometimes "graduated" older workers to token jobs at reduced 
              pay. A few paid some form of retirement stipendâbut only if the 
              company was so inclined, since there were no rights to any kind 
              of retirement benefit. Most older workers were simply dismissed 
              when their productive years were behind them.</p>
<p>One of the first formal company pension plans for industrial workers 
              was introduced in 1882 by the Alfred Dolge Company, a builder of 
              pianos and organs. Dolge withheld 1% of each workersâ pay and placed 
              it into a pension fund, to which the company added 6% interest each 
              year. Dolge viewed providing for older workers as being a business 
              cost like any other, arguing that just as his company had to provide 
              for the depreciation of its machinery, he should also "provide 
              for the depreciation of his employees." Despite Mr. Dolgeâs 
              progressive ideas and his best intentions, the plan proved largely 
              unsuccessful since it required a worker to spend many years in continuous 
              employment with the company, and labor mobility, then as now, meant 
              that relatively few workers spend their whole working career with 
              one company. Not only was the Dolge Plan one of the first formal 
              company pension systems in industrial America, it was also one of 
              the first to disappear when the company went out of business a few 
              years later.</p>
<p>The biggest problem with company-provided pensions was that  the percentage of workers anticipating 
              an employment-related pension from their company or their union 
              was tiny. Indeed, in 1900 there were a total 
              of five companies in the United States (including Dolge) offering 
              their industrial workers company-sponsored pensions. As late as 1932, only about 15% of the laborforce had any kind of potential employment-related pension. And because the pensions were often granted or withheld at the option of the employer, most of these workers would never see a retirement pension. Indeed, only about 5% of the elderly were in fact receiving retirement pensions in 1932. </p>
<p>So the company 
                pension was an option not available to most Americans during the 
              time prior to the advent of Social Security. </p>

<font color="#003399" size="5">The March of Coxey's Army</font></p>
<p>The Great Depression of the 1930s was not the only one in America's 
              history. In fact, it was the third depression of the modern era, 
              following previous economic collapses in the 1840s and again in 
              the 1890s. During the depression of the 1890s unemployment was widespread 
              and many Americans came to the realization that in an industrialized 
              society the threat to economic security represented by unemployment 
              could strike anyone--even those able and willing to work. Protest 
              movements arose--the most quixotic and notable being that of "Coxey's 
              Army."</p>
<p>
</p><table border="0" width="100%">

<td>Jacob Coxey was an unsuccessful Ohio politician and industrialist 
                  who, in 1894, called on the unemployed from all over the country 
                  to join him in an "army" marching on Washington. Ten 
                  of thousands of unemployed workers started marches, but by the 
                  time Coxey and his group finally made it to Washington only 
                  about 500 hard-core believers remained. Coxey himself was promptly 
                  arrested for walking on the grass of the Capitol Building and 
                  the protest fizzled out. Coxey later became an advocate of public 
                  works as a remedy for unemployment and ran for president as 
                  the Farmer-Labor party candidate in 1932 and 1936. (Coxey was 
                  also an ardent proponent of the free-silver monetary policy 
                  and an opponent of the gold standard. Perhaps to demonstrate 
                  his earnestness on monetary issues he even named his son Legal 
                  Tender Coxey!)</td>

<br/>
            Although his march failed, Coxey's Army was a harbinger of an issue 
            that would rise to prominence as unemployment insurance would become 
            a key element in the future Social Security Act. (Ohio would continue 
            to play an important role in the development of unemployment insurance 
            as its state program was one of two looked to as models for the new 
            federal program--the other being the program in operation in Wisconsin.) 
            <p></p>
<p><br/>
<font color="#003399" size="5">State Old-Age Pensions</font></p>
<p>Following the outbreak of the Great Depression, poverty among the 
              elderly grew dramatically. The best estimates are that in 1934 over 
              half of the elderly in America lacked sufficient income to be self-supporting. 
              Despite this, state welfare pensions for the elderly were practically 
              non-existent before 1930. A spurt of pension legislation was passed 
              in the years immediately prior to passage of the Social Security 
              Act, so that 30 states had some form of old-age pension program 
              by 1935. However, these programs were generally inadequate and ineffective. 
              Only about 3% of the elderly were actually receiving benefits under 
              these states plans, and the average benefit amount was about 65 
              cents a day.</p>
<p>There were many reasons for the low participation in state-run 
              pension systems. Many elderly were reluctant to "go on welfare." 
              Restrictive eligibility criteria kept many poor seniors from qualifying. 
              Some jurisdictions, while having state programs on the books, failed 
              to actually implement them. Many of the state-passed pension laws 
              provided for counties within the state to opt to participate in 
              the pension program. As a result, in 1929 of the six states with 
              operating pension laws on the books only 53 of the 264 counties 
              eligible to adopt a pension plan actually did so. After 1929, the 
              States began enacting laws without county options. By 1932 seventeen 
              states had old age pension laws, although none were in the south, 
              and 87% of the money available under these laws were expended in 
              only three states (California, Massachusetts and New York).</p>

<font color="#003399" size="5">America Changes</font></p>
<p>Despite all of the institutional strategies adopted in early America 
              to assure some measure of economic security, huge changes would 
              sweep through America which would, in time, undermine the existing 
              institutions. Four important demographic changes happened in America 
              beginning in the mid-1880s that rendered the traditional systems 
              of economic security increasingly unworkable:</p>
<ul>
<li><font color="#003399">The Industrial Revolution</font>
</li><li><font color="#003399">The urbanization of America</font>
</li><li><font color="#003399">The disappearance of the "extended" 
                family</font>
</li><li><font color="#003399">A marked increase in life expectancy</font>
</li></ul>
<p>The Industrial Revolution transformed the majority of working people 
              from self-employed agricultural workers into wage earners working 
              for large industrial concerns. In an agricultural society, prosperity 
              could be easily seen to be linked to one's labor, and anyone willing 
              to work could usually provide at least a bare subsistence for themselves 
              and their family. But when economic income is primarily from wages, 
              one's economic security can be threatened by factors outside one's 
              control--such as recessions, layoffs, failed businesses, etc.</p>
<p>Along with the shift from an agricultural to an industrial society, 
              Americans moved from farms and small rural communities to large 
              cities--that's where the industrial jobs were. In 1890, only 28% 
              of the population lived in cities, by 1930 this percentage had exactly 
              doubled, to 56%.</p>

                    history, more people were living in cities than on farms.</div></td>

<p></p>
</center>
<p>This trend toward urbanization also contributed to another significant 
              shift in American society, the disappearance of the extended family 
              and the rapid rise of the nuclear family. Today we tend to assume 
              that "the family" consists of parents and children--the 
              so-called nuclear family. For most of our history, we lived in "extended 
              families" that included children, parents, grandparents and 
              other relatives. The advantage of the extended family was that when 
              a family member became too old or infirm to work, the other family 
              members assumed responsibility for their support. But when the able-bodied 
              left the farms to seek employment in the cities, often the parents 
              or grandparents stayed behind. And when new immigrants first arrived 
              in our land, it was often the breadwinner who first made the passage 
              and only later could he bring the family over.</p>
<p>And finally, another significant change happened in the early decades 
              of this century. Thanks primarily to better health care and sanitation, 
              and the development of effective public health programs, Americans 
              began to live significantly longer. In three short decades, 1900-1930, 
              average life spans increased by 10 years. This was the most rapid 
              increase in life spans in recorded human history. The result was 
              a rapid growth in the number of aged persons, to 7.8 million by 
              1935.</p>
<p>The net result of this complex set of demographic and social changes 
              was that America was older, more urban and more industrial, and 
              fewer of its people lived on the land in extended families. The 
              traditional strategies for the provision of economic security were 
              becoming increasingly fragile.</p>
<p><br/>
<font color="#003399" size="5">The Stock Market Crash &amp; The 
              Great Depression</font></p>
<p>When the New York Stock Exchange opened on the morning of October 
              24, 1929, nervous traders sensed something ominous in the trading 
              patterns. By 11:00 a.m. the market had started to plunge. Shortly 
              after noon a group of powerful bankers met secretly at J.P. Morgan 
              &amp; Co. next door to the Exchange and pledged to spend $240 million 
              of their own funds to stabilize the market. This strategy worked 
              for a few days, but the panic broke out again the following Tuesday, 
              when the market crashed again, and nothing could be done to stop 
              it.</p>
<p>Before three months had passed, the Stock Market lost 40% of its 
              value; $26 billion of wealth disappeared. Great American corporations 
              suffered huge financial losses. AT&amp;T lost one-third of its value, 
              General Electric lost half of its, and RCA's stock fell by three-fourths 
              within a matter of months. (It would take 25 years for the stock 
              market to return to its pre-crash level following the 1929 crash.)</p>
<p>As America slipped into <a href="depression.html">economic depression</a> following the Crash

              levels, net new business investment was a minus $5.8 billion in 
              1932. Wages paid to workers declined from $50 billion in 1929 to 
              only $30 billion in 1932.</p>

              two million adult men ("hobos") wandered aimlessly around 
              the country, banks and businesses failed and the majority of the

                  It called upon the federal government to guarantee every family

                  The Share Our Wealth program immediately became a movement. 
                  Clubs were formed in every state in the nation. By 1935 the 
                  movement claimed 27,000 local clubs with 7.7 million members.</td>

<p><a href="towns5.html">Francis E. Townsend</a> was a lean, bespectacled 
              doctor from Long Beach, California. In 1933 he found himself unemployed 
              at age 66 with no savings and no prospects. This experience galvanized 
              him to become the self-proclaimed champion of the cause of the elderly. 
              He devised a plan known as the Townsend Old Age Revolving Pension 
              Plan, or Townsend Plan for short.</p>

                      Plan was that the government would provide a pension of 
                      $200 per month to every citizen age 60 and older. The pensions 
                      would be funded by a 2% national sales tax. There were three 
                      eligibility requirements:</p>
<div align="left">
<ul>
<li>the person had to be retired;

                          within 30 days of receipt. 
                      </li></ul>

<p align="left">Dr. Townsend published his plan in a local 
                      Long Beach newspaper in early 1933 and within about two 
                      years there were 7,000 Townsend Clubs around the country 
                      with more than 2.2 million members actively working to make 
                      the Townsend Plan the nation's old-age pension system. </p></td>

                      The Townsend Plan, however, hung around at least until the

                  state-run bartering enterprises, a tax on idle land and floating 
                  a large state bond for $300 million. Point 10 of the plan was

                  over 60 who had lived in California for at least three years. 
                  There was a state pension plan in operation in California at

                  not qualify. (This was true of many of the state pension programs 
                  around the country.) Sinclair's pension proposal was very popular 
                  because in one fell swoop it reduced the minimum age for pensions 
                  by 10 years, almost doubled their value, and eliminated restrictive 
                  eligibility requirements.</font></td>

<p>Sinclair's EPIC program, and especially its pension proposal, had 
              a great appeal in Depression-weary California. Sinclair and his 
              supporters organized EPIC clubs, published newsletters, formed ad 
              hoc organizations and found a large chorus of supporters with unlimited 
              enthusiasm for his ideas. In short order, Upton Sinclair's EPIC 
              movement captured the Democratic party and Sinclair became the Democratic 
              nominee for governor in the election of 1934. The party's platform 
              became the EPIC program, including the pension plan.</p>
<p>When the votes were counted, Upton Sinclair got 37% of the vote, 
              the Republican candidate got 48% and a third-party progressive candidate 
              took another 13%. Had it been a two-man race, Upton Sinclair might 
              have become Governor of California and the EPIC pension plan might 
              well have become the California model.</p>

<a name="eggs"></a><b><font color="black" size="4">Ham &amp; Eggs:</font></b></p>
<p>During the 1930s California was a virtual hot-house for new pension 
              schemes, and one of the most creative (and dubious) of the pension 
              schemes of the 1930s went by the unlikely moniker of "Ham &amp; 
              Eggs." Ham &amp; Eggs was the brainstorm of a self-promoting 
              huckster in-aptly named Robert Noble. The scheme was based on a 
              call for the state government to issue special currency called "scrip" 
              that would be paid each week to every unemployed Californian age 
              50 and older. Questions about the validity of the economics did 
              not dampen the enthusiasm of the movement's supporters, nor even 
              did the numerous scandals, financial and otherwise, involving the 
              movement's leaders. The eventual form of the plan called for the 
              state to issue "$30 every Thursday," which became the 
              rallying cry of the movement. The simplicity of the movement was 
              expressed in a bit of doggerel from the organization's newsletter 
              the <em><a href="eggs.html">National Ham and Eggs</a></em>:</p>

<p>The Ham &amp; Eggs movement had more than 300,000 members--and 
              many more supporters. In 1938 the successful Democratic candidate 
              for governor, Culbert Olsen, openly supported the plan and a proposition 
              was placed on the ballot to adopt the Ham &amp; Eggs plan as California 
              state policy. The proposition was narrowly defeated by a vote of 
              1,143,670 in favor to 1,398,999 against.</p>
<p>The Ham &amp; Eggs movement was based on dubious economics, it 
              was founded and run by a succession of characters of questionable 
              integrity, it suffered from internecine rivalries and frequent scandals, 
              and yet, at the peak of its influence in 1938, more than a million 
              Californians, including the state's Governor, believed that it was 
              the solution to the problem of income security for the aged. That 
              such a poor candidate for a public policy would be so widely embraced 
              is strong evidence of how hungry the public was for action to address 
              the problem of income security for the elderly.</p>

<b><font size="4">Bigelow Plan:</font></b></p>
<p>In Ohio, Reverend Herbert S. Bigelow initiated a proposed State 
              amendment to guarantee an income of $50 a month ($80 for married 
              couples living together) to those over sixty years of age who were 
              without gainful employment. This particular plan was to be financed 
              partly out of an increased tax on real estate (2% hike on land valued 
              at more than $20,000 an acre), and partly out of an income tax equal 
              to one-fourth the federal income tax paid by individuals and corporations. 
              The Bigelow pension plan garnered nearly half a million voters before 
              it was defeated. As some experts of the time calculated, the plan 
              would cost more than the existing state budget for two years.</p>

              comes to the White House from Virginia. "I'm a 60 year-old 
              widow greatly in need of medical aid, food and fuel, I pray that 
              you would have pity on me." Letters such as these came by the 
              thousands from old folks across the country to the President, to 
              Mrs. Roosevelt, to almost every one in Washington whose name was 
              familiar to them.</p>
<p align="CENTER"><a href="lettertoFDR.html"><span style="Font-Size : 12pt">Typical 
              Letter to President Roosevelt, Appealing for Old-Age Pensions</span></a></p>
<p>It isn't any wonder then, why the elderly looked to the various 
              organizations that sprang up around the country offering salvation 
              in some form of an old-age pension plan. One such organization was 
              the General Welfare Federation of America. Headquartered in Washington, 
              DC, and founded by Arthur L. Johnson, who denounced the newly established 
              Social Security Act as a "great American fraud." He was 
              just as severe in attacking other organizations such as the Townsend, 
              Ham-and-Eggs, and Bigelow plans as "crackpot" pension 
              schemes.<br/>
<br/>
              Mr. Johnson's plan, like most of the others, wiped out the elaborate 
              system of employment records kept under the present Social Security 
              Act. Instead, it provided for a pension to every citizen on or after 
              reaching the age of 60, with the simple stipulation that they not 
              engage in gainful employment, that they spend their pension for 
              American goods and services, and that they not maintain able-bodied 
              male dependents between the ages of 30 and 60.<br/>
<br/>
              The pension would be fixed at not less than $30 a month and not 
              more than $60 a month. The actual amount would be determined by 
              dividing the total funds available by the total number of annuitants. 
              The funds would be derived from a gross income tax of 2 percent 
              on individuals and corporations, with exceptions to protect charitable, 
              religious, cooperative and similar organizations. The proponents 
              of the this plan did manage did get it introduced in the House of 
              Representatives, however, the bill died in committee in 1939 before 
              ever reaching a House vote.<br/>

<b><font color="black" size="4">Technocracy:</font><font size="4"><br/>
</font></b><br/>
              Out of America's fascination with technology came another eccentric 
              "reform" movement known as Technocracy. Founded in 1918 
              by a California patent attorney it would briefly flare as a serious 
              intellectual movement centered around Columbia University; although 
              as a mass-movement its real center was California where it claimed 
              half a million members in 1934. Technocracy counted among its admirers 
              such men as the novelist H.G. Wells, the author Theodore Dreiser 
              and the economist Thorstein Veblen.</p>
<p>Technocracy held that all politics and all economic arrangements 
              based on the "Price System" (i.e., based on traditional 
              economic theory) were antiquated and that the only hope of building 
              a successful modern world was to let engineers and other technology 
              experts run the country on engineering principles. Technocracy's 
              rallying cry was "production for use," which was meant 
              as a contrast to production for profit in the capitalist system. 
              Production for use became a slogan for many of the radical-left 
              movements of the era. Upton Sinclair, among others, affirmed his 
              belief in "production for use" and the Technocrats briefly 
              made common cause with Sinclair, and even Huey Long, in California. 
              But the Technocrats were not of the political left, as they held 
              every political and economic system, from the left to the right, 
              to be unsound. 
            </p><table border="0" width="100%">
<tbody><tr>
<td width="58%">The Technocrats believed that the solution to 
                  all problems of economic security were the same, the rigorous 
                  application of engineering principles in a system freed from 
                  the Price System. They conceived of retirement as being made 
                  possible at age 45 for everyone due to the vast prosperity the 
                  new age of Technocracy would usher in. Rejecting all forms of 
                  traditional political science, the Technocrats refused to even 
                  use standard geographical maps because their boundaries were 
                  political, so they would refer to states only by their geographical 
                  coordinates. Names, too, were suspect for some reason so members 
                  of the movement in California were designated only by numbers. 
                  A speaker at one California rally was introduced only as 1x1809x56!<br/>
<br/>
                  Oddly enough, alone among this collection of radical movements 
                  of the 1930s, the Technocracy movement survives, if not quite 
                  thrives, into the present day.</td>

<p>If America was to avoid the siren songs of the "radical calls 
              to action," responsible political leaders would need to offer 
              some persuasive alternatives. As the Depression grew, three general 
              approaches emerged: do nothing; rely on voluntary charity; and expand 
              welfare benefits for those hardest hit by the Depression.</p>
<p><b><font color="black" size="4">The Do Nothing Response</font></b></p>
<p>It seemed to many politicians and leading public figures that the 
              Depression was just another dip in the economic cycle and that it 
              would right itself soon enough. These voices counseled a restrained 
              response, or no response at all. In the early aftermath of the stock 
              market crash such views were especially common.</p>
<p>This view that nothing very much was wrong and nothing very much 
              needed to be done, began to fade quickly as the Depression deepened. 
              Even so, it held considerable sway in the early years after The 
              Crash.</p>
<p><b><font color="black" size="4">President Hoover's</font></b><font color="black" size="4">
</font><b><font color="black" size="4">"Volunteerism"</font></b></p>
<p><a href="hoover.html">President Hoover</a> had a distinguished 
              career before becoming president. He made a name for himself in 
              international relief efforts before and after World War I. He helped 
              feed millions of starving people, through the efforts of voluntary 
              partnerships of government, business and private giving. He knew 
              this kind of "volunteerism" worked, on a massive scale, 
              and he saw no reason why it should not work to solve the problems 
              of the Depression. So although he engaged in some limited federal 
              relief efforts, his main response to the Depression was to advocate 
              voluntary efforts, which never materialized.</p>
<p>The main problem with this strategy was that America was able to 
              help rebuild Europe in the aftermath of World War I because America's 
              economy was basically sound. In the Depression the total wealth 
              of the nation was cut in half during the first three years after 
              The Crash. This made voluntary charity a difficult ideal to achieve.</p>

<p><b><font color="black" size="4">Expand Welfare</font></b></p>
<p>Even before the Depression hit, the States had been forced to deal 
              with the problems of economic security in a wage-based, industrial 
              economy. Workers Compensation programs were established at the state 
              level before Social Security, and there were state welfare programs 
              for the elderly in place before Social Security. Prior to Social 
              Security, the main strategy for providing economic security to the 
              elderly, in the face of the demographic changes discussed above, 
              was to provide various forms of old-age "pensions." These 
              were welfare programs, eligibility for which was based on proof 
              of financial need. By 1934, most states had such "pension" 
              plans. Even at the state level, however, these plans were inadequate. 
              Some had restrictive eligibility criteria which resulted in many 
              of the elderly being unable to qualify. The most generous plan paid 
              a maximum of $1 per day.</p>
<p>In the Congress, the consensus of conventional wisdom was for more 
              old-age assistance like that available in the states. </p>
<p><br/>
<b><font color="black" size="4">The "New" Alternative</font></b></p>
<p>With the coming to office of President Roosevelt in 1932, and the 
              introduction of his economic security proposal based on social insurance 
              rather than welfare assistance, the debate changed. It was no longer 
              a choice between radical changes and old approaches that no longer 
              seemed to work. The "new" idea of social insurance, which 
              was already widespread in Europe, would become an innovative alternative.</p>
<p>Social insurance, as conceived by President Roosevelt, would address 
              the permanent problem of economic security for the elderly by creating 
              a work-related, contributory system in which workers would provide 
              for their own future economic security through taxes paid while 
              employed. Thus it was an alternative both to reliance on welfare 
              and to radical changes in our capitalist system. In the context 
              of its time, it can be seen as a moderately conservative, yet activist, 
              response to the challenges of the Depression.</p>

<td rowspan="2">The Social Security program that would eventually 
                  be adopted in late 1935 relied for its core principles on the 
                  concept of "social insurance." Social insurance was 
                  a respectable and serious intellectual tradition that began 
                  in Europe in the 19th century and was an expression of a European 
                  social welfare tradition. It was first adopted in Germany in 
                  1889 at the urging of the famous Chancellor, <a href="ottob.html">Otto 
                  von Bismarck</a>. Indeed, by the time America adopted social 
                  insurance in 1935, there were <a href="pre1935.html">34 nations 
                  already operating some form of social insurance program</a>(about 
                  20 of these were contributory programs like Social Security). 
                  Philosophically, social insurance emphasized government-sponsored 
                  efforts to provide for the economic security of its citizens. 
                  The tradition of social insurance would come to be seen as the 
                  reasonable, practical alternative to the radical calls to action 
                  represented by Townsend, Long, Sinclair and the others.</td>

<p>Although the definition of social insurance can vary considerably 
              in its particulars, its basic features are: the <em>insurance principle</em> 
              under which a group of persons are "insured" in some way 
              against a defined risk, and a <em>social element</em> which usually 
              means that the program is shaped in part by broader social objectives, 
              rather than being shaped solely by the self-interest of the individual 
              participants. Social insurance coverage can be provided for a number 
              of different types of insured conditions, from disability and death 
              to old-age or unemployment. We may find it obvious to think of death, 
              disability or unemployment as conditions causing loss of income 
              and which can be ameliorated by pooling of risk. It is at first 
              a little odd to think of old-age or retirement in these same terms. 
              But that is precisely how the early social insurance theorists conceived 
              of retirement, as producing a loss of income due to cessation of 
              work activity. </p>
<p>One of the first American books on social insurance was by a Columbia 
              University economics professor named Henry Seager. Seager explained 
              the principle of old-age security based on social insurance in his 
              1910 book, <em>"Social Insurance, A Program of Social Reform"</em>:</p>
<p><em>"As changing economic conditions are rendering the dependence 
              of old people on their descendants for support increasingly precarious, 
              so, on the other hand, new obstacles are arising to providing for 
              old age through voluntary saving. . . The proper method of safeguarding 
              old age is clearly through some plan of insurance. . . for every 
              wage earner to attempt to save enough by himself to provide for 
              his old age is needlessly costly. The intelligent course is for 
              him to combine with other wage earners to accumulate a common fund 
              out of which old-age annuities may be paid to those who live long 
              enough to need it."</em></p>
<p><a name="tr"></a>One of the earliest American advocates of a plan 
              that could be recognized as modern social insurance was <a href="trinfo.html">Theodore 
              Roosevelt</a>. In 1912, Roosevelt <a href="trspeech.html">addressed 
              the convention of the Progressive Party</a> and made a strong statement 
              on behalf of social insurance:</p>

<font color="#003399" size="5">The Threshold of Change</font></p>
<p>So as 1934 dawned the nation was deep in the throes of the Depression. 
              Confidence in the old institutions was shaken. Social changes that 
              started with the Industrial Revolution had long ago passed the point 
              of no return. The traditional sources of economic security: assets; 
              labor; family; and charity, had all failed in one degree or another. 
              Radical proposals for action were springing like weeds from the 
              soil of the nation's discontent. President Franklin Roosevelt would 
              choose the social insurance approach as the "cornerstone" 
              of his attempts to deal with the problem of economic security.

<p>The CES assembled a small staff of experts borrowed from other

<p><a name="major"></a><font color="#003399" size="5">Major Provisions 
              Of The Act</font></p>
<p>The Social Security Act did not quite achieve all the aspirations 
              its supporters had hoped by way of providing a "comprehensive 
              package of protection" against the "hazards and vicissitudes 
              of life." Certain features of that package, notably disability 
              coverage and medical benefits, would have to await future developments. 
              But it did provide a wide range of programs to meet the nation's 
              needs. In addition to the program we now think of as Social Security, 
              it included unemployment insurance, old-age assistance, aid to dependent 
              children and <a href="medicalcare.html">grants to the states to provide various forms 
              of medical care</a>.</p>
<p align="CENTER"><a href="35actinx.html">(Full text of 1935 Act)</a></p>
<p>The two major provisions relating to the elderly were Title I- 
              Grants to States for Old-Age Assistance, which supported state welfare 
              programs for the aged, and Title II-Federal Old-Age Benefits. It 
              was Title II that was the new social insurance program we now think 
              of as Social Security. In the original Act benefits were to be paid 
              only to the primary worker when he/she retired at age 65. Benefits 
              were to be based on payroll tax contributions that the worker made 
              during his/her working life. Taxes would first be collected in 1937 
              and monthly benefits would begin in 1942. (Under amendments passed 
              in 1939, payments were advanced to 1940.)</p>
<p>The significance of the new social insurance program was that it 
              sought to address the long-range problem of economic security for 
              the aged through a contributory system in which the workers themselves 
              contributed to their own future retirement benefit by making regular 
              payments into a joint fund. It was thus distinct from the welfare 
              benefits provided under Title I of the Act and from the various 
              state "old-age pensions." As President Roosevelt conceived 
              of the Act, Title I was to be a temporary "relief" program 
              that would eventually disappear as more people were able to obtain 
              retirement income through the contributory system. The new social 
              insurance system was also a very moderate alternative to the radical 
              calls to action that were so common in the America of the 1930s.</p>

<p>The monumental first task was the need to register employers and 
              workers by January 1, 1937, when workers would begin acquiring credits 
              toward old-age insurance benefits. Since the new Social Security 
              Board did not have the resources available to accomplish this, they 
              <a href="postmen.html">contracted with the Post Office Department 
              to distribute the applications</a>. The first application forms 
              were distributed in late November 1936. The numbers were assigned 
              in the local post offices. There is no record of who received the 
              first Social Security number (SSN).

            Over 30 million SSN cards were issued through this early procedure, 
            with the help of the post offices. By June 30, 1937, the SSB had established 
            151 field offices, with <a href="aaustin.html">the first office opening

<font color="#003399" size="5">Trust Funds</font></p>
<p>After Social Security numbers were assigned, the first Federal 
              Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) taxes were collected, beginning 
              in January 1937. Special Trust Funds were created for these dedicated 
              revenues. Benefits were then paid from the money in the Social Security 
              Trust Funds. <a href="trustfunds.html">Over the years, more than 
              $8.7 trillion has been paid into the Trust Funds, and more than 
              $7.4 trillion has been paid out in benefits.</a> The remainder is 
              currently on reserve in the Trust Funds and will be used to pay 
              future benefits.</p>
<p><br/>
<a name="firstcheck"></a><font color="#003399" size="5">First Payments</font></p>
<p>From 1937 until 1940, Social Security paid benefits in the form 
              of a single, lump-sum payment. The purpose of these one-time payments 
              was to provide some "payback" to those people who contributed 
              to the program but would not participate long enough to be vested 
              for monthly benefits. Under the 1935 law, monthly benefits were 
              to begin in 1942, with the period 1937-1942 used both to build up 
              the Trust Funds and to provide a minimum period for participation 
              in order to qualify for monthly benefits.</p>

<p>The original Act provided only retirement benefits, and only to 
              the worker. The 1939 Amendments made a fundamental change in the 
              Social Security program. The Amendments added two new categories 
              of benefits: payments to the spouse and minor children of a retired 
              worker (so-called dependents benefits) and survivors benefits paid 
              to the family in the event of the premature death of a covered worker. 
              This change transformed Social Security from a retirement program 
              for workers into a <i>family-based</i> economic security program.</p>
<p>The 1939 Amendments also increased benefit amounts and accelerated 
              the start of monthly benefit payments to 1940.</p>

<p><font color="#003399" size="5">The Atlantic Charter</font></p>
<p>In mid-August, 1941, <a href="acharter1.html">Winston Churchill 
              and Franklin Roosevelt met secretly aboard a warship off the coast 
              of Newfoundland in the North Atlantic</a>. On the sixth anniversary 
              of the Social Security Act, they announced a joint-declaration known 
              as the Atlantic Charter. The <a href="acharter2.html">383-word Charter</a> 
              was an expression of "certain common principles in the national 
              policies of their respective countries on which they base their 
              hopes for a better future for the world." This brief charter 
              would be the founding document of the United Nations and among its 
              eight principles was a call for social insurance. Former Social 
              Security Board Chairman John Winant was then serving as the U.S. 
              Ambassador to Great Britain. Although Winant did not attend the 
              Conference, the social insurance provision was a suggestion he made 
              from London which was instantly accepted by Churchill and FDR.</p>
<p>Although social insurance began in Germany in the 19th century, 
              in the years following World War II the United States was the leading 
              model for nations around the world who were interested in designing 
              Social Security systems. This movement toward the internationalization 
              of Social Security can be symbolically fixed with the issuance of 
              the Atlantic Charter in 1941.</p>
<p><br/>
<a name="1950"></a><font color="#003399" size="5">1950 Amendments</font></p>
<p>From 1940 until 1950 virtually no changes were made in the Social 
              Security program. Payment amounts were fixed, and no major legislation 
              was enacted. There was a significant administrative change in 1946, 
              however, when the three-person <a href="boardmembers.html">Social 
              Security Board</a> was abolished and replaced by the Social Security 
              Administration, headed by a single <a href="commissioners.html">Commissioner</a>.</p>
<p>Because the program was still in its infancy, and because it was 
              financed by low levels of payroll taxation, the absolute value of 
              Social Security's retirement benefits were very low. In fact, until 
              1951, the average value of the welfare benefits received under the 
              old-age assistance provisions of the Act were higher than the retirement 
              benefits received under Social Security. And there were more elderly 
              Americans receiving old-age assistance than were receiving Social 
              Security.</p>
<p>Because of these shortcomings in the program, <a href="truman50.html">in 
              1950 major amendments were enacted</a>. These amendments increased 
              benefits for existing beneficiaries for the first time (see The 
              Story of COLAs), and they dramatically increased the value of the 
              program to future beneficiaries. By February 1951 there were more 
              Social Security retirees than welfare pensioners, and by August 
              of that year, the average Social Security retirement benefit exceeded 
              the average old-age assistance grant for the first time.</p>
<p><br/>
<a name="colas"></a><font color="#003399" size="5">The Story of 
              COLAs</font></p>
<p>Most people are aware that there are annual increases in Social 
              Security benefits to offset the corrosive effects of inflation on 
              fixed incomes. These increases, now known as Cost of Living Allowances 
              (COLAs), are such an accepted feature of the program that it is 
              difficult to imagine a time when there were no COLAs. But in fact, 
              when Ida May Fuller received her first $22.54 benefit payment in 
              January of 1940, this would be the same amount she would receive 
              each month for the next 10 years. For Ida May Fuller, and the millions 
              of other Social Security beneficiaries like her, the amount of that 
              first benefit check was the amount they could expect to receive 
              for life. It was not until the 1950 Amendments that Congress first 
              legislated an increase in benefits. Current beneficiaries had their 
              payments recomputed and Ida May Fuller, for example, saw her monthly 
              check increase from $22.54 to $41.30.</p>
<p>These recomputations were effective for September 1950 and appeared 
              for the first time in the October 1950 checks. A second increase 
              was legislated for September 1952. Together these two increases 
              almost doubled the value of Social Security benefits for existing 
              beneficiaries. From that point on, benefits were increased only 
              when Congress enacted special legislation for that purpose.</p>
<p><a href="Nixon72.html">In 1972 legislation</a> the law was changed 
              to provide, beginning in 1975, for automatic annual cost-of-living 
              allowances (i.e., COLAs) based on the annual increase in consumer 
              prices. No longer do beneficiaries have to await a special act of 
              Congress to receive a benefit increase and no longer does inflation 
              drain value from Social Security benefits.</p>

<p>The Social Security Amendments of 1954 initiated a disability insurance 
              program which provided the public with additional coverage against 
              economic insecurity. At first, there was a disability "freeze", 
              <a href="eisensm.html">(here being signed by <b>President Eisenhower</b>)</a> 
              of a worker's Social Security record during the years when they 
              were unable to work. (<a href="dibfreeze.html">First application 
              for disability freeze being filed</a>.) While this measure offered 
              no cash benefits, it did prevent such periods of disability from 
              reducing or wiping out retirement and survivor benefits. On August 
              1, 1956, the Social Security Act was amended to provide benefits 
              to disabled workers aged 50-64 and disabled adult children. In September 
              1960 President Eisenhower signed a law amending the disability rules 
              to permit payment of benefits to disabled workers of any age and 
              to their dependents. By 1960, 559,000 people 
              were receiving disability benefits, with the average benefit 
              amount being around $80 per month.</p>

              Other Changes</font></p>
<p>The decade of the 1960s brought major changes to the Social Security 
              program. <a href="1961amend.html">Under the Amendments of 1961</a>, 
              the age at which men are first eligible for old-age insurance was 
              lowered to 62, with benefits actuarially reduced (women previously 
              were given this option in 1956). This created an additional workload 
              for the Agency as more beneficiaries entered the rolls. The number 
              of people receiving disability benefits more than doubled from 1961 
              to 1969, increasing from 742,000 to 1.7 million.</p>
<p>The most significant administrative change involved the signing 
              of the Medicare bill on July 30, 1965, by <a href="lbjsm.html">President Lyndon Johnson</a><b> </b>In the presence 
              of former President Truman, who received the first Medicare card 
              at the ceremony, Lady Bird Johnson, Vice-President Hubert Humphrey, 
              and Mrs. Truman. With the signing of this bill, SSA became responsible 
              for administering a new social insurance program that extended health 
              coverage to almost all Americans aged 65 
              or older. Nearly 20 million beneficiaries enrolled in Medicare 
              in the first 3 years of the program.</p>

<p><a name="SSI"></a><font color="#003399" size="5">SSI</font></p>
<p>In the 1970s, SSA became responsible for a new program, Supplemental 
              Security Income (SSI). In the original 1935 Social Security Act, 
              programs were introduced for needy aged and blind individuals and, 
              in 1950, needy disabled individuals were added. These three programs 
              were known as the "adult categories" and were administered 
              by State and local governments with partial Federal funding. Over 
              the years, the State programs became more complex and inconsistent, 
              with as many as 1,350 administrative agencies involved and payments 
              varying more than 300% from State to State.</p>
<p>In 1969, <a href="rmnstate.html">President Nixon</a> identified 
              a need to reform these and related welfare programs to "bring 
              reason, order, and purpose into a tangle of overlapping programs." 
              In 1971, Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare, <a href="richards.html">Elliot 
              Richardson</a>, proposed that SSA assume responsibility for the 
              "adult categories." In the Social Security Amendments 
              of 1972, Congress federalized the "adult categories" by 
              creating the SSI program and assigned responsibility for it to SSA.</p>
<p>SSA was chosen to administer the new program because of its reputation 
              for successful administration of the existing social insurance programs. 
              SSA's nationwide network of field offices and large-scale data processing 
              and record-keeping operations also made it the logical choice to 
              perform the major task of converting over 3 million people from 
              State welfare programs to SSI.</p>
<p><font color="#003399" size="5"><br/>
              The 1972 &amp; 1977 Amendments</font></p>
<p>In 1972 two important sets of amendments were enacted. These amendments 
              created the SSI program and introduced automatic Cost-of-Living-Adjustments 
              (COLAs).</p>
<p>The bill creating the SSI program also contained important provisions 
              for increasing Social Security benefits for certain categories of 
              beneficiaries (primarily aged widows and widowers). It also provided: 
              a minimum retirement benefit; an adjustment to the benefit formula 
              governing early retirement at age 62 for men, in order to make it 
              consistent with that for women; extension of Medicare to those who 
              have received disability benefits for at least two years and to 
              those with Chronic Renal Disease; liberalized the Retirement Test; 
              and provided for Delayed Retirement Credits to increase the benefits 
              of those who delayed retirement past age 65.</p>

<td width="75%">The separate bill creating automatic COLAs also 
                  provided for automatic increases in the earnings subject to 
                  Social Security taxes and an automatic adjustment in the wage-base 
                  used in calculating benefits. This second adjustment was put 
                  in the law as a sort of companion to the COLA. The COLA adjusts 
                  for increases in <i>prices</i>, whereas the wage-base adjustment 
                  corrects for increases in <i>wages</i>. The purpose of the COLA 
                  was to maintain the purchasing power of benefits already awarded. 
                  The purpose of the automatic adjustment in the wage base was 
                  to maintain the relative value of Social Security benefits for 
                  future applicants. Unfortunately, the procedure for adjusting 
                  for price and wage increases contained a flaw which resulted 
                  in future benefit levels soaring out of control. Indeed, it 
                  became apparent that if the trends of the mid-1970s continued, 
                  future Social Security beneficiaries could end up receiving 
                  more in their monthly retirement benefit than their gross salaries 
                  while working. This problem was corrected in the 1977 Amendments. 
                  However, the correction led to the appearance of what came to 
                  be known informally as "<a href="notchbase.html">The Notch</a>."</td>

<p><a href="77amend.html">The main purpose of the 1977 Amendments</a> 
              was to address the financing of the program. Shortly after passage 
              of the 1972 legislation, it became apparent that Social Security 
              faced a funding shortfall, both in the short-term and in the long-term. 
              The short-term problem was caused by the bad economy, and the long-term 
              problem by the demographics associated with the baby boom. By their 
              1975 report the Trustees said the Trust Funds would be exhausted 
              by 1979. This financing shortfall was addressed by the 1977 Social 
              Security Amendments. These amendments raised the payroll tax slightly 
              (from 6.45% to the current 7.65%), increased the wage base; reduced 
              benefits slightly; and "decoupled" the wage adjustment 
              from the COLA adjustment. These fixes restored the long-term balance 
              of the program for the next 50 years (but not the full 75 years 
              used by the actuaries). It was hoped the amendments would prevent 
              an expected short-term financing problem in the early 1980s. This 
              hope would prove elusive as the major amendments in 1983 would be 
              needed to avoid the short-term problem, and to address the remaining 
              long-range program deficit.</p>
<p><font color="#003399" size="5">Disability In The 1980s</font></p>
<p>The Social Security Amendments of 1980 made many changes in the 
              disability program. Most of these changes focused on various work 
              incentive provisions for both Social Security and SSI disability 
              benefits.<br/>
<br/>
              The 1980 Amendments also required SSA to conduct periodic reviews 
              of current disability beneficiaries to certify their continuing 
              eligibility. This was to become a massive workload for SSA and one 
              that was highly controversial. By 1983, the reviews had been halted, 
              and in 1984, Congress passed the Disability Benefits Reform Act 
              modifying several aspects of the disability program.</p>

<p>In the early 1980s the Social Security program faced a serious 
              short-term financing crisis. President Reagan appointed a blue-ribbon 
              panel, known as the <a href="reports/gspan.html">Greenspan Commission</a>, 
              to study the financing issues and make recommendations for legislative 
              changes. The final bill, <a href="reagansm.html">signed into law 
              in 1983</a>, made numerous changes in the Social Security and Medicare 
              programs, including the taxation of Social Security benefits, the 
              first coverage of Federal employees under Social Security and an 
              increase in the retirement age in the next century. <a href="1983amend.html">(Summary 
              of the provisions of the '83 Amendments)</a></p>
<p><font color="#003399" size="5"><br/>
              Program Growth</font></p>
<p>From its modest beginnings, Social Security has grown to become 
              an essential facet of modern life. One in seven Americans receives 
              a Social Security benefit, and more than 90 percent of all workers 
              are in jobs covered by Social Security. From 1940, when slightly 
              more than 222,000 people received monthly Social Security benefits, 
              until today, when over 50 million people receive such benefits, 
              Social Security has grown steadily. The SSI program has grown as 
              well from its inception in 1974.</p>

<p><font color="#003399" size="5">Independence For SSA</font></p>
<p>The Social Security Board (SSB) began its life in 1935 as one of 
              the federal government's "independent agencies." This 
              means that it was not part of a larger cabinet-level organization. 
              In 1939 this status changed when the SSB became part of the new 
              cabinet-level Federal Security Agency. Ultimately, the Social Security 
              Board became the Social Security Administration and it would finally 
              become an operating component of the Department of Health &amp; 
              Human Services. (See <a href="orghist.html">SSA Organizational History</a>.)</p>
<p>Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, there was growing bipartisan support 
              for removing SSA from under its departmental umbrella and establishing 
              it as an independent agency. Finally, in 1994 the Social Security 
              Independence and Program Improvements Act of 1994 (P.L. 103-296) 
              was passed unanimously by Congress and, in a ceremony in the Rose 
              Garden of the White House, on August 14, 1994, <a href="clintnsm.html">President 
              Bill Clinton signed the act into law.</a></p>

<p><font color="#003399" size="5">Legislative Changes in 1996 &amp; 
              1997</font></p>
<p><i>Contract With America Advancement Act of 1996 (P.L. 104-121).</i></p>
<p>This bill, signed by the President on March 29, 1996, made a change 
              in the basic philosophy of the disability program. Beginning on 
              that date, new applicants for Social Security or SSI disability 
              benefits could no longer be eligible for benefits if drug addiction 
              or alcoholism is a material factor to their disability. Unless they 
              can qualify on some other medical basis, they cannot receive disability 
              benefits. Individuals in this category already receiving benefits, 
              are to have their benefits terminated as of January 1, 1997. Previous 
              policy has been that if a person has a medical condition that prevents 
              them from working, this qualifies them as disabled for Social Security 
              and SSI purposes--regardless of the cause of the disability. Another 
              significant provision of this law doubled the earnings limit exemption 
              amount for retired Social Security beneficiaries, on a gradual schedule 
              from 1996 to 2002. In 2002, the exempt amount will be $30,000 per 
              year in earnings, compared to $14,760 under previous law.</p>
<p><i>The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation 
              Act of 1996.</i></p>
<p>This "welfare reform" legislation, <a href="welref.html">signed 
              by the President on 8/22/96,</a> ended the categorical entitlement 
              to AFDC (Aid to Families with Dependent Children) that was part 
              of the original 1935 Social Security Act by implementing time-limited 
              benefits along with a work requirement. The law also terminated 
              SSI eligibility for most non-citizens. Previously, lawfully admitted 
              aliens could receive SSI if they met the other factors of entitlement. 
              As of the date of enactment, no new non-citizens could be added 
              to the benefit rolls and all existing non-citizen beneficiaries 
              would eventually be removed from the rolls (unless they met one 
              of the exceptions in the law.) Also effective upon enactment were 
              provisions eliminating the "comparable severity standard" 
              and reference to "maladaptive behavior" in the determination 
              of disability for children to receive SSI. Also, children currently 
              receiving benefits under the old standards were to be reviewed and 
              removed from the rolls if they could not qualify under the new standards.</p>
<p><i>Omnibus Consolidated Rescissions and Appropriations Act of 1996.</i></p>
<p>Requires that all federal payments (including Social Security and 
              SSI) be made by electronic funds transfer (no more paper checks) 
              effective January 1, 1999, unless a waiver is granted by the Secretary 
              of the Treasury.</p>
<p><i>The Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 1997</i></p>
<p>This massive omnibus spending bill contained SSA's budget as well 
              as numerous legislative changes relating to the SSI program and 
              to issues involved in fighting fraudulent documents in connection 
              with obtaining Social Security numbers. The major SSI provision 
              makes sponsorship agreements legally enforceable for the first time. 
              In the area of identification-related documents, the law requires 
              the establishment of federal standards for state-issued birth certificates 
              and requires SSA to develop a prototype counterfeit-resistant Social 
              Security card.</p>
<p><i>The Balanced Budget Act of 1997</i></p>
<p>This bill passed the House on 7/30/97 by a vote of 346 to 85, and 
              passed the Senate the next day on a vote of 85 to 15. This law restored 
              SSI eligibility to certain cohorts of non- citizens whose eligibility 
              otherwise would be terminated under the "welfare reform" 
              of 1996. It also extended for up to one year the period for redetermining 
              the eligibility of certain aliens who may ultimately not be eligible 
              for continued benefits.</p>
<p><br/>
<font color="#003399" size="5">The Social Security Advisory Board</font></p>
<p>From the very beginning, the Social Security program has had the 
              services of periodic Advisory Councils composed primarily of non-government 
              members whose function was to represent the public at large in advising 
              government officials on Social Security policy. The first such Advisory 
              Council was convened in 1934 in support of the work of the Committee 
              on Economic Security. Over the years, the Advisory Councils have 
              been very influential in setting the agenda for changes in Social 
              Security. The Councils were especially influential in shaping the 
              pivotal 1939 and 1950 amendments. Eventually, the tradition of periodic 
              Social Security Advisory Councils was made a standard provision 
              of the law, with a requirement that such a Council be appointed 
              every four years. This law stayed in effect until 1994, when it 
              was repealed as part of the legislation which made SSA an independent 
              agency. The <a href="reports/adcouncil/index.html">1994-1996 Advisory Council</a> 
              was thus the final Council, signaling the end of a long tradition 
              in Social Security. Under that 1994 law, the Councils are abolished 
              and a permanent <a href="adviseb.html">7-member Advisory Board</a> 
              was formed to serve many of the same functions.</p>
<p><br/>
<a name="work"></a><font color="#003399" size="5">Work Incentives</font></p>
<p>On December 17, 1999 the President signed the "<a href="ticket.html">Ticket 
              to Work and Work Incentives Improvement Act of 1999</a>"--one 
              of the most significant changes in disability policy in the last 
              20 years. This law creates a Ticket to Work and Self-Sufficiency 
              Program which will provide disability beneficiaries with a ticket 
              they may use to obtain vocational rehabilitation services, employment 
              services, and other support services from an employment network 
              of their choice. In addition to allowing beneficiaries to purchase 
              vocational services, the law provides incentive payments to providers 
              for successful rehabilitation in which the beneficiary returns to 
              work. The new provisions also provide a number of safeguards to 
              the beneficiaries to protect their benefits and health Taken together, 
              the Ticket to Work initiative seeks to shift the emphasis in the 
              disability program away from mere maintenance of benefits more toward 
              rehabilitating the disabled and assisting them in returning to productive 
              work.</p>

<a name="ret"></a><font color="#003399" size="5">Repeal of the Retirement

<p><font color="black">On April 7, 2000 </font> <font color="black">"<a href="clintonfreedom.html">The 
              Senior Citizens' Freedom to Work Act of 2000</a>" was signed 
              into law, eliminating the Retirement Earnings Test (RET) for those 
              beneficiaries at or above Normal Retirement Age (NRA). (The RET 
              still applies to those beneficiaries below NRA.)</font></p>
<p><font color="black">The legislation began its swift march through 
              Congress on March 1, 2000 when the full </font><a href="houseret.html">House of Representatives passed H.R. 5 by a vote 
              of 422 to 0</a><font color="black">. The Senate, on March 22, 2000 
              then </font><a href="senateret.html">passed the bill by a vote of 
              100-0</a><font color="black"> (with a technical amendment). On March 
              28, 2000 The House agreed to the Senate amendment by a vote of 419-0 
              and cleared the measure for transmission to the President.</font><font color="#CC9900" size="5"><br/>
</font><font color="black">This was a historic change in the Social 
              Security retirement program. From the beginning of Social Security 
              in 1935, retirement benefits have been conditional on the requirement 
              that the beneficiary be substantially retired. This requirement 
              was carried out by the provisions of the RET. </font><a href="ret.html">The 
              RET has changed considerably over the years</a><font color="black">. 
              The requirement was first scaled-back in the 1950 Amendments, which 
              exempted workers age 75 and older from the RET. The exempt age was 
              reduced to 72 in 1954, and to age 70 and older in 1977. With the 
              new legislation, starting at the NRA, Social Security retirement 
              benefits will be paid to beneficiaries who are still working. Effectively, 
              for those who have reached full retirement age, this repeals the 
              requirement that the beneficiary be substantially retired in order 
              to receive full Social Security retirement benefits.</font></p>
