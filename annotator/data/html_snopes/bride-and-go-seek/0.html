Tell me the tales that to me were so dear,
Long, long ago, long, long ago,
Sing me the songs I delighted to hear,
Long, long ago, long ago,
Now you are come all my grief is removed,
Let me forget that so long you have roved.
Let me believe that you love as you loved,
Long, long ago, long ago.

Do you remember the paths where we met?
Long, long ago, long, long ago.
Ah, yes, you told me you'd never forget,
Long, long ago, long ago.
Then to all others, my smile you preferred,
Love, when you spoke, gave a charm to each word.
Still my heart treasures the phrases I heard,
Long, long ago, long ago.

Tho' by your kindness my fond hopes were raised,
Long, long ago, long, long ago.
You by more eloquent lips have been praised,
Long, long ago, long, long ago,
But, by long absence your truth has been tried,
Still to your accents I listen with pride,
Blessed as I was when I sat by your side.
Long, long ago, long ago.

<b>THE MISTLETOE BOUGH<br/>
<br/>
THE MISTLETOE hung in the castle hall,<br/>
The holly branch shone on the old oak wall;<br/>
And the baron's retainers were blithe and gay,<br/>
And keeping their Christmas holiday.<br/>
The baron beheld with a father's pride<br/>
His beautiful child, young Lovell's bride;<br/>
While she with her bright eyes seemed to be<br/>
The star of the goodly company.<br/>
<br/>
'I'm weary of dancing now," she cried;<br/>
"Here, tarry a moment-I'll hide, I'll hide!<br/>
And, Lovell, be sure thou'rt first to trace<br/>
The clew to my secret lurking place."<br/>
Away she ran-and her friends began<br/>
Each tower to search, and each nook to scan;<br/>
And young Lovell cried, "O, where dost thou hide?<br/>
I'm lonesome without thee, my own dear bride."<br/>
<br/>
They sought her that night, and they sought her next day,<br/>
And they sought her in vain while a week passed away;<br/>
In the highest, the lowest, the loneliest spot,<br/>
Young Lovell sought wildly-but found her not.<br/>
And years flew by, and their grief at last<br/>
Was told as a sorrowful tale long past;<br/>
And when Lovell appeared the children cried,<br/>
"See! the old man weeps for his fairy bride."<br/>
<br/>
At length an oak chest, that had long lain hid,<br/>
Was found in the castle-they raised the lid,<br/>
And a skeleton form lay moldering there<br/>
In the bridal wreath of that lady fair!<br/>
0, sad was her fate!-in sportive jest<br/>
She hid from her lord in the old oak chest.<br/>
It closed with a spring!-and, dreadful doom,<br/>
The bride lay clasped in her living tomb!<br/><br/>
