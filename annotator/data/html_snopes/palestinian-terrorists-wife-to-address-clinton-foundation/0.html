<br/>

					Hawa Abdi Diblaawe was born in 1947 in Mogadishu, Somalia. After her mother’s death, Abdi raised her four younger sisters in conditions of poverty, yet never lost sight of her dreams. With the support of her father and a Soviet scholarship, Abdi studied medicine in Kiev and became Somalia’s first female gynecologist. She then completed a law degree at the Somali National University, where she later became an assistant professor of medicine. She opened a clinic on her family’s ancestral land in the Afgooye Corridor using the profits from the land to provide free health care. When the Somali Civil War began in 1991, Abdi started housing her employees on her land, feeding them, and caring for them. Soon after, their friends and relatives came seeking shelter, and Abdi welcomed them, providing shelter to all those who came. In 2012, Abdi’s land housed more than 90,000 refugees, mostly women and children. Today, Abdi continues to fight for the women, children, and elderly people of the Hawa Abdi Village. With the help of her daughters, Deqo and Amina, both of whom are doctors, Abdi continues to keep a candle of light lit for the people of the Afgooye Corridor. Abdi has won numerous distinctions and awards, including the John Jay Justice Award, Vital Voices’ Women of the Year Award, and a nomination for the Nobel Peace Prize in 2012.				</div>

<br/>

					Winner of the 2016 Global Teacher Prize, an initiative of the Varkey Foundation, Hanan Al Hroub grew up in the Palestinian refugee camp, Bethlehem, where she was regularly exposed to acts of violence. She went into primary education after her children were left deeply traumatized by a shooting incident they witnessed on their way home from school. Her experiences in meetings and consultations to discuss her children’s behavior, development and academic performance in the years that followed led Al Hroub to try to help others who, having grown up in similar circumstances, require special handling at school. With so many troubled children in the region, Palestinian classrooms can be tense environments. Al Hroub embraces the slogan "No to Violence" and uses a specialized teaching approach she developed herself. Al Hroub has shared her perspective at conferences, meetings and teacher training seminars.				</div>

					Muzoon Almellehan was in ninth grade when she fled Dara’a, Syria with her family in 2013. The family of five traveled to Jordan where they lived in Za’atari and Azraq refugee camps. Almellehan enrolled in the camp schools and resumed her education. Almellehan soon saw that many refugee girls — some as young as 13 and 14 — were dropping out of class and getting married. Still a girl herself, Almellehan walked from tent to tent to talk to parents about the value of education and risks of early marriage, urging them to send their daughters to school. Almellehan's determination to make sure her Syrian sisters continued in school, even in the refugee camps, won international acclaim and brought attention to refugee girls' education and early marriage. Now resettled with her family in Newcastle, United Kingdom, Almellehan continues to advocate for education and refugee girls around the world.				</div>

					Christiana Figueres was the executive secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) from 2010 to 2016. Shortyly after the unsuccessful COP15 in Copenhagen, Figueres devoted herself to rebuilding the global climate change negotiating process based on trust building, fairness, transparency, and collaboration, leading to the 2015 Paris Agreement. During Figueres’ leadership at the UNFCCC, she displayed a relentless sense of optimism and confidence. She is broadly quoted for her mantra: “Impossible is not a fact, it is an attitude.” Figueres realized that governments cannot act on climate change exclusively out of a global concern, but can be motivated by how climate protection policies and measures further national priorities and interests. She prioritized active outreach to key stakeholders beyond governments, recognizing that addressing climate change is a shared responsibility of all sectors. Due to her efforts to construct the necessary collaboration to deliver a global legally binding agreement, Figueres has been credited with forging a new brand of collaborative diplomacy. She served as minister counselor at the Embassy of Costa Rica in Germany in 1982, then returned to Costa Rica in 1987 as director of International Cooperation in the Ministry of Planning. She was director of Renewable Energy in the Americas, part of the Organization of the American States, and in 1995 founded the Center for Sustainable Development of the Americas, a non-profit organization providing capacity building in Latin America. Figueres has served on boards of non-governmental organizations and as a sustainability adviser to corporations.

Ibrahimovic is the youngest member of the Women of Srebrenica - an association fighting for the rights of the genocide survivors.

Murad immigrated to Germany where she received medical attention and reunited with other survivors. In total, she lost 18 family members. With the assistance of Yazda, a non-profit organization dedicated to helping Yazidi survivors and defending the rights of marginalized ethnic and religious minorities, Murad has been able to tell her story on the world stage, forcing world leaders to listen to the horrors of the on-going genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity.

<br/>

					Premal Shah leads Kiva.org, a website that allows individuals to lend $25 to the working poor. Since 2005, Kiva lenders have financed over 2 million low-income entrepreneurs from 85 countries, with a 97% repayment rate. The site has been named as one of Oprah's Favorite Things and a Top 50 Website by TIME magazine. Shah's inspiration for Kiva came in 2004. Working for several years at PayPal, he took two months off to volunteer in India. There he worked with low-income women to help them sell handcrafts online. While the project had mixed results, it strengthened his belief that the right combination of technology, business and love can dramatically accelerate opportunity for those most left out. Today, with a burgeoning community of 1.5 million Kiva lenders, this belief becomes more of a reality each day. For his work as a social entrepreneur, Shah was named on Fortune magazine’s Top 40 under 40 list. Shah is a graduate of Stanford University.				</div>

					The Andrea Bocelli Foundation (ABF) believes that music is the soul’s voice, because its power and beauty can open minds and develop deeper thoughts. ABF also believes that art and culture are truly a human right. ABF has launched a new project in accordance to these principles: a choir called “Voices of Haiti.” The choir is made up of 60 Haitian children aged from 9 to 15 who have gone through a highly specialized training and intense professional coaching. Through this experience, conceived from the very beginning as a structured and stable educational program, they are able to enhance their talents. The children also benefit from a wealth of educational and cultural opportunities, which opens new horizons and will be highly valuable for their future. In addition to offering a real possibility of growth and development of musical talent (an opportunity which young Haitians would normally not receive), a choir – in itself an extraordinary example of team work and dialogue, greatly needed to improve the living conditions of a country in chronic distress.				</div>
