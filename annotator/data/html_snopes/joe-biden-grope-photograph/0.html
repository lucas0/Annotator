<p>Since <em>The New York Times</em> and <em>The New Yorker</em> published bombshell reports last fall detailing decades of alleged sexual harassment and assault by producer Harvey Weinstein, dozens of women have come forward with similar claims against the movie mogul.</p>
<p>Eighty-five women have accused Weinstein of inappropriate to criminal behavior ranging from requests for massages to intimidating sexual advances to rape. Weinstein has denied the allegations.</p>
<p>"Any allegations of non-consensual sex are unequivocally denied by Mr.  Weinstein," Weinstein spokeswoman Holly Baird told USA TODAY in a statement.</p>
<p>On Thursday, multiple news outlets reported that Weinstein would turn himself in to the New York Police Department and Manhattan District Attorney's office on Friday. </p>
<p>Here is a complete (and developing) list of his accusers:</p>
<p>1. <strong>Amber Anderson</strong>, an actress known for <em>The Riot Club</em>, posted to Instagram on Oct. 16 that Weinstein “coerced” her into a private meeting. “He behaved inappropriately and propositioned a ‘personal’ relationship to further my career whilst bragging about other actresses he had ‘helped’ in a similar way,” she wrote. “He tried to take my hand and put it in his lap which is when I managed to leave the room.” </p>
<p>2. <strong>Lysette Anthony</strong>, an English model and actress of <em>Husbands and Wives</em>, told ‘The Sunday Times’ on Oct. 15 that Weinstein raped her in her home in the late 1980s. </p>
<p>3. <strong>Asia Argento</strong>, an Italian actress, model and director, told <em>The New Yorker</em> that in 1997 when she was 21, Weinstein asked for a massage and forcibly performed oral sex on her at a hotel in France. </p>
<p>4. <strong>Rosanna Arquette</strong>, 58, told <em>The New Yorker</em> she rebuffed an early 1990s advance from Weinstein, saying he asked for a massage while wearing only a bathrobe. She says the producer told her she was making a “big mistake” by rejecting him and claims he has made things “very difficult for (her) for years.” Arquette is an actress, director and producer known for her work in <em>Pulp Fiction</em> and <em>The Executioner's Song</em>. </p>
<p>5. <strong>Jessica Barth</strong>, the 37-year-old actress from the <em>Ted</em> films, told <em>The New Yorker </em>Weinstein invited her to a business meeting at his Beverly Hills hotel room after the 2011 Golden Globes. Barth later recalls he had champagne waiting, and alternated between offering to cast her in a film and demanding a naked massage. She claims that when she moved toward the door to leave, Weinstein lashed out, saying that she needs to lose weight “to compete with Mila Kunis.” </p>
<p>6. <strong>Ambra Battilana Gutierrez</strong>, an Italian model, can be heard being pressured by Weinstein in audiotapes from a New York Police Department sting in 2015. In the tapes, he seemingly admits to groping the model on the previous day. Weinstein reaches a settlement with Gutierrez, according to the <em>Times</em>. </p>

<p>7. <strong>Kate Beckinsale</strong>, 44, posted to Instagram on Oct. 12  accusing Weinstein of offering her alcohol during their first meeting when she was just 17. “I assumed it would be in a conference room which was very common,” she wrote. “When I arrived, reception told me to go to his room. He opened the door in his bathrobe.” Beckinsale is an English actress who has starred in <em>Much Ado About Nothing </em>and<em> Pearl Harbor</em>. </p>
<p>8.<strong> Juls Bindi</strong>, a massage therapist, alleged in a <em>20/20</em> interview that Weinstein  masturbated in front of her while he groped her chest in 2010. She was 29 years-old at the time and says that Weinstein discussed a possible book deal with her before the incident happened.</p>
<p>9. <strong>Zoe Brock</strong>, a New Zealand model, told <em>The Guardian</em> and wrote in a 2,700-word post on Medium that Weinstein cornered her in a hotel room during the Cannes Film Festival in 1997, asking her for a massage while he was naked. The model, who was 23 at the time, says she locked herself in a bathroom to escape. </p>
<p>10. <strong>Cynthia Burr</strong>, now 62, told the <em>New York Times</em> in an interview published Oct. 30 that as a young actress in New York, she met Weinstein in a hotel lobby and he unzipped his fly and forced her to perform oral sex on him in a hallway. “It was just him and me alone,” she said. “I was fearful I didn’t have the wherewithal to get away.”</p>
<p>11. <strong>Liza Campbell</strong>, a Scottish artist and writer, told <em>The Sunday Times</em> that Weinstein invited her to take a bath with him after meeting with him in his hotel room in 1995. </p>
<p>12. <strong>Marisa Coughlan</strong>, a 43-year-old actress who starred in <em>Super Troopers</em>, told <em>The Hollywood Reporter </em>on Oct. 18 that Weinstein asked her to meet at a hotel in 1999 to discuss a film role, alleging that, once she was there, he requested a massage from her. </p>
<p>13. <strong>Hope Exiner d’Amore</strong> worked for Weinstein’s concert promotion company, Harvey and Corky Productions, in the late ‘70s, she told the <em>Times</em>. On a business trip to New York City, she says Weinstein claimed there was a mistake at the hotel and only one room was available. In the middle of the night, Exiner d’Amore, now 62, says Weinstein forcibly performed oral sex and intercourse on her.</p>
<p>14. <strong>Florence Darel</strong>, a 49-year-old French actress, told <em>People</em> on Oct. 12 that Weinstein pursued her in the mid ‘90s and then propositioned her in a hotel room while his wife at the time, Eve Chilton, was in the room next door. Darcel starred in <em>The Stolen Children</em> and <em>Uranus</em>. </p>
<p>15. <strong>Emma de Caunes</strong>, a French actress, told <em>The New Yorker</em> that Weinstein invited her to his hotel room in Cannes in 2010. While she takes a call from a friend, he goes into his bathroom, where she hears the shower being turned on. She later says that he came out with an erection and demanded she lie on the bed. “It was like a hunter with a wild animal,” she said. “The fear turns him on.” De Caunes starred in <em>The Science of Sleep </em>and <em>Mr. Bean’s Holiday</em>.</p>
<p>16.<strong> Juliana De Paula</strong>, a former model, told the <em>Los Angeles Times</em> that Weinstein groped her and forced her to kiss other models in New York a decade ago. She added that when she tried to leave, he chased her around naked, and she had to fight him off with broken glass.</p>
<p>17. <strong>Cara Delevingne</strong>, the 25-year-old English actress and model shared in an Instagram post on Oct. 11 and in a statement to <em>New York Magazine </em>and<em> Huffington Post</em> that the movie producer attempted to kiss her in a hotel room.  "As soon as we were alone he began to brag about all the actresses he had slept with and how he had made their careers and spoke about other inappropriate things of a sexual nature," she wrote. Delevingne stars in <em>Valerian </em>and <em>Tulip Fever</em>.</p>
<p><strong style="margin-right:3px;">More: </strong>Cara Delevingne, Angelina Jolie and Gwyneth Paltrow say Weinstein harassed them, too</p>
<p>18. <strong>Sophie Dix</strong>, an English actress known for her role in <em>The Advocate</em>, told <em>The</em> <em>Guardian</em> on Oct. 13 that she was sexually assaulted by Weinstein in the Savoy hotel in London in the ‘90s.</p>
