<strong>Human Toxicity Excerpts:</strong>
<br/>
/HUMAN EXPOSURE STUDIES/ A cumulative irritancy test was used to study the effect of repeated exposure of a hair preparation containing 3.2% sodium borate and a cleansing cream containing 1.7% sodium borate on the skin of 12 and 14 subjects, respectively. The test material was applied under an occlusive patch to the backs of subjects daily for 21 consecutive days. Sites were scored one hour after patch removal. Applications 4 to 21 of the hair preparation produced erythema and papules in most subjects; the total cumulative irritancy score was 571 (maximum =630). The cleansing cream caused slight erythema in two subjects only, resulting in a total irritancy score of 6.4. The investigators concluded that, under the condition of the study, the hair preparation was a "mild to moderate" cumulative irritant, whereas the cleansing cream was practically nonirritating. /3.2% and 1.7% Sodium borate formulations/<br/><code><noindex>[Christian M, ed; J American College of Toxicology 2 (7): 87-125 (1983)] **PEER REVIEWED** </noindex></code><br/><br/>
/HUMAN EXPOSURE STUDIES/ The Kligman maximization procedure was used to study the sensitizing potential of a hair preparation containing 3.2% sodium borate in 25 subjects. The material was initially applied under a 48 hr patch to each subject to determine whether sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS) pretreatment was required. The test material was found to be irritating; it was determined that SLS treatment was unnecessary. The undiluted hair preparation was applied under occlusion to one arm of each subject for 48 hr. This procedure was repeated every other day for 10 days (5 application). 10 days after removal of the fifth induction patch, a 48 hr occlusive challenge patch was applied to a fresh site. Sites were scored at 48 and 72 hr. The hair preparation containing 3.2% sodium borate induced no irritation during challenge phases of the test; this product was determined to be nonsensitizing when applied to human skin. /3.2% Sodium borate formulation/<br/><code><noindex>[Christian M, ed; J American College of Toxicology 2 (7): 87-125 (1983)] **PEER REVIEWED** </noindex></code><br/><br/>
/HUMAN EXPOSURE STUDIES/ Two cleansing creams, each containing 1.7% sodium borate, were assayed in panel tests. In each study, panelists were given the product and asked to use it daily for 2 weeks. In a group of 100 subjects, one cream produced no irritation. In the other panel, which included 90 subjects, there was one report of irritation; a subject accidentally instilled some of the cream into her eyes. A stinging sensation was experienced; however, the irritation subsided following eye rinse. /1.7% Sodium borate formulation/<br/><code><noindex>[Christian M, ed; J American College of Toxicology 2 (7): 87-125 (1983)] **PEER REVIEWED** </noindex></code><br/><br/>

/SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS/ ... Acute oral ingestion of 2 to 20 grams or more of boric acid can result in symptoms that include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, depression of the central nervous sytem, and convulsions. Subacute or chronic doses of boric acid may result in signs and symptoms including dermatitis, loss of appetite, nausea, and vomiting. In the occupational setting, exposures to airborne boric acid and borax dusts have been shown to be irritating to the respiratory tract and the eyes of workers. These symptoms for both acute and chronic exposures, include eye irritation; dryness of mouth, nose, or throat; sore throat; and productive cough.<br/><code><noindex>[American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists.

/CASE REPORTS/ Seven patients with brain tumors who were receiving neutron-capture therapy were administered iv 18.6 to 27.3 g of sodium borate (a range of 32-50 mg/kg/of boron). In this procedure the boron served as the capture element. A consistent hypoxic type of ECG abnormality was observed immediately after the injection. When the boron was rapidly excreted or when the dose of boron was &lt;50 mg/kg, the ECG returned to normal within 24-48 hr. The researchers suggested that the entrance of boron into myocardial cells in appreciable concentrations produced injury resulting in cell hypoxia.<br/><code><noindex>[Christian M, ed; J American College of Toxicology 2 (7): 87-125 (1983)] **PEER REVIEWED** </noindex></code><br/><br/>
/CASE REPORTS/ A case-series report of seven infants (aged 6-16 weeks) who used pacifiers coated with a borax and honey mixture for 4-10 weeks concluded that exposures ranged from 12 to 90 g, with a very crudely estimated average daily ingestion of 18-56 mg of boron per kg of body weight. Toxicity was manifested by generalized or alternating focal seizure disorders, irritability, and gastrointestinal disturbances. Although infants appear to be more sensitive than adults to boron compounds, lethal doses are not well documented in the literature.<br/><code><noindex>[WHO; Boron in Drinking-water: Background document for development of WHO Guidelines for Drinking-water Quality (WHO/SDE/WSH/03.04/54).

/CASE REPORTS/ Ten patients receiving neutron-capture therapy were administered iv doses of sodium borate up to 20 g (2.12 g boron). The median dose was 25 mg/kg boron and the maximum dose was 46 mg/kg boron. The patients received 1-4 doses at intervals of 2 weeks to 3 months. The immediate symptoms were: intense gastrointestinal stimulation leading to nausea, vomiting, urgent defecation and diarrhea, "mild peripheral vascular collapse", mild mental confusion, and a flushed skin on the face. Later symptoms were: drowsiness, lethargy, and continued gastroirritability. These effects ceased by days 3-5 and no deaths occurred. Toxic effects were not enhanced by up to 4 successive iv administrations.<br/><code><noindex>[Christian M, ed; J American College of Toxicology 2 (7): 87-125 (1983)] **PEER REVIEWED** </noindex></code><br/><br/>
/CASE REPORTS/ Occupational exposure for 6 years to a soap powder containing 78.6% sodium borate resulted in hair-loss in one man. The patient was advised to avoid all contact with the soap powder, and subsequently, hair loss "subsided" and hair growth returned "more or less" to normal.<br/><code><noindex>[Christian M, ed; J American College of Toxicology 2 (7): 87-125 (1983)] **PEER REVIEWED** </noindex></code><br/><br/>
/SURVEILLANCE/ The incidence of respiratory symptoms, pulmonary function, and abnormalities of chest radiographs to estimated exposures of borax dust was studied in 629 actively employed borax workers. The subjects, who had worked in this field for at least 5 years, were interviewed to obtain information on persistent respiratory symptoms and smoking habits. Occupational histories were reviewed to assess occupational exposure, and pulmonary function tests and chest radiographs were performed. Estimated exposure ranged from 1.1 to 14.6 mg/cu m. Symptoms of acute respiratory irritation such as dryness of the mouth, nose, or throat, dry cough, nose bleeds, sore throat, productive cough, shortness of breath, and chest tightness were related to exposure of 4.0 mg/cu m or more. Symptoms of persistent respiratory irritation meeting the definition of chronic simple bronchitis were related to exposure among nonsmokers. Radiographic abnormalities were uncommon and were not related to dust exposure. /Data suggests/ that borax dust appears to act as a simple respiratory irritant.<br/><code><noindex>[Garabrant DH et al; British J Ind Med 42 (12): 831-37 (1985)] **PEER REVIEWED** </noindex></code><br/><br/>
/SURVEILLANCE/ Boric acid and sodium borates have been considered as being "toxic to reproduction and development", following results of animal studies with high doses. Experimentally, a NOAEL (no observed adverse effect level) of 17.5 mg/kg bw/day has been identified for the (male) reproductive effects of boron in a multigeneration study of rats, and a NOAEL for the developmental effects in rats was identified at 9.6 mg/kg bw/day. These values are being taken as the basis of current EU safety assessments. The present study was conducted to investigate the reproductive effects of boron exposure in workers employed in boric acid production plant in Bandirma, Turkey. In order to characterize the external and internal boron exposures, boron was determined in biological samples (blood, urine, semen), in workplace air, in food, and in water sources. Unfavorable effects of boron exposure on the reproductive toxicity indicators (concentration, motility, morphology of the sperm cells and blood levels of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), and total testosterone) were not observed. The mean calculated daily boron exposure (DBE) of the highly exposed group was 14.45 +/- 6.57 (3.32-35.62) mg/day. These human exposures represent worst-case exposure conditions to boric acid/borates in Turkey. These exposure levels are considerably lower than exposures, which have previously led to reproductive effects in experimental animals. In conclusion, this means that dose levels of boron associated with developmental and reproductive toxic effects in animals are by far not reachable for humans under conditions of normal handling and use.<br/><code><noindex>[Duydu Y et al; Arch Toxicol. 85(6):589-600 (2011)] **PEER REVIEWED** <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21424392?dopt=Abstract" target="new">PubMed Abstract</a> </noindex></code><br/><br/>
/SURVEILLANCE/ Pulmonary function studies were conducted in 1981 and 1988 at the U.S. Borax mine near Boron, CA. There were 303 participants with usable tests [forced vital capacity (FVC), and forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV )] during both time periods. Chief criteria examined were decrements in the above measures over the 7-year period between tests. Estimates were made of dust and borate exposures, based on job classifications. Analyses considered variables such as age and smoking histories. Results indicated no association between exposure and pulmonary function during the 7-year period.<br/><code><noindex>[California Environmental Protection Agency/Department of Pesticide Regulation; Toxicology Data Review Summaries.

/BIOMONITORING/ Urinary excretion levels can also be useful indicators of elevated total body burden of boron. Concentrations of boron in the normal population range from 0.07 to 0.15 mg/100 mL and 0.004 to 0.66 mg/100 mL. In one infant, the urine contained 13.9 mg boron/L as borax or 1.38 mg boron/mL of boric acid following ingestion of a borax and honey mixture over a period of 12 weeks. Virtually complete urinary excretion was indicated by the recovery of 93.9% (over a 96-hr collection period) of a boric acid solution ingested by three human volunteers.<br/><code><noindex>[DHHS/ATSDR; Toxicological Profile for Boron  (PB/93/110674/AS) (July 1992).

/GENOTOXICITY/ Peripheral blood cultures were exposed to various doses (5 to 500 mg/L) of boron compounds. Sister-chromatid exchange, micronucleus and chromosomal aberration tests were applied to estimate the DNA damage, and biochemical parameters (superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione-S-transferase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, total glutathione, malondialdehyde and total antioxidant capacity) were examined to determine oxidative stress. According to /these/ findings, various boron compounds at low doses were useful in supporting antioxidant enzyme activities in human blood cultures. It was found that the boron compounds do not have genotoxic effects even in the highest concentrations, though in increasing doses they constitute oxidative stress. It is concluded that the tested boron compounds can be used safely, but it is necessary to consider the tissue damages which are likely to appear depending on the oxidative stress.<br/><code><noindex>[Turkez H et al; Z Naturforsch C. 62(11-12):889-96 (2007)] **PEER REVIEWED** <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18274294?dopt=Abstract" target="new">PubMed Abstract</a> </noindex></code><br/><br/>
/GENOTOXICITY/ The effect of borax on human chromosomes was analyzed in this study. Venous blood from 30 male students at Thammasat University, Thailand (age 18-25 years) was collected for lymphocyte cell cultures. This experiment was divided into two groups: the first group was the control group and the second group was the experimental group. The lymphocyte cells in the control group were cultured without borax. The experimental group was divided into four subgroups. The lymphocyte cells in each experimental subgroup were cultured with different concentrations of borax (0.1 mg/mL, 0.15 mg/mL, 0.2 mg/mL and 0.3 mg/mL). Human chromosomes were studied for abnormalities through Giemsa-staining and G-banding. The results show that the numbers of metaphase plates (the metaphase plate which contained 46 chromosomes; 46, XY) and metaphase chromosomes were reduced when lymphocyte cells were cultured with 0.15 mg/mL (57.2%), 0.2 mg/mL (50.8%) and 0.3 mg/mL (42.3%) concentrations of borax. There was a statistically significant difference between the control and experimental subgroups (p &lt; 0.05). Sister chromatid separation was found in the 0.3 mg/ml borax concentration experimental subgroup. This shows that borax (at 0.15, 0.2 and 0.3 mg/mL concentrations) affects the cell and human chromosomes (both numerical and structural abnormalities). Borax may cause human chromosome abnormalities and lead to genetic defects.<br/><code><noindex>[Pongsavee M.

       have been instituted.</pre></td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top"><b>Clinical Effects:</b></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><pre>0.2.1 SUMMARY OF EXPOSURE
   0.2.1.1 ACUTE EXPOSURE
     A)  USES: Borates are used in medicated powders, lotions,
         soaps, mouthwash, toothpaste, astringents, eyewashes,
         and cosmetics. Also used as an antimicrobial to treat
         recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis. Mixed with sugar,
         boric acid has been used as a cockroach killer.
     B)  PHARMACOLOGY: Has some bacteriostatic activity.
     C)  TOXICOLOGY: Boric acid is well absorbed through the
         gastrointestinal tract, open wounds, and serous
         cavities. Toxicity has been described following
         ingestion, parenteral injection, enemas, lavage of
         serous cavities, and dermal application to burned and
         abraded skin. Systemic toxicity is more likely to occur
         following chronic or multiple exposures. Local tissue
         injury is due to caustic effects. The mechanism of
         systemic toxicity is unknown.
     D)  EPIDEMIOLOGY: Exposure is not common and severe
         toxicity is rare. Severe and fatal poisonings have
         rarely been reported following acute ingestion of boric
         acid/borates, usually following repeated dermal
         application to abraded or burned skin, or with chronic
         ingestion.
     E)  WITH POISONING/EXPOSURE
      1)  MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea,
          and skin erythema with subsequent desquamation are the
          most common effects from any route of exposure. Nausea
          and vomiting generally occur early, while dermatologic
          manifestations are delayed 3 to 5 days after exposure.
      2)  SEVERE TOXICITY: Dehydration, hypotension, CNS
          excitation or depression, lethargy, seizures, coma,
          acute renal failure, dysrhythmias, and metabolic
          acidosis have been reported in patients with severe
          toxicity.
  0.2.3 VITAL SIGNS
   0.2.3.1 ACUTE EXPOSURE
     A)  Significant ingestions or dermal exposures can be
         associated with weak, rapid pulse, cyanosis and
         hypotension. The patient may present with hypothermia,
         hyperthermia or normal body temperature.
  0.2.20 REPRODUCTIVE HAZARDS
    A)  There is insufficient information concerning the
        reproductive effects of borates in humans. However, in 1
        recent study of male workers exposed to boron, no
        unfavorable effects on reproductivity were observed.
        Adverse testicular effects and infertility have been
        reported in animals.
    B)  There have been limited animal studies which suggest
        decreased ovulation, fetotoxicity and developmental
        defects may occur with very high exposure levels.
        Maternal toxicity was present in some studies.
  0.2.22 GENOTOXICITY
    A)  The ATSDR (US DHHS, 1992) has concluded from a review of
        available studies that genotoxicity as a result of boron
        exposure may not be a human health concern. There is
        insufficient information regarding genotoxic effects of
        borates in humans. Bacterial and limited mammalian assay
        results have been negative.</pre></td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top"><b>Laboratory:</b></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><pre>A)  Monitor renal function tests, cardiovascular status, and
       fluid and electrolyte balance in symptomatic patients.
   B)  Blood borate concentrations may be useful to establish
       the diagnosis of borate intoxication, though they are not
       readily available and unlikely to be valuable for acute
       care.</pre></td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top"><b>Treatment Overview:</b></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><pre>0.4.2 ORAL EXPOSURE
    A)  SUPPORT
     1)  MANAGEMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE TOXICITY: Treatment is
         primarily supportive. Hydration, antiemetics, and
         electrolyte repletion are typically all that are
         required.
     2)  MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE TOXICITY: Supportive care with
         consideration of dialysis. For hypotension, infuse 10
         to 20 mL/kg isotonic fluid. If hypotension persists,
         administer dopamine or norepinephrine; titrate to
         desired response. For seizures, administer a
         benzodiazepine. Consider phenobarbital or propofol if
         seizures persist or recur.
    B)  DECONTAMINATION
     1)  PREHOSPITAL: Gastrointestinal decontamination is
         generally not recommended.
     2)  HOSPITAL: There are no studies that have evaluated the
         adsorption of borates to activated charcoal. As there
         is substantial gastrointestinal irritation and most
         patients will have spontaneous emesis, routine use of
         activated charcoal is not recommended.
    C)  AIRWAY MANAGEMENT
     1)  Ensure adequate ventilation and perform endotracheal
         intubation early in patients with significant CNS
         depression.
    D)  ANTIDOTE
     1)  There is no specific antidote.
    E)  ENHANCED ELIMINATION
     1)  Boric acid is removed by hemodialysis, with an
         extraction ratio of approximately 70%. Hemodialysis
         should be considered in patients with severe toxicity
         who are not responding to conventional therapy, or for
         the management of severe fluid-electrolyte
         abnormalities refractory to conventional management.
    F)  PATIENT DISPOSITION
     1)  HOME CRITERIA: Patients with inadvertent exposures with
         minimal symptoms may be observed at home.
     2)  OBSERVATION CRITERIA: Patients with deliberate exposure
         and those with more than mild symptoms (eg, persistent
         vomiting, CNS effects) should be referred to a
         healthcare facility for evaluation and treatment.
     3)  ADMISSION CRITERIA: All symptomatic patients showing
         evidence of systemic toxicity (ie, cardiovascular
         effects, acidosis, CNS effects) should be admitted.
     4)  CONSULT CRITERIA: Consult a medical toxicologist or
         local poison control center for patients with systemic
         toxicity or ongoing local tissue symptoms following
         borate exposure.
    G)  PITFALLS
     1)  Failing to recognize borate exposure as it is
         relatively rare, and failure to recognize that systemic
         poisoning may occur and produce delayed symptoms.
    H)  PHARMACOKINETICS
     1)  Boric acid is well absorbed through the
         gastrointestinal tract, open wounds, and serous
         cavities. After parenteral administration to animals,
         boric acid is distributed to all tissues, except the
         brain, within 30 minutes. Borates are primarily cleared
         unchanged by the kidney. The apparent elimination
         half-life is 5 to 10 hours.
    I)  DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS
     1)  Acutely, borate intoxication can appear similar to
         heavy metal ingestion.
  0.4.3 INHALATION EXPOSURE
    A)  Move patient to fresh air. Monitor for respiratory
        distress. If cough or difficulty breathing develops,
        evaluate for respiratory tract irritation, bronchitis,
        or pneumonitis. Administer oxygen and assist ventilation
        as required. Treat bronchospasm with inhaled beta-2
        agonist. Observe for systemic effects and administer
        supportive treatment as necessary.
  0.4.4 EYE EXPOSURE
    A)  Irrigate exposed eyes with copious amounts of room
        temperature water for at least 15 minutes. If
        irritation, pain, swelling, lacrimation, or photophobia
        persist, the patient should be seen in a healthcare
        facility.
  0.4.5 DERMAL EXPOSURE
    A)  OVERVIEW
     1)  Remove contaminated clothing and wash exposed area
         thoroughly with soap and water. A physician may need to
         examine the area if irritation or pain persists.
         Observe for systemic effects which chiefly occur from
         chronic skin exposure, or application of borates to
         denuded skin.</pre></td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top"><b>Range of Toxicity:</b></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><pre>A)  TOXICITY: The minimum lethal and maximum tolerated dose
       of ingested borates are not well established. There is
       wide variability in the response to borates. Fatalities
       occur more frequently in young children. Death has
       resulted from boric acid ingestions of 2 to 3 g in
       infants, 5 to 6 g in children, and 15 to 20 g in adults.
       There have also been reports of survival after an
       estimated 10 g ingested by a 2-year-old child, and an
       estimated 297 g ingested by an adult. There are 2.9 to
       4.4 g of boric acid in 1 teaspoonful of 100% boric acid
       powder, crystals, or granules.</pre></td></tr>

In acute poisonings, if a large amount has been ingested and the patient is seen within one hour of exposure, gastrointestinal decontamination should be considered ... .It is important to keep in mind that vomiting and diarrhea are common, and severe poisoning may be associated with seizures.

If ingestion of borate has been massive (several grams), or has extended over several days, administer intravenous glucose and electrolyte solutions to sustain urinary excretion of borate. Monitor fluid balance and serum electrolytes (including bicarbonate capacity ) regularly. Monitor cardiac status by ECG. Test the urine for proteins and cells to detect renal injury, and monitor serum concentration of borate. Metabolic acidosis may be treated with sodium bicarbonate. If shock develops, it may be necessary to infuse plasma or whole blood. Administer oxygen continuously. If oliguria (less than 25 to 30 mL urine per hour) occurs, intravenous fluids must be slowed or stopped to avoid overloading the circulation. Such patients should be referred to a center capable of providing intensive care for critically ill patients. /Boric acid and Borates/<br/><code><noindex>[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency/Office of Prevention,  Pesticides, and Toxic Substances.

If renal failure occurs, hemodialysis may be necessary to maintain fluid balance and normal extracellular fluid composition. Hemodialysis has had limited success in enhancing clearance of borates. Peritoneal dialysis has been performed in borate poisoning and is felt to be as effective as, and safer than, exchange transfusion in removing borate. No large study has been done, but it is still used somewhat less frequently than hemodialysis. /Boric acid and Borates/<br/><code><noindex>[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency/Office of Prevention,  Pesticides, and Toxic Substances.

Immediate first aid: Ensure that adequate decontamination has been carried out. If patient is not breathing, start artificial respiration, preferably with a demand-valve resuscitator, bag-valve-mask device, or pocket mask, as trained. Perform CPR as necessary. Immediately flush contaminated eyes with gently flowing water. Do not induce vomiting. If vomiting occurs, lean patient forward or place on left side (head-down position, if possible) to maintain an open airway and prevent aspiration.

/LABORATORY ANIMALS: Acute Exposure/ Boron has well-defined biological effects and may be of therapeutic benefit. In the current paper, the effect of boron in the form of borax was tested in experimental animal model of fulminant hepatic failure (FHF). The syndrome was induced in female Wistar rats by three consecutive daily intraperitoneal injections of thioacetamide (400 mg/kg). In the treatment groups, rats received borax (4.0 mg/kg) orally for three consecutive days followed by thioacetamide. The group administered with thioacetamide plus vehicle, and the borax alone treated rats served as controls. In all groups, rats were terminated 4 hr after administering the last dose of thioacetamide, and the tissue/serum was used to measure hepatic levels of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, reduced glutathione, and various enzymes associated with oxidative stress including peroxide metabolizing enzymes and xanthine oxidase. In thioacetamide treated group, many fold increase in the activity level of serum marker enzymes suggesting FHF was observed that could be brought down significantly in rats receiving boron. Modulation and a correlation in the activity level of oxidant generating enzyme and lipid peroxidation as well as hepatic glutathione level was also observed in rats receiving thioacetamide. In the group receiving boron followed by thioacetamide, these changes could be minimized moderately. The activity level of the peroxide metabolizing enzymes and the tripeptide glutathione, which decreased following thioacetamide treatment were moderately elevated in the group receiving boron followed by thioacetamide. The data clearly shows that borax partly normalizes the liver and offsets the deleterious effects observed in FHF by modulating the oxidative stress parameters.<br/><code><noindex>[Pawa S et al; Chem Biol Interact. 160(2):89-98 (2006)] **PEER REVIEWED** <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16442087?dopt=Abstract" target="new">PubMed Abstract</a> </noindex></code><br/><br/>
/LABORATORY ANIMALS: Acute Exposure/  The dermal irritation potential of borax and boric acid was studied. Ten mL of 5% aqueous boric acid (17.5 g B/L) were applied under occlusion to the clipped, intact and abraded skin of rabbits and guinea pigs. Sites were scored for irritation at 24 and 72 hours. Both borax and boric acid were found to be mild to moderate irritants.<br/><code><noindex>[Roudabush RL, et al Toxicol Appl Pharmacol 7: 559-65 (1965) as cited in USEPA; Health Advisory for Boron (Draft) p.8 (1988)] **PEER REVIEWED** </noindex></code><br/><br/>
/LABORATORY ANIMALS: Acute Exposure/ Sodium borate was administered ip to mice and the animals were observed for 5-12 days. ...Convulsions usually occurred within 3 hr.

/LABORATORY ANIMALS: Acute Exposure/ The acute oral toxicity of a hair preparation containing 3.2% sodium borate was determined in male and female albino rats. The test solution was administered by intubation to groups of 10 rats at doses of 8.72-17.4 g/kg. Animals were observed for 14 days, sacrificed, and were necropsied as were the animals that died during the study. The acute oral LD50 of the hair preparation was 14.1 g/kg ... . Results of necropsy revealed the following abnormalities that may have been caused by ingestion of the test material (especially at highest doses): melanuria, diarrhea, polyuria, discolored stomach and intestinal mucosa, discolored gastrointestinal contents, empty urinary bladder, dilated renal pelvis, and testes drawn into the abdominal cavity. /3.2% Sodium borate formulation/<br/><code><noindex>[Christian M, ed; J American College of Toxicology 2 (7): 87-125 (1983)] **PEER REVIEWED** </noindex></code><br/><br/>
/LABORATORY ANIMALS: Subchronic or Prechronic Exposure/ The aims of this study were to clarify the effects of high dietary supplementation with boric acid and borax, called boron (B) compounds, on lipid peroxidation (LPO), antioxidant activity, some vitamin levels, and DNA damage in rats. Thirty Sprague Dawley male rats were divided into three equal groups: the animals in the first group (control) were fed with a standard rodent diet containing 6.4 mg/kg /boron/, and the animals in the experimental group were fed with a standard rodent diet added with a supra-nutritional amount of boric acid and borax (100 mg/kg /boron/) throughout the experimental period of 28 days. The B compounds decreased malondialdehyde (MDA), DNA damage, the protein carbonyl content (PCO) level in blood, and glutathione (GSH) concentration in the liver, Cu-Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase (CAT) activity in the kidney. The B compounds increased GSH concentration in blood and the vitamin C level in plasma. Consequently, our results demonstrate that B supplementation (100 mg/kg) in diet decreases LPO, and enhances the antioxidant defense mechanism and vitamin status. There are no differences in oxidant/antioxidant balance and biochemical parameters except for serum vitamin A and liver GSH concentration, between the boron compounds used in this study.<br/><code><noindex>[Ince S et al; J Trace Elem Med Biol. 24(3):161-4 (2010)] **PEER REVIEWED** <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20569927?dopt=Abstract" target="new">PubMed Abstract</a> </noindex></code><br/><br/>

/LABORATORY ANIMALS: Subchronic or Prechronic Exposure/ A diet of borax or boric acid was administered to Sprague Dawley rats (10/sex/dose) for 90 days at doses of 0, 52.5, 175, 525, 1,750 or 5,250 ppm as boron equivalents. Both borax and boric acid produced 100% mortality at the highest dose and complete atrophy of the testes in all males fed diets containing 1,750 ppm boron equivalent. At 1,750 ppm boron, both compounds produced significant decreases in body weight and in the mean weights of the liver, kidney, spleen, and testes. At lower doses, changes in organ weights were inconsistent.

The toxicological end points of concern identified for both boric-acid and borax from animal studies were fertility and developmental toxicity. The lowest no observed adverse effect level for fertility in male and female rats was 17mg/kg boron (7440428) for both boric-acid and borax. Effects observed at the low observed adverse effect level included testicular toxicity, reduced spermiation in males and decreased ovulation in females. Testicular atrophy was noted at higher doses. Only boric-acid data was available for developmental toxicity from rat, mouse, and rabbit studies. The most sensitive species was the rat with a no observed adverse effect level of 0.5mg/kg boron, based on reduced fetal body weight and skeletal effects. A tolerable daily intake of borates for a 60 kilogram person was calculated to be 34 milligrams (mg) boron/day and 19.2mg boron/day which could be ingested without the risk of fertility or developmental effects, respectively.

/OTHER TOXICITY INFORMATION/ Based on the inhibition effect on the respiratory chain activity of microorganisms by toxicants, an electrochemical method has been developed to measure the current variation of a mediator in the presence of microorganisms contacted with a toxicant. Microelectrode arrays were adopted in this study, which can accelerate the mass transfer rate of an analyte to the electrode and also increase the total current signal, resulting in an improvement in detection sensitivity. /The authors/ selected Escherichia coli as the testee and the standard glucose-glutamic acid as an exogenous material. Under oxygen restriction, the experiments in the presence of toxicant were performed at optimum conditions (solution pH 7.0, 37 degrees C and reaction for 3 hr). The resulting solution was then separated from the suspended microorganisms and was measured by an electrochemical method, using ferricyanide as a mediator. The current signal obtained represents the reoxidation of ferrocyanide, which was transformed to inhibiting efficiency, IC50, as a quantitative measure of toxicity. The IC50 values measured were 410, 570 and 830 mg/L for sodium nitrite, borax and aluminum potassium sulfate, respectively. The results show that the toxicity sequence for these three food additives is consistent with the value reported by other methods. Furthermore, the order of damage degree to the microorganism was also observed to be: sodium nitrite &gt; borax &gt; aluminum potassium sulfate &gt; blank, according to the atomic force microscopy images of E. coli after being incubated for 3 hr with the toxic compound in buffer solutions. The electrochemical method is expected to be a sensitive and simple alternative to toxicity screening for chemical food additives.<br/><code><noindex>[Yu D et al; J Environ Sci (China). 25(4):785-90 (2013)] **PEER REVIEWED** <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23923788?dopt=Abstract" target="new">PubMed Abstract</a> </noindex></code><br/><br/>

/OTHER TOXICITY INFORMATION/  Urban ants are a worldwide critical household pests, and efforts to control them usually involve the use of alimentary baits containing slow-acting insecticides. A common toxicant used is boron, either as borax or boric acid. However, the presence of these compounds can affect the consumption of baits by reducing their acceptance and ingestion. Moreover, as feeding motivation varies widely, according not only to food properties but also to colony conditions, bait consumption might be diminished further in certain situations. In this study, ... the feeding response of ants toward two boron toxic baits (boric acid and borax) in low motivation situations that enhance any possible phago-deterrence the baits may produce /were compared/. Most studies investigating bait ingestion evaluate whole nests or groups of ants; here, /they/ analyzed the individual ingestion behavior and mortality of the Argentine ant, Linepithema humile (Mayr), and the carpenter ant, Camponotus mus (Roger), for two boron baits, to detect which compound generates a higher rejection in each of these species. Although these two species have similar feeding habits, /these/ results showed that ants under low motivation conditions reduced the acceptance and consumption of the toxic baits asymmetrically. While L. humile mostly rejected the borax, C. mus rejected the boric acid. These results denote the importance of considering the preference of each species when developing a pest management strategy.<br/><code><noindex>[Sola F et al; J Econ Entomol. 106(2):929-38 (2013)] **PEER REVIEWED** <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23786084?dopt=Abstract" target="new">PubMed Abstract</a> </noindex></code><br/><br/>
/OTHER TOXICITY INFORMATION/ Total boron concentrations in Drosophila changed during development and aging. The highest concentration of boron was found during the egg stage, followed by a decline during the larval stages. Newly emerged flies contained 35.5 ppm boron. During the adult stage the boron concentration increased by 52% by 9 weeks of age. Adding excess dietary boron during the adult stage decreased the median life span by 69% at 0.01 M sodium borate and by 21% at 0.001 M sodium borate. Lower concentrations gave small but significant increases in life span. Supplementing a very low boron diet with 0.00025 M sodium borate improved life span by 9.5%. The boron contents of young and old mouse tissues were similar to those of Drosophila and human samples. Boron supplements of 4.3 and 21.6 ppm in the drinking water, however, did not significantly change the life span of old mice fed a diet containing 31.1 ppm boron<br/><code><noindex>[Massie HR; Environ Health Perspec 102 (Supp;7): 45-48 (1994)] **PEER REVIEWED** </noindex></code><br/><br/>

Borax (CAS No. 1303-96-4) was evaluated for the potential to induce eye irritation in New Zealand White rabbits. Six young adult rabbits were administered 0.1 g of the test article into 1 eye by gently pulling the lower lid away from the eyeball to form a cup into which the material was instilled. The lids were then held together for second. The untreated eye in each animal served as control. The eyes were examined at 1, 24, 48, and 72 hours post-treatment and scored against the Draize Scale for Ocular Lesions. Mean irritation scores ranged from 34.5 at the 24 hours examination to 20.7 at the 72 hours examination. One animal exhibited slow and incomplete recovery by 21 days post-treatment.

<strong>Environmental Fate/Exposure Summary:</strong>
<br/>
Borax production and use in soldering metals, manufacture of glazes and enamels, tanning, curing and preserving skins, buffers, as a complexing or masking agent in analytical chemistry, fireproofing fabrics and as a pharmaceutic aid (alkalizer) may result in its release to the enviornment through various waste streams. Its use as in cleaning compounds, artificially aging wood, as a preservative, either alone or with other antiseptics against wood fungus, fireproofing wood, in cockroach control, use in ant poisons, and for fly control around refuse and manure piles as a larvicide will result in its direct release to the environment. Boron is naturally occurring and ubiquitous in the environment. The most common boron containing ores are alkali and alkaline earth borates, including borax (Na4B4O2.10H2O), kernite (Na2B4O7.4H2O), colemanite (Ca2B6O11.5H2O), and ulexite (NaCaB5O9.8H2O), and as borosilicate minerals. Boron containing minerals are concentrated in arid regions, such as Turkey and California's Death Valley. Borax is stable to photolysis. Disappearance from soil is by washing out. Persistence in soil is about 2 years, depending on rainfall and soil structure. Borax does not biodegrade. Borax is stable to hydrolysis. Monitoring and use data indicate that the general population may be exposed to borax via dermal contact with this compound via consumer products containing borax.

<strong>FIFRA Requirements:</strong>
<br/>
An exemption from the requirement of a tolerance is established for residues of the pesticidal chemical boric acid and its salts, borax (sodium borate decahydrate), disodium octaborate tetrahydrate, boric oxide (boric anhydride), sodium borate and sodium metaborate, in or on raw agricultural commodities when used as an active ingredient in insecticides, herbicides, or fungicides preharvest or postharvest in accordance with good agricultural practices.<br/><code><noindex>[40 CFR 180.1121 (USEPA); U.S. National Archives and Records Administration's Electronic Code of Federal Regulations.

The Agency has reassessed the current exemptions from the requirement for tolerances from boric acid/sodium borate salts (see Table 6 for tolerance exemptions). As a result of this assessment, the Agency determined that the active tolerances exemptions should be maintained and are considered reassessed as safe under section 408(q) of the FFDCA. It should be noted however that the higher application rates for the swimming pool uses resulted in residential post-application scenarios which exceed the Agency's LOC. The high rates for these pool and spa uses must be deleted from the end-use product labels. Registrants have agreed to amend their labels by removing the higher application rates to Agency acceptable levels. Taking into consideration the available information on all uses; including the inert ingredient uses, of boric acid, sodium metaborate, and sodium tetraborate, there is a reasonable certainty that no harm to any population subgroup will result from aggregate exposure when considering dietary exposure and all other remaining non-occupational sources of pesticide exposure for which there is reliable information. Therefore, the three exemptions from the requirement of a tolerance established for residues of boric acid, sodium metraborate, and sodium tetraborate in/on raw agricultural commodities under 40 CFR 180.920 and the exemptions for tolerances established for the boric acid/sodium borate salts under 40 CFR section180.1121 are considered reassessed as safe under section 408(q) of the FFDCA.<br/><code><noindex>[USEPA/Office of Prevention, Pesticides and Toxic Substances; Report of the Food Quality Protection Act (FQPA) Tolerance Reassessment Eligibility Decision (TRED) for Boric Acid/Sodium Borate Salts p.11 (July 2006).

Based on the reviews of the generic data for the active ingredients of boric acid and its sodium salts, the Agency has sufficient information on the health effects of boric acid and its sodium salts and their potential for causing adverse effects in fish and wildlife and the environment. Therefore, the Agency concludes that products containing boric acid and its sodium salts for all uses are eligible for reregistration. The Agency has determined that boric acid and its sodium salts, labeled and used as specified in the RED document, will not pose unreasonable risks or adverse effects to humans or the environment.<br/><code><noindex>[USEPA/Office of Prevention, Pesticides and Toxic Substances; Reregistration Eligibility Decision Document - Boric Acid and its Sodium Salts p.34 (September 1993).

As the federal pesticide law FIFRA directs, EPA is conducting a comprehensive review of older pesticides to consider their health and environmental effects and make decisions about their continued use. Under this pesticide reregistration program, EPA examines newer health and safety data for pesticide active ingredients initially registered before November 1, 1984, and determines whether the use of the pesticide does not pose unreasonable risk in accordance to newer safety standards, such as those described in the Food Quality Protection Act of 1996. Borax is found on List A, which contains most pesticides that are used on foods and, hence, have a high potential for human exposure. List A consists of the 194 chemical cases (or 350 individual active ingredients) for which EPA issued registration standards prior to FIFRA '88. Case No: 0024; Pesticide type: insecticide, fungicide herbicide; Registration Standard Date: 11/01/85; Case Status: RED Approved 9/93; OPP has made a decision that some/all uses of the pesticide are eligible for reregistration, as reflected in a Reregistration Eligibility Decision (RED) document.; Active ingredient (AI): borax; Data Call-in (DCI) Date(s): 2/16/94; AI Status: OPP has completed a Reregistration Eligibility Decision (RED) for the case/AI.<br/><code><noindex>[United States Environmental Protection Agency/ Prevention,  Pesticides and Toxic Substances; Status of Pesticides in  Registration, Reregistration, and Special Review.

<strong>Preventive Measures:</strong>
<br/>
SRP: Contaminated protective clothing should be segregated in such a manner so that there is no direct personal contact by personnel who handle, dispose, or clean the clothing. Quality assurance to ascertain the completeness of the cleaning procedures should be implemented before the decontaminated protective clothing is returned for reuse by the workers. Contaminated clothing should not be taken home at end of shift, but should remain at employee's place of work for cleaning.<br/><code><noindex> **PEER REVIEWED** </noindex></code><br/><br/>

SRP: The scientific literature for the use of contact lenses by industrial workers is inconsistent. The benefits or detrimental effects of wearing contact lenses depend not only upon the substance, but also on factors including the form of the substance, characteristics and duration of the exposure, the uses of other eye protection equipment, and the hygiene of the lenses. However, there may be individual substances whose irritating or corrosive properties are such that the wearing of contact lenses would be harmful to the eye. In those specific cases, contact lenses should not be worn. In any event, the usual eye protection equipment should be worn even when contact lenses are in place.<br/><code><noindex> **PEER REVIEWED** </noindex></code><br/><br/>

<strong>Disposal Methods:</strong>
<br/>
SRP: The most favorable course of action is to use an alternative chemical product with less inherent propensity for occupational harm/injury/toxicity or environmental contamination. Recycle any unused portion of the material for its approved use or return it to the manufacturer or supplier. Ultimate disposal of the chemical must consider: the material's impact on air quality; potential migration in soil or water; effects on animal and plant life; and conformance with environmental and public health regulations.<br/><code><noindex> **PEER REVIEWED** </noindex></code><br/><br/>
SRP: Wastewater from contaminant suppression, cleaning of protective clothing/equipment, or  contaminated sites should be contained and evaluated for subject chemical or decomposition  product concentrations. Concentrations shall be lower than applicable environmental  discharge or disposal criteria. Alternatively, pretreatment and/or discharge to a permitted  wastewater treatment facility is acceptable only after review by the governing authority and  assurance that "pass through" violations will not occur. Due consideration shall be given to  remediation worker exposure (inhalation, dermal and ingestion) as well as fate during  treatment, transfer and disposal. If it is not practicable to manage the chemical in this  fashion, it must be evaluated in accordance with EPA 40 CFR Part 261, specifically Subpart  B, in order to determine the appropriate local, state and federal requirements for disposal.<br/><code><noindex> **PEER REVIEWED** </noindex></code><br/><br/>

Borax has been used as a laundry additive since about 1900. It can contribute to the softening of hard water by tying up calcium ions, as well as acting as a buffer agent. A traditional use as a sweetening agent for diaper pails is thought to involve the borate inhibition of the urease enzyme, (preventing ammonia formation). The same effect has been patented for deodorizing animal litter.

<strong>Methods of Manufacturing:</strong>
<br/>
Processing of sodium borate ores by crushing, heating, mechanical separation, selective crystallization, and finally flotation of borax decahydrate or pentahydrate from the resultant concentrated borax liquor<br/><code><noindex>[SRI] **PEER REVIEWED** </noindex></code><br/><br/>
Disodium tetraborate (borax) containing 5 or 10 molecules of water is produced mainly from sodium-containing borate ores. The mined ore is crushed and ground before dissolution in a hot recycled aqueous solution containing some borax. Insoluble gangue (clay particles) present in the hot slurry is separated off to produce a clear concentrated borax solution. Evaporative cooling of this solution to selected temperatures results in crystallization of the desired products, which are then separated from the residual liquor and dried. /Borax/<br/><code><noindex>[WHO; Environmental Health Criteria Document No. 204 (1998): Boron (7740-42-8) p. 18.

Borates were known before Babylonian times to be useful as a flux for welding gold and have been found in enamels from China as early as 300 B.C. At the end of the 13th century Marco Polo brought borax from Mongolia to Europe. This became the primary European source for use as a soldering and aneameling agent.<br/><code><noindex>[Smith RA; Boric Oxide, Boric Acid, and Borates.

USEPA/Office of Prevention, Pesticides and Toxic Substances; Report of the Food Quality Protection Act (FQPA) Tolerance Reassessment Eligibility Decision (TRED) for Boric Acid/Sodium Borate Salts (July 2006). EPA issues a TRED for a pesticide that requires tolerance reassessment decisions, but does not require a reregistration eligibility decision at present because: the pesticide was initially registered after November 1, 1984, and by law is not included within the scope of the reregistration program; EPA completed a RED for the pesticide before FQPA was enacted on August 3, 1996; or the pesticide is not registered for use in the U.S. but tolerances are established that allow crops treated with the pesticide to be imported from other countries.<br/><code><noindex>[Available from, as of February 21, 2014: <a href="http://www.epa.gov/pesticides/reregistration/status.htm" target="new">http://www.epa.gov/pesticides/reregistration/status.htm</a> </noindex></code><br/><br/>
