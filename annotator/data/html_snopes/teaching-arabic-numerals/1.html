<h3 class="about-us__headline">Our Story</h3>
<p><strong>We’re on a mission to power the world’s opinions and bring them to the decision makers who care.<br/>
</strong><br/>
In 2007, CivicScience emerged from the vision of founder and CEO John Dick that market research and opinion-gathering needed a new solution. Consumer and public-oriented businesses that had long relied on traditional polling and survey techniques found those methods were growing tired and less effective in reaching a representative audience. The emergence of social media sharing brought convenience and immediacy of the public’s voice to the table, but also inherent biases and untrustworthy information.</p>
<p>Our ambitious goal was to develop a revolutionary new way to connect the real-time opinions of consumers to the decision makers who need that information every day – but to do so with depth, breadth, and reliability.</p>
<p>With that vision, a small financial grant, and incubator space in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, we built our first polling website in early 2008 and, through extensive experimentation, database engineering, and software development, created what is now the fastest, most sophisticated, and most democratic polling solution ever invented. Today, we provide software and services to the world’s leading brands media companies, and investors, while giving a trusted and powerful voice to all people.</p>
