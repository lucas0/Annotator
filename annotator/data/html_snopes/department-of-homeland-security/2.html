<font color="#000000" face="Verdana, sans-serif"><font size="2">From the 
    very day the first Arab immigrant stepped foot on American soil in the early 
    19th Century, Arabs in America have been misunderstood.</font></font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
<font color="#000000" face="Verdana, sans-serif"><font size="2">In 1980, a 
    group of concerned Arab American professionals launched what would quickly 
    become the largest and most important grassroots Arab American organization 
    in the country, to help correct the stereotypes and assist immigrants from 
    the Arab World adjust to this great country.</font></font></p>

    as the organization prepares to celebrate its 25th anniversary as the 
    nation's most important advocate for Arab and Muslim civil rights, two of 
    ADC's professional staff spoke about how much more acute the challenges 
    facing Arabs in America have become in the wake of the terrorism of Sept. 
    11th.</font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">

    TheArabStreet.com spoke with two of the professionals guiding ADC's national 
    policies as they address the new challenges facing Arab Americans in the 
    post-Sept. 11th world.</font></font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
<font color="#000000" face="Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Kareem W. 
    Shora</b>, JD, LLM is Director of Legal Policy with ADC. He has been with ADC as 
    Legal Advisor since 2000 before being named Director of Legal Policy in 
    2004. </font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
<font color="#000000" face="Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Laila Al-Qatami
    </b>is the Communications Director for ADC. She joined the staff of ADC in 
    October 2000 and currently is ADC's official spokesperson, succeeding former 
    ADC spokesman Hussein Ibish in July 2004.</font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
<font color="#000000" face="Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">
<img align="right" border="0" height="238" src="http://web.archive.org/web/web/20091112190254im_/http://www.themediaoasis.com/theArabStreet/interviews/LailaAl-Qatami.jpg" width="268"/></font><font color="#000000" face="Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">"Clearly, 
    the work we do at ADC has changed both in the way ADC operates and in the 
    way ADC approaches challenges. The priorities have definitely changed and 
    directly as a result of September 11," said Shora, 31.</font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
<font color="#000000" face="Verdana, sans-serif"><font size="2">"The most 
    striking change is the way the organization has matured. Obviously Sept. 11 
    has had a lot to do with that change. But it has matured in the way it 
    addresses the challenges and the way it works with other organizations. The 
    effectiveness and impact of the organization has improved tremendously. And 
    the challenges we address have increased measurably."</font></font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
<font color="#000000" face="Verdana, sans-serif"><font size="2">Shora said 
    that ADC now works in the context of coalitions. "One hand doesn't clap. The 
    more hands that clap, the louder we are heard."</font></font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
<font color="#000000" face="Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">
    "There 
    was a challenge before but September 11 really put us under a microscope, 
    and I am speaking as broadly as possible as an Arab American, Middle East 
    American and Muslim American community. We had no choice but to mature, 
    improve and address these issues and challenges as effectively we can," 
    Shora said.</font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
<font color="#000000" face="Verdana, sans-serif"><font size="2">In part, 
    ADC's voice is augmented by a professional communications staff. Not only 
    does ADC address civil rights issues, but they also coordinate their 
    activities with a professional communications staff that in the Arab 
    American community and the Arab World, is one of the best and most 
    effective.</font></font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
<font color="#000000" face="Verdana, sans-serif"><font size="2">"What 
    happened after Sept. 11 at the ADC office was that the phones started 
    ringing off the hook," recalled Al-Qatami, 34.</font></font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
<font color="#000000" face="Verdana, sans-serif"><font size="2">"And, when I 
    say the phone was ringing off the hook, I'm not talking about just in terms 
    of communications inquiries, but across the board. We had so many Arab 
    Americans and Americans of other ethnicities calling and asking for 
    assistance. People were calling and asking for general information about the 
    Arab and Muslim community. Many said they didn't know about us and asked if 
    ADC could help teach them about the community. ADC immediately responded 
    with several new programs and initiatives to deal with this new environment. 
    I should note also that ADC's services are open to all as is our membership. 
    We welcome members of all faiths, backgrounds, and ethnicities."</font></font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
<font color="#000000" face="Verdana, sans-serif"><font size="2">Al-Qatami 
    said that in addition to writing and speaking out on high profile 
    controversial issues, responding to media inquiries and representing or 
    arranging for an ADC spokesman to participate in media interviews, Al-Qatami 
    said the organization has launched several new initiatives to speak to the 
    new concerns.</font></font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
<font color="#000000" face="Verdana, sans-serif"><font size="2">"We hired a 
    few people to just go out and talk. People sent out to provide basic 
    information about the Arab American community. That program has really taken 
    off," Al-Qatami said.</font></font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
<font color="#000000" face="Verdana, sans-serif"><font size="2">"We also 
    offer diversity training for all kinds of people, at schools, for law 
    enforcement, and for other government and public agencies. We realized how 
    important it was to also get out and help educate and train the American 
    public. One on one, we had to help change people's ideas and the mindset out 
    there about our community."</font></font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
<font color="#000000" face="Verdana, sans-serif"><font size="2">September 11 
    helped define for Al-Qatami how fundamental and basic the challenges were.</font></font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
<font color="#000000" face="Verdana, sans-serif"><font size="2">"On Sept. 
    11, I was watching the news here at the office. It must have been about 
    10:30 at the time, and someone called and was making threats, saying they 
    knew we had done this and they were going to get us," Al-Qatami said.</font></font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
<font color="#000000" face="Verdana, sans-serif"><font size="2">"But, we 
    also received a phone call from the (Washington D.C.) police chief, Charles 
    Ramsey. And it was a bit frightening. He said we might need some 
    assistance and support and he offered to help. I mean, everyone here in the 
    US and around the world was shocked that something like this could happen."</font></font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
<font color="#000000" face="Verdana, sans-serif"><font size="2">Al-Qatami 
    said that the inquiries continued to increase.</font></font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
<font color="#000000" face="Verdana, sans-serif"><font size="2">"The next 
    day and for many months afterwards, the phone was ringing off the hook. I 
    thought it would be more of the same, but it turned out that many were 
    people calling and asking for basic information about the Arab American and 
    Muslim community. It wasn't just calls from the average Americans looking to 
    understand, but also from the media," she said.</font></font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
<font color="#000000" face="Verdana, sans-serif"><font size="2">What 
    surprised Al-Qatami wasn't the level of the anger, but the lack of 
    information, especially by the news media which conveys information to the 
    American public.</font></font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
<font color="#000000" face="Verdana, sans-serif"><font size="2">"I was 
    really a bit shocked that the media didn't seem to know the basic and 
    fundamental issues about the Arab community. It was almost like they were 
    calling to get a primer on the Arab community and I wondered why they didn't 
    know it already. BUT I saw this as an opportunity for me to help them better 
    understand and maybe even correct some misconceptions out there," Al-Qatami 
    said.</font></font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
<font color="#000000" face="Verdana, sans-serif"><font size="2">Al-Qatami 
    said that not long after September 11, she received a telephone call from a 
    producer working for an ABC prime time news program.</font></font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
<font color="#000000" face="Verdana, sans-serif"><font size="2">"She was a 
    senior producer and she said she was doing a story on 'Ay-rabs' and she said 
    that she understood that ADC works with 'Ay-rabs.' I was surprised and I 
    said that we don't refer to people in the community as 'Ay-rabs.' It was 
    such a fundamental issue and an example of how bad things were not just in 
    American society but in a news organization that is supposed to be one of 
    the nation's most influential. The whole time she was speaking, she had to 
    mentally correct herself. There are fundamental terms that are not 
    interchangeable. They don't understand the basics of the Arab World or the 
    Muslim World ... how can they do the job they are supposed to do when they 
    don't even have the basics down?"</font></font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
<font color="#000000" face="Verdana, sans-serif"><font size="2">Al-Qatami 
    also said that as a woman, she was constantly confronting negative 
    stereotypes about women in the Arab World.</font></font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
<font color="#000000" face="Verdana, sans-serif"><font size="2">"Reporters 
    would say such ridiculous things like, 'My, you speak so freely for an Arab 
    Woman. I bet you can't go back to your country.' My father happens to be 
    Kuwaiti and I would explain that I don't have problems like that at all as 
    an Arab woman. I am continually surprised by the things that people ask me."</font></font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
<font color="#000000" face="Verdana, sans-serif"><font size="2">But Al-Qatami 
    said that despite the lack of information and knowledge, the stereotypes and 
    incorrect perceptions, she is always encouraged when they are changed.</font></font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
<font color="#000000" face="Verdana, sans-serif"><font size="2">"Another 
    issue, especially in the news media, is that there is a pervasive problem 
    with people trying to define who we are, rather than seeing us for who we 
    are," Al-Qatami said.</font></font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
<font color="#000000" face="Verdana, sans-serif"><font size="2">She cited 
    the common practice of many government and public agencies to invite people 
    like Daniel Pipes, who is a well known and notorious anti-Arab and 
    anti-Muslim speaker who asserts a knowledge of Arabs and Muslims that is 
    based on stereotypes, racism and inaccurate information.</font></font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
<font color="#000000" face="Verdana, sans-serif"><font size="2">"He's 
    invited to testify before congress and other agencies and he propagates 
    stereotypes and misinformation which encourages others to be fearful of the 
    community at large. One of our challenges is that we must reach the point 
    where we can define ourselves accurately and fully, not just for our own 
    benefit but for the benefit of the American people, too. I think this is 
    happening, but not to the extent that it should."</font></font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
<font color="#000000" face="Verdana, sans-serif"><font size="2">Shora said 
    the world changed almost overnight. Prior to Sept. 11, Shora said ADC was 
    working with the Department of Transportation on issues involving airport 
    profiling.</font></font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
<font color="#000000" face="Verdana, sans-serif"><font size="2">"About one 
    month before, the U.S. Department of Transportation had announced they were 
    looking into determining if a new computer system they were using was 
    impacting Arab Americans and Muslims more so than others. They were going to 
    spend $1 million on the study," Shora said.</font></font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
<font color="#000000" face="Verdana, sans-serif"><font size="2">"On Sept. 
    12, we were in a completely different world. The project was dropped. And 
    our immediate concern shifted to a new priority. What do we tell our 
    community. What do we tell them so they can better prepare for what was 
    becoming an enormous backlash against them? We knew the backlash was coming. 
    How do we help prepare them? People were being harassed and we needed to 
    make sure that the community knew how to protect itself."</font></font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
<font color="#000000" face="Verdana, sans-serif"><font size="2">But Shora 
    said the discrimination and civil rights challenges weren't just coming from 
    the general public angered at Arabs and Muslims. </font></font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
<font color="#000000" face="Verdana, sans-serif" size="2">"After the 
    initial wave of hate-motivated crimes, The first thing we noticed was the 
    official discrimination coming from the government, and especially from the 
    office of U.S. Attorney General John Ashcroft. This discrimination began 
    long before the Patriot Act was adopted. Mr. Ashcroft had implemented a new, 
    voluntary interview program that targeted business people, tourists, 
    students and others for voluntary interviews. It turned out that was the 
    first inherently discriminatory act that occurred post Sept. 11," Shora 
    explained.</font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
<font color="#000000" face="Verdana, sans-serif"><font size="2">"That was 
    followed by a special registration program and the mis-implementation of all 
    those programs. What we saw take place was that the government and 
    politicians were making the decisions to create these programs, but they 
    were not allocating the necessary resources to properly implement them or 
    what they said they were implementing. In the end, the MIS-implementation 
    went far beyond what we feared in terms of civil rights violations."</font></font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
<font color="#000000" face="Verdana, sans-serif"><font size="2">"There also 
    was a grave failure in publicizing these programs. If a person didn't know 
    about the programs or the need to register in a program, for example, the 
    person could be deported and for no fault of their own," Al-Qatami said.</font></font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
<font color="#000000" face="Verdana, sans-serif"><font size="2">Many of the 
    problems had less to do with security risks or terrorist activity, and more 
    with the failure of the people implementing those programs to understand 
    what they were dealing with in terms of the Arab or Muslim American 
    community.</font></font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
<font color="#000000" face="Verdana, sans-serif"><font size="2">"They just 
    didn't understand and the confusion caused more problems than they solved," 
    said Shora.</font></font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
<font color="#000000" face="Verdana, sans-serif"><font size="2">Initially, 
    the government announced a "Special Registration" program that targeted 
    nationals from 25 countries, 24 of which were Muslim or Arab countries and 
    the 25th was North Korea.</font></font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
<font color="#000000" face="Verdana, sans-serif"><font size="2">"They also 
    originally included Armenia, but that was withdrawn," Al-Qatami noted.</font></font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
<font color="#000000" face="Verdana, sans-serif"><font size="2">"The problem 
    was the program was discriminatory. We are a nation at war. At war with an 
    enemy that has no boundaries. It had no country. We were not IN a war 
    against Islam, as the president clarified many times. But these programs 
    demonstrated that the government, or at least the administration, was acting 
    as if they were. Why would you ask all nationals of those specific countries 
    to be scrutinized when we saw many examples of others posing threats or 
    being allegedly involved in terrorism like Richard Reid or Jose Padilla, for 
    example? They were saying that people from those 25 countries were suspects, 
    one way or another. All they were doing was stereotyping the War on 
    Terrorism as being focused on Muslims and Arabs."</font></font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
<font color="#000000" face="Verdana, sans-serif"><font size="2">Shora 
    provided the example of how the officials implementing the Special 
    Registration program did not even understand the scope of what their program 
    involved because they simply did not understand the basic issues and were 
    confused about facts.</font></font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
<font color="#000000" face="Verdana, sans-serif"><font size="2">"We got a 
    call from a man who said he was Lebanese and lived in New York City. He said 
    he had a brother who is Palestinian, but he carried a refugee travel 
    document on an F1 student visa. He said he understood that the deadlines 
    were passing for Lebanese citizens to voluntarily register and wanted to 
    know what his brother, who was Palestinian, should do. The fact is, the 
    special registration did not mention Palestinians or Palestine," Shora said.</font></font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
<font color="#000000" face="Verdana, sans-serif"><font size="2">"When he 
    called the INS, the INS official who answered the phone said she didn't care 
    whether his brother is Palestinian because they didn't care about a person's 
    religion. This is a person who is supposed to be managing a program who 
    thought that 'Palestinian' was a religion. To us, that highlighted the lack 
    of knowledge that was out there and how important it was for ADC to step 
    back and start a new program. The information that was misunderstood was so 
    basic. We initiated an outreach program to re-educate our law enforcement 
    officials on basic programs, issues and understandings on the Middle East, 
    Arab Americans, the Arab World and the Muslim community."</font></font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
<font color="#000000" face="Verdana, sans-serif"><font size="2">Al-Qatami 
    said that ADC immediately raised these issues with the INS but never 
    received a response.</font></font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
<font color="#000000" face="Verdana, sans-serif"><font size="2">In another 
    example, AL-Qatami said that a former ADC colleague had been called to go 
    pick up his Green Card from the INS. "But when he got there and identified 
    his birthplace as Nablus, a city in Palestine in the West Bank, the INS 
    refused to give it to him because they thought Nablus was Naples and that he 
    was from Italy," Al-Qatami said.</font></font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
<font color="#000000" face="Verdana, sans-serif"><font size="2">They cited 
    the community policing program, which is proven to be effective when managed 
    properly.</font></font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
<font color="#000000" face="Verdana, sans-serif"><font size="2">"It can be a 
    very effective law enforcement tool to build positive relationships for law 
    enforcement purposes and is applied very effectively in local communities," 
    Shora said.</font></font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
<font color="#000000" face="Verdana, sans-serif"><font size="2">"As it has 
    applied to the Arab community, community policing has completely backfired."</font></font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
<font color="#000000" face="Verdana, sans-serif"><font size="2">"We 
    understand that a lot of the people who do mean harm to our country speak 
    Arabic. But, how many members of the FBI were proficient in the Arabic 
    language before September 11, 2001? This is a police force of 11,000 to 
    13,000 people in the FBI yet only 10 or 11 in the FBI were proficient in 
    Arabic. How do you make community policing work with that deficiency? It 
    doesn't."</font></font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
<font color="#000000" face="Verdana, sans-serif"><font size="2">Al-Qatami 
    noted that the FBI had only one trained linguist who could perform a 
    polygraph test in Arabic.</font></font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
<font color="#000000" face="Verdana, sans-serif"><font size="2">"That man 
    eventually raised a discrimination complaint against the FBI because of the 
    way he was mistreated specifically because of who he was," Al-Qatami said.</font></font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
<font color="#000000" face="Verdana, sans-serif"><font size="2">Shora said 
    that the problems that surfaced immediately after Sept. 11 also have a 
    continuing, residual impact on the community today. People who did not come 
    forward during the special registration program, for example, because of 
    poor information or a lack of understanding of the program itself, are still 
    facing challenges to prove that they registered but did not.</font></font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
<font color="#000000" face="Verdana, sans-serif"><font size="2">"Many 
    residents come from countries where a country issues a travel document but 
    does not consider that person a citizen or national of that country, so 
    people fell through the cracks. Rather than recognize this so that the 
    program works effectively, nothing was done. Instead, the people who did not 
    register not because of their own fault but because of the government's 
    fault still face demands that they register or be deported," Shora said.</font></font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
<font color="#000000" face="Verdana, sans-serif"><font size="2">The problem 
    is most acute for Palestinian Arabs, in part because of the ongoing 
    political issues involving the Palestine-Israel conflict and law makers and 
    elected officials who are using post-Sept. 11 concerns to advance their own 
    political agendas.</font></font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
<font color="#000000" face="Verdana, sans-serif"><font size="2">Shora said 
    that while it is important for Arab and Muslim Americans to support the 
    programs and meet the guidelines established to protect this country, the 
    government officials also need to do a better job to "know what they are 
    talking about."</font></font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
<font color="#000000" face="Verdana, sans-serif"><font size="2">Shora said 
    the problem is that while people are trying to do what they are being asked 
    to do, its the agencies who are dropping the ball. "But the applicants and 
    the immigrants and the Green Card holders and those with Visas ARE the ones 
    who are suffering and they have nothing to do with the challenges of the War 
    on Terrorism. It confuses the whole system. The war against terrorism should 
    not be converted into a war against immigrants. Our country is and always 
    has been a nation of immigrants."</font></font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
<font color="#000000" face="Verdana, sans-serif"><font size="2">Al-Qatami 
    acknowledged that the media plays a significant role in confusing the 
    process and promoting inaccurate information that, in the end, undermines 
    the overall goals of the country.</font></font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
<font color="#000000" face="Verdana, sans-serif"><font size="2">"Worse, it 
    has a tremendously negative impact on the image of what America is doing 
    among the people of the Middle East themselves. They see and hear about 
    these problems day-to-day. But instead of addressing the problems, they 
    respond with public relations," Al-Qatami said.</font></font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
<font color="#000000" face="Verdana, sans-serif"><font size="2">"The Arab 
    American community is not a new community. We have had people immigrate to 
    this country from the mid-19th Century. But after September 11, it was 
    almost as if Americans and government agencies and public officials knew 
    nothing about us at all. We were immediately alienated and treated like 
    suspects rather than as an integral part of the United States because of 
    these policies and because of the lack of basic information. it was an 
    extended knee-jerk reaction. If we just saw this happen for a short period 
    of time, after September 11, I might say it is natural and an exception. But 
    three years later, it is still happening," Shora said.</font></font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
<font color="#000000" face="Verdana, sans-serif"><font size="2">Al-Qatami 
    said that many in the Arab World and Arab community see and hear about these 
    problems. But instead of correcting the problems by offering training to 
    their staff, the United States has launched a PR Campaign to make America 
    look better.</font></font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
<font color="#000000" face="Verdana, sans-serif"><font size="2">"I think 
    public relations is important but if they wanted to improve the image of the 
    United States in the Arab World, for example, and to counter the negative 
    images or feelings, they should correct the problems they have with their 
    policies and programs and show that we, as Americans, understand the Arab World and 
    the Muslim World," Al-Qatami said.</font></font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
<font color="#000000" face="Verdana, sans-serif"><font size="2">"They are 
    not going to do that with the millions being spent on Radio Sawwa, al-Hurra 
    TV or Hi Magazine," Al-Qatami said referring to three public relations 
    initiatives launched in the Middle East by the U.S. Government.</font></font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
<font color="#000000" face="Verdana, sans-serif"><font size="2">"When they 
    see real stories about how Arabs and Muslims being mistreated, they are left 
    with a negative image that not even the best public relations campaign can 
    correct. Sometimes, the best campaign is to just correct the problems."</font></font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
<font color="#000000" face="Verdana, sans-serif"><font size="2">Shora said 
    there have been some positive changes. He cited efforts by the Department of 
    Homeland Security over the past six months to adjust programs and clarify 
    information. "They saw the negative impact that these programs were having 
    and they are adjusting and changing and that is important to note. Yet, many 
    of the problems still continue and no one is changing them or improving 
    them. That's discouraging."</font></font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
<font color="#000000" face="Verdana, sans-serif"><font size="2">The 
    political exploitation of America's tragedy by individuals with other 
    agendas is just as troubling, they said.</font></font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
<font face="Verdana, sans-serif" size="2"><font color="#000000">Wisconsin 
    Congressman F. James Sensenbrenner has introduced legislation that requires 
    that drivers licenses not be renewed unless an immigrant can show proof of 
    LAWFUL immigration status.</font></font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
<font color="#000000" face="Verdana, sans-serif"><font size="2">"What it 
    does wrongly is puts an undue burden on every state to enforce federal 
    immigration law. If you can't show proof of your immigration status, you 
    can't get a driver's license. They want a driver's license to expire when an 
    immigration status expires. It has a direct And negative impact on our 
    community and instead of improving security it makes it worse," Shora said.</font></font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
<font color="#000000" face="Verdana, sans-serif"><font size="2">More 
    troubling, he said, is that Sensenbrenner has added a provision that is 
    politically motivated and has nothing to do with addressing American 
    security issues.</font></font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.19in; margin-bottom: 0.19in">
<font color="#000000" face="Verdana, sans-serif"><font size="2">"The bill 
    includes brief language that essentially says that if you are a member, 
    spokesman or representative for the Palestine Liberation Organization, you 
    are by default considered to be engaging in terrorism and therefore cannot 
    enter the United States. These provisions distort the whole issue of 
    security and considers anyone involved with the Palestinian issue to be a 
    terrorist. The bill refers to the State Department to identify which groups 
    are terrorist organizations, but the PLO is not on the State Department's 
    list. Essentially, Sensenbrenner is trying to dictate the foreign policy of 
    the United States. If this bill is adopted, it means that anyone who is with 
    the PLO can't enter the United States. That includes Mahmoud Abbas who was 
    just elected the new president of Palestine. He is the chairman of the PLO. 
    Unfortunately, This kind of problem is too common in our congress."</font></font></p>

<font color="#000000" face="Verdana, sans-serif"><font size="2">Shora and 
    Al-Qatami both agree that in addition to supporting ADC, and becoming 
    members, Arab and Muslim Americans can also help by becoming actively 
    engaged in their own communities where they live, such as being involved in 
    the local school board, the PTA, or participating in meetings with their 
    local government and elected officials, senator, legislator.</font></font></p>

      there to provide advice and referrals. ADC has a cadre of full time staff 
      attorneys ready to help defend the interests of the community, one person 
      at a time. Our staff attorneys have helped hundreds of people defend 
      themselves against a wide variety of abuses, and been instrumental in many 
      important legal victories in the fight for civil rights and against 
      discrimination. ADC's Education Department works with schools, teachers 
      and Arab-American parents across the country to combat discrimination and 
      tensions in school and ensure that the curriculum does not perpetuate 
      stereotypes or misinformation about the Arab world or Islam. ADC also 
      serves as a vital clearing house of accurate information on Arab culture 
      and history for educators and school systems. </li>
