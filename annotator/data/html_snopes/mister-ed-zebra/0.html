  This episode, much like the "real first episode" includes
only Rocky Lane (voice of Mister Ed) as the regular cast members. All others
are played by different actors/actresses. There is no Addison charracter
in the pilot, either. The theme is different, and instead of the character
of Wilbur Post, there is Wilbur Pope. The story line is the same as "The
First Meeting".
