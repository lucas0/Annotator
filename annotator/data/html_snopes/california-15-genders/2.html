<div class="head2">IT’S NOT THE STORK!</div>
<div class="head4">A Book About Girls, Boys, Babies, Bodies, Families, and Friends</div>
<p>Candlewick Press, August 2006</p>
<p>Illustrated by Michael Emberley</p>
<p>Our young children are curious about almost everything. They are especially curious about their bodies, about where they came from and how they were made. Many, but not all, ask us endless questions about these topics. They ask us why their bodies are the same and different from other peoples’ bodies, what makes a girl a girl and a boy a boy, what the names are of all the different parts of their bodies, where babies come from, how babies are made, what a family is — and so many other questions about themselves and their bodies. Many of their questions are easy to answer. Others are more difficult to answer. Michael Emberley and I created this book to answer young children’s many questions and concerns about these issues. We talked with parents, teachers, librarians, nurses, doctors, social workers, psychologists, scientists and clergy to make sure that all of the material in this book is comfortable, reassuring, age-appropriate and scientifically accurate.</p>
<p>This book, written especially for four, five, and six year olds, is the book to reach for when the questions begin — young children’s questions about where babies come from and what makes a girl and girl and a boy a boy. With the publication of this book, children of all ages and their families have a library of books — It’s Perfectly Normal for children age 10 and up; It’s So Amazing! for children age 7 and up and now, It’s Not the Stork! for children age 4 and up.

Here they successfully tackle the big  questions about body parts (in successive chapters called “What Boys  Have” and “What Girls Have”), where babies come from, and other related  issues for even younger kids. The ever-curious cartoon bird and his more  reticent bee friend, first introduced in It’s So Amazing!, set a  welcoming tone right from the beginning, when, in a double-page  comic-strip spread, they see a baby hippo at the zoo and wonder about  its origins. Using basic yet thorough explanations, the text then  proceeds to inform the duo that babies don’t grow in gardens or get  ordered over the Internet. Emberley’s relaxed cartoon depictions of  children and grownups with a realistic array of body types work  seamlessly with the text to illustrate everything from anatomy to fetal  development to different configurations of families. One useful and  particularly humorous illustration titled “Pregnant Woman at the Movies”  exemplifies the book’s attention to detail. A mixed-race family — white  mom, black dad, son, and baby in utero — sit in their seats at the  theater while labels pointing to the mother’s middle distinguish between  the stomach and the uterus, clearly showing children that “the fetus  doesn’t grow where the popcorn goes!”

<p class="expand"> <img src="http://robieharris.com/img/star.gif"/> “Harris opens by introducing two cartoon characters — a green-feathered  bird clad in a purple <span class="read-more">… <a href="#">[read more]</a></span><span class="details" style="display: none;">shirt and blue high-top sneakers and his  spike-haired friend, a bee. They wonder, “So where DO babies come from?”  their conversational commentary, given in word balloons, is a  lighthearted supplement to a more focused narrative. Told in the second  person, the text is straightforward, informative, and personable. Facts  are presented step-by-step, starting from the similarities and  differences between boys’ and girls’ bodies, moving to a baby’s  conception, growth in the womb, and birth, ending with an exploration of  different configurations of families as well as a section on “okay”  versus “not okay” touches. The book is logically organized into 23  double-page sections. Friendly and relaxed cartoons, either interspersed  with the text or appearing in comic strip form, are integral to the  title’s success in imparting the material. The labeled drawings show  both the outside and inside parts of the body. As the bee and bird say  to one another, “Knowing the names of ALL the parts of your body is —  PERFECTLY NORMAL!” Overall, this book will be accessible to its intended  audience, comforting in its clarity and directness, and useful to a  wide range of readers.”

<p class="expand">“What a joyous world Robie Harris and Michael Emberley have created for learning about everyone. <span class="read-more">… <a href="#">[read more]</a></span><span class="details" style="display: none;">First, they enchanted us with <em>It’s Perfectly Normal</em>, a welcome guide for young adolescents about what’s happening to their bodies, and <em>It’s So Amazing!</em>, an illustrated educational resource, for those wonderfully curious people aged seven to 12 years old. Now they give us <em>It’s NOT the Stork</em>, which answers “the perfectly normal” questions of children ages four to seven in a celebration of life from birth to old age.<br/>It’s difficult to measure the importance of the vision of open  communication about sexuality that Harris and Emberley have achieved.  It’s their winning combination that charms: Harris’ meticulous research  and understanding of children’s development and Emberley’s delightful  illustrations that include people of all varieties. As a grandmother, I  especially appreciated the grandma in shorts with a golf club, rather  than in a rocking chair. Yes, absolutely, this book is a treasure trove  for parents. For many, it will be a great relief — a joyful and accurate  way to open communication with their children. Somehow Harris gets  things just right: first a trip to the zoo filled with questions. Next a  section, “So-ooo Many Questions!” encouraging children to ask away.  Then wonderful pages showing all the things both boys and girls can do:  “Boys can climb trees and do karate!” “So do girls!” “Girls cry when  they see scary monsters!” “So do boys!” Next come the differences —  beginning, of course, with how they use the toilet. Drawings of the  backs of a naked boy and girl name all those body parts that are the  same; drawings of the fronts show the differences, including a vulva  that identifies a clitoris and explains: “girls and women have three  openings between their legs … ” Harris’ genius is her ability to make  the complex simple, to answer incipient questions with a few key facts  and to resolve the mysteries, e.g., changes that happen at puberty.  Meanwhile, Emberley’s illustrations show delightfully average and not  model type girls and women, boys and men at six stages of life. On they  go, explaining sperm and eggs, a “special kind of loving called ‘making  love,’ ‘having sex,’ or ‘sex’ … when the woman and man get so close to  each other that the man’s penis goes inside the woman’s vagina.’” Oh! I  predict some parents may skip a few words here and fast-forward to the  fascinating picture of the pregnant woman in the movies which shows the  popcorn in her stomach and the fetus in her uterus! Or, to the actual  size pictures of the embryo and the fetus up to nine months. Next comes  the joy of the birthday, a celebration of different kinds of families, a  savvy description of “Okay Touches, Not Okay Touches,” and finally an  accolade to “Growing Up.” The feisty conversations of the curious bird  and reluctant bee that delighted adults, as well as children in the two  earlier books, continue their playful/serious commentary throughout It’s  NOT the Stork! What a brilliant way to validate questioning, not  knowing, and searching for information.<br/>Bird: “So-ooo, a baby, comes from a STORK???”<br/>Bee: “I don’t THINK so!!!”<br/>Bee: “Knowing the names of ALL the parts of your body is —”<br/>Bird: “PERFECTLY NORMAL!”<br/>The Harris/Emberley books provide an important vision of a  comprehensive sexuality education. Even if you have no children or  grandchildren, buy one for yourself�enjoy it, laugh with it and pass it  on to nieces, nephews, friends … Every child deserves an opportunity  to wander through these pages, doubtless to return again and again, so  very lucky to find clear answers to fundamental questions that many  puzzle about for years.”

<p class="expand">“A breathtaking amount of research went into the creation of  this child’s first book about sex. <span class="read-more">… <a href="#">[read more]</a></span><span class="details" style="display: none;">Several years in the making, it is a  masterpiece of combining an age-appropriate amount of information in a  way that is inviting, upbeat and clear. This book has no agenda other  than to present accurate information about our bodies and, ultimately,  how babies are made.<br/>Beginning with acknowledging that there are many ways in which  girls and boys are the same, it goes on to talk about and illustrate  the ways in which they are physically different—both externally and  internally. Smoothly and in a way children can understand, the topic  segues into how those differences make it possible for eggs and sperm to  be produced, why they exist, and how a baby begins and is ultimately  born. The book touches on other issues any child can encounter and any  curious child can be expected to wonder about—C-sections, multiple  births, circumcision, adoption, foster parents, stepparents, “okay  touches” and “NOT okay touches”—and does so with graceful and simple  aplomb.<br/>It’s NOT the Stork! offers a solid foundation upon which our  children can feel knowledgeable and comfortable about their bodies.  Approved by science, health and child-development experts, it is a  classic in the making. Robie Harris and Michael Emberley have created  the perfect book for curious children (and what children aren’t curious  about their bodies, where babies come from, etc.?) and their parents. As  far as we’re concerned, it belongs in every home!”

<p class="expand">“Where do babies come from? This perfectly normal question  makes some parents squirm. But help is <span class="read-more">… <a href="#">[read more]</a></span><span class="details" style="display: none;">on the way with an honest answer  in the amazingly clear and comprehensive “It’s Not the Stork” written by  Robie H. Harris and illustrated by Michael Emberley.<br/>Some young kids will pour over every tidbit, cover to cover.  After all, this subject has sex appeal. Other kids will cruise around  the short chapters checking out the hilariously instructive cartoons and  assiduously labeled diagrams. (Bodies are viewed front and back.)<br/>For some kids, the book offers a venue for shared experience  with parents or peers. And, certainly, adults will gratefully draw on  the book’s frank language and friendly tone when talking things over  with their kids in the car or at the zoo.<br/>The creators of the award-winning “It’s Perfectly Normal”  (1994) and “It’s So Amazing” (1999), aimed at teens and ‘tweens  respectively, this time offer an introductory course on the birds and  the bees for a younger audience, with the now familiar Bird-and-Bee  exchanging disarming banter along the way. On learning about the uterus,  Bird concludes, “So the fetus doesn’t grow where the popcorn goes!”  Replies Bee, “You got it!”<br/>This must-have family resource addresses all kinds of such  funny misconceptions, supplying instead the real facts of life.  Carefully vetted by science, health and child development experts,  everything is correct as correct can be—information about gender  differences, reproduction, different kinds of families and different  kinds of friends. And it is surprisingly inclusive, gracefully touching  on such topics as in-vitro fertilization, same-sex parents and adoption.<br/>Living in an age when preschoolers are likely to encounter ads  for Viagra on radio and TV, “It’s Not the Stork” is especially welcome.  When it comes to sex, kids need information that is reassuring,  accurate, up-to-date and age-appropriate. And that surely means finding  out about function before having to find out about dysfunction.”

<p class="expand">“If it’s not the stork, where do babies come from? Does mommy  swallow a watermelon seed? Does <span class="read-more">… <a href="#">[read more]</a></span><span class="details" style="display: none;">daddy buy a bag of seeds, plant then in  the garden and then mommy picks the baby she wants off the resulting  vine? Does daddy order one on-line? Or does a stork drop a baby down a  chimney to be caught by the expectant parents? No, no, no and gently no,  are the answers, in this fine introduction to the birds and bees, one  well-laced with humorous illustrations and diagrams that convey  information as well as maintain the cheerful, even exuberant, “it’s  perfectly natural” tone of this book.<br/>It’s a book that pulls no punches about body parts and  functions, and one of its virtues is that it names things for what they  are and doesn’t shrink from calling a poo a poo; the vernacular is an  effective means of communication for this intended audience. Some of the  areas of sexuality and family life explored are insemination,  pregnancy—from “pinpoint to watermelon”—the birth process, a variety of  different models of family life, and touching that’s okay and touching  that’s not.”

<div class="dashed">
<p class="expand">“What’s the “right” age at which to introduce information on  human reproduction? Harris agrees <span class="read-more">… <a href="#">[read more]</a></span><span class="details" style="display: none;">that’s for individual families to  decide, and to give an assist to parents who feel “the younger, the  better,” she has abridged her presentation from It’s So Amazing for an  even younger audience. Adults familiar with Amazing will note that the  format remains pretty much the same, right down to the curious cartoon  bird and reticent bee that trade quips on their newly acquired  knowledge; language, however, is slightly simplified and tidbits of  information are deleted (topics such as masturbation, homosexuality, and  types of twins are introduced, but they receive less detailed  treatment) to shorten the text by some twenty pages. Emberley’s cartoon  cast, a celebration of demographic diversity, do double duty as helpful  diagrams of body parts and fetal development, and as examples of loving  families in action. The developmental bridge between this title and  Amazing is considerably shorter than the span between Amazing and  Perfectly Normal, and although public libraries will certainly want to  offer all three works, families looking for that one good book for their  preschoolers might just as well trade up a level to Amazing for more  complete information, and customize their readalouds to suit their own  children’s needs.”

Robie Harris is unique  in her ability to provide straightforward, reassuring answers to the  questions children have about their bodies, sexuality and growing up, in  straightforward, reassuring manner. In a respectful voice and with  age-appropriate language, “It’s NOT the Stork!” helps answer those  endless questions preschool, kindergarten and early elementary school  children wonder about and often ask, such as, “Where do babies come  from?” and “What makes a girl a girl?”<br/>Cartoon drawings illustrate the text and include two  characters, (curious) Bird and (embarrassed) Bee, who offer humorous and  clarifying asides.

<em>It’s NOT the Stork!</em> helps parents explain<br/>“One college memory that still cracks me up was the <span class="read-more">… <a href="#">[read more]</a></span><span class="details" style="display: none;">night a  roommate innocently revealed incomplete knowledge about her own body and  reproduction. And she was the only one of us who had a steady  boyfriend. She wouldn’t have embarrassed herself if she had read Robie  Harris’ new picture book “It’s NOT the Stork!”. Harris does an enormous  favor for any parent who becomes tongue tied when trying to explain  biology and babies. The subtitle just about says it all: “A Book About  Girls, Boys, Babies, Bodies, Families, and Friends.” “It’s NOT the  Stork!” is pure sterling. Harris, a former teacher, burst into the  picture-book world in 1994 with “It’s Perfectly Normal,” a fun,  fact-filled presentation for ages 10 to 13 about growing up and puberty.  Five years later, she wrote “It’s So Amazing,” a fact-based narrative  about the complicated science of eggs, sperm, babies and bodies for ages  7 to 10. Both have won national awards, and both have weathered  challenges from communities unhappy about a frank, graphic approach to  knowledge about sex. Harris’ new book is perfect for the pre-schooler  who’s asking where he or she came from and about the differences between  a boy and a girl. Even parents comfortable talking about one’s  “privates” and human biology will appreciate Harris’ relaxed, humorous  approach and her silly sidekicks, Bird and Bee. Without blinking, Harris  covers her subject from head to toe. She uses authentic names to point  out arms, legs, elbows and privates. The parts are shown on boys and  girls depicted in colorful, perky drawings by Michael Emberley. His  illustrations of how the sperm and eggs get together includes an  algebraic equation, a smiling couple under the covers and a pink sea of  tadpolelike sperm swimming to the egg. Beyond body parts, gestation,  birth and bellybuttons, Harris describes all kinds of “awesome”  families, such as those with one mom or dad, two moms or dads, adoptive  parents, foster parents and grandparents. In the concluding chapter  “Okay Touches, Not Okay Touches,” she empowers children to say “no.” No  family with young children (or naïve young adults?) should miss this  one.”
