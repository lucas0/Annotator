      JAMES A. KISNER<br/>( PoppyK1 ) 
     </th>

Author of "Roses for Rose" and hundreds of poetic stories that have been read on the Internet
by thousands of readers throughout the world. His "poetic stories" appear on hundreds of websites
and have been published in many well known publications such as Heartwarmers of Love, Stories of
the Heart and The "Chicken Soup for the Soul" collections.
<br/><br/>
He writes about the realities of
life in poetic form. Many of the stories are his own personal experiences while others are about
life itself and the trials and tribulations we all face and endure. 
<br/><br/>
His stories bring hope to the
troubled heart and true understanding of situations that we encounter. Having lost his wife at an
early age to cancer, many of his poetic stories are about the loss of a loved one and dealing with
loneliness, but most are about hope and comfort. 
<br/><br/>
His "poetic stories" will touch your heart in some
way. You will identify with many of the stories as if they were written about you. You will find
yourself drawn into the stories as if the words were being written about a situation in your life.
You will find that somewhere along the way, as you read the stories, you will experience tears,
but they will be tender tears. Not tears of sorrow or heartache but tears of emotion. Emotions that 
have been touched because you understand that real life is about emotions and we are
emotional beings. It has been said "If you finish one of his books without shedding a tear,
check your pulse for a heartbeat."
