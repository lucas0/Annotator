<font size="4">Who was he – Dr. Jekyll or Mr. Hyde? For sure, he was 
		both! He was fun loving, friendly, and kind but he was also deceitful, 
		spiteful, and cruel. He was gentle, polite, and unassuming but he was 
		also violent, ruthless, and dangerous. He would change from “Mr. Nice 
		Guy” to “Mr. Villain” in a flash and there was no telling when the 
		transition would take place.</font></span></p>

<span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS; font-weight: 700">
<font size="4"> McCoy always carried a roll of money with him and he was 
		likely to show up any place at any time. He liked good times, jokes, and 
		women. They liked him too. Playwright Maurice Maeterlinck wrote that he 
		was the “Handsomest human on earth”. He married eight times, three times 
		to the same woman (see McCallum, 1975, p 192).</font></span></p></td></tr></tbody></table>

		Every so often a boxer comes along who seems to 
		anticipate his opponents’ every move – Nonpareil Jack Dempsey, Jim 
		Corbett, Jack Johnson, Gene Tunney, and Muhammad Ali were such men. They

		himself. The New York World newspaper once described his movements as 
		“quiet and cat-like” and wrote that “He does not look the prizefighter, 
		nor is he built like one.”</font></span></p>

		wily corkscrew artist, a cagey,  clever battler." Odd (1983, pp 83 84)

		His first fight took place in 1891 and his last in 1916. Some sources

		He gave Gus Ruhlin, top heavyweight contender, a terrible drubbing.</font></span></p>

<font size="4">Philadelphia Jack O’Brien said McCoy was “vicious, fast, 
		and almost impossible to beat” (see McCallum, 1975, p 190). When his 
		cruel streak surfaced (which was often), he would butcher his opponents 
		excessively with his ripping, slicing type of punches. In many a fight, 
		when he had his man staggering around and nearly out on his feet, 
		instead of finishing him off, the Kid would suddenly change tactics and 
		dance around his man cutting him up with his “corkscrew” punches. </font>

		According to McCallum (1975, p 191) “The Kid had 
		marvelous speed and elusiveness, besides his tricks and the cruel, 
		cutting power of his punches.” Cantwell (1971, p 42) reported that after 
		fighting McCoy, Jack Wilkes’ face “resembled a raw beefsteak.”  He added 
		(p 46), against Tommy West, McCoy cut loose and had West bleeding and 
		groggy as he floored him six times.<br/>

<p class="MsoBodyText">
<span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS; font-weight: 700">
<font size="4">McCoy began his career with a series of victories. His 
		first loss occurred when he fought the scrappy Billy Steffers. Young and 
		cocky, the Kid thought so little of Steffers that he walked to the 
		center of the ring at the opening bell and stuck out his chin at his 
		opponent - big mistake. Billy caught McCoy on the point of the chin and 
		ended it right then.<br/>
 </font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
<span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS; font-weight: 700">
<font size="4">McCoy met Steffers again, nearly four months later. This

		and stiff punches on the way to a 10-0 shutout win.<br/>

		One of McCoy’s best-known fights was his victory against 
		the terrific light-heavyweight, Joe Choynski. It was a red-hot contest 
		with plenty of knockdowns between two crafty, sharp-hitting fighters. 
		McCoy knocked Choynski down 16 times and was floored 12 times himself. 
		Following this bout, the Kid picked up the moniker the “Real McCoy.”<br/>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
<span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS; font-weight: 700">
<font size="4">An interesting story surrounds McCoy’s fight with Tom 
		Sharkey. In the old days, when no films of an opponent were available 
		for study, fighters often hired men who had sparred with or fought 
		against their upcoming foe. McCoy and his entourage kidnapped big Bob 
		Armstrong, who was a frequent sparring partner of “Sailor Tom”, and took 
		him prisoner to McCoy’s camp to find out about Sharkey’s strengths and 
		weaknesses. Armstrong was so angered by this act that he fed McCoy 
		incorrect information. The result was that McCoy lost his bout against 
		Sharkey.<br/>
 </font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
<span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS; font-weight: 700">
<font size="4">After the Kid retired from boxing in 1916, he served in 
		the U.S. Army during World War I. Following that, he went to Hollywood 
		and acted in a few movies. In 1924, he was convicted of murdering 
		Theresa Mors, a divorcee who was living with him. He was paroled in 1932 
		and, afterwards, worked for Ford Motor Company. McCoy committed suicide 
		in Detroit on April 18, 1940.<br/>

		McCallum writes (1975, p 190) “It’s possible that for his weight, which 
		ranged from 145 pounds to 170, McCoy was the finest fighter in the 
		world, when he was at his best.”<br/>
 </font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
<span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS; font-weight: 700">
<font size="4">Johnston (1949) wrote “McCoy was one of the most skillful

 </font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
<span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS; font-weight: 700">
<font size="4">McCoy was elected to the Ring Boxing Hall of Fame in 1957

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify">
<span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS; font-weight: 700">
<font size="4"><br/>
		In the opinion of this writer, McCoy was the among the greatest fighters 
		of all time in three divisions – the #3 Welterweight, the #7 
		Middleweight, the #7 Light-Heavyweight. He was also one of the all-time 
		best “Pound-for-Pound” boxers who ever entered the ring.</font></span></p>
