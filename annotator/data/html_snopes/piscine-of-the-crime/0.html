<h3 align="CENTER"></h3>
<p align="LEFT"><b><font color="#0000FF" size="+3">Q:</font></b><br/>
        I have read the archives and understand that maintaining a small children's 
        pool will require water changes. What I couldn't find an answer to is: 
        What is the appropriate quantity of chemical to put in the pool? I have 
        a 300 gallon children's pool in which I would like to keep the water for 
        at least 3 weeks. I have a cleaning system and cover. The manufacturer 
        recommends household bleach, but I can't seem to get the quantity correct. 
        Local pool supply merchants have been most unhelpful, and local stores 
        sell supplies for pools in 10,000 gallons per tablet dosages.... Do I 
        just need to guess?<br/>
<br/>
        K.H. - Houston, TX</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b><font color="#FF0000" size="+3">A:</font></b><br/>
        If you want a simple quantity to add, I can't help you. You have to add 
        enough chlorine to maintain a level of 1-3 PPM. Unfortunately, in a small 
        kiddy pool that is not as easy as it seems. Bathers deplete chlorine, 
        urine really depletes chlorine big time, waste products and debris deplete 
        chlorine, sunlight depletes chlorine, etc.<br/>
<br/>
        You have to do a little trial and error. A small floater with a chlorine 
        tablet might be a good idea. The product is slow dissolving and you could 
        remove the floater, if the level rises too high. <br/>
<br/>
        There is not substitute for testing, if you want to optimize the water 
        -- even in a kiddy pool. <br/>
<br/>
        Good luck.<br/>
<br/>
        Sincerely,<br/>

<h3 align="CENTER">Solar Cover's Affect On Water Chemistry (11/4/98)</h3>
<p align="LEFT"><b><font color="#0000FF" size="+3">Q:</font></b><br/>How does
a pool cover (meant to trap infrared heat) affect the chemistry of the pool
water?  I've asked this question to a number of  different "experts"
and received rather conflicting answers.  Here are some examples:<br/><br/>- The
pool cover heats the water, which causes the chlorine to bubble out of the water
faster.<br/><br/>- The pool cover prevents atmospheric oxygen from "reacting"
with the pool water, thus making the pool acidic regardless of whether or not
the pool has chemicals in it.<br/><br/>- The pool cover prevents the pool water 
from evaporating, which keeps the chemicals in the water longer.  The pool
should remain covered whenever you are not using it.<br/><br/>What is the
CORRECT answer to the question?<br/><br/>S.N. - San Jose, CA 
</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b><font color="#FF0000" size="+3">A:</font></b><br/>I'm not
sure that I agree with all of the answers.<br/><br/>1.  The cover does cause the
water temperature to rise.  The reason that the chlorine levels can drop more
quickly is that the higher temperature makes the chlorine more reactive with
algae and organic wastes.<br/><br/>2.  The cover can reduce the absorption of
atmospheric gases.  Carbon dioxide absorption will cause a slight lowering of
the pH.  I don't believe that oxygen will affect the pH to any significant
extent.  Because the water temperature is higher, pools on 3" trichlor
tablets will be dissolving them at a greater rate and this in turn will help
lower the pH.<br/><br/>3.  Evaporating water does not remove the chemicals from
the water -- they remain behind.<br/><br/>I hope that I have been helpful.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Alan</p>

<h3 align="CENTER">Irritated Eyes (7/15/98)</h3>
<p align="LEFT"><b><font color="#0000FF" size="+3">Q:</font></b><br/>I hear
people when they come out of a pool say their eyes are bothering them because
there is too much chlorine in the pool.  I think their eyes are bothering them
because the PH level is off, or not enough chlorine, or maybe their are other
chemicals in the water.  What is the truth? Can over-chlorinating be a problem
where you shouldn't swim?<br/><br/>T.D. - Raynham, MA</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b><font color="#FF0000" size="+3">A:</font></b><br/>High or
low pH reading could lead to irritation.  The pH of the eye is approx. 7.6.<br/><br/>Too
high a chlorine level can preclude swimming.  That's why there are recommended
ranges.<br/><br/>The irritation you are referring to is most likely caused by
the presence of high levels of combined chlorine (chloramines).  Chloramines are
irritating, odorous, ineffective forms of combined chlorine.  The chlorine odor
associated with pool water is most likely chloramine and is the reason that pool
water is periodically shocked.<br/><br/>I hope that I have been helpful.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Alan</p>

<h3 align="CENTER">The Color Of A Swimming Pool (7/9/98)</h3>
<p align="LEFT"><b><font color="#0000FF" size="+3">Q:</font></b><br/>I have a
somewhat unusual question for you, a question about the color of pool water. Are
pools the color they usually are (i.e. blue or aqua) because the chlorine is
that color, or are they blue/aqua because their walls and bottoms  are painted
this color? For example, would it be possible to have, say, a pink or purple
pool, or would the chlorine give the water a blueish tint, affecting the look of
the pool?</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b><font color="#FF0000" size="+3">A:</font></b><br/>The
color of a swimming pool is largely the result of the color of the walls and
bottom.<br/><br/>Most pools are in the aqua-blue range, because that reinforces
the natural faint blue color of pure water.  The addition of chemicals can
slightly alter the color.  Pools are built with all types of colored surfaces,
from white to black.<br/><br/>While it is possible to add colorants to the
water, it is not necessarily effective or permanent.  <br/><br/>A pink or purple
wall would certainly impart a pink-purple caste to the water.<br/><br/>I hope
that I have been of assistance.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Alan</p>

<h3 align="CENTER">Frogs In The Pool (6/23/98)</h3>
<p align="LEFT"><b><font color="#0000FF" size="+3">Q:</font></b><br/>I have
been out of my house since Nov. Now I have frogs living in my pool (hundreds of
em) and it is dark green. I dropped the water level down about 1 foot  where the
jets are showing above the water line. What do you recommend next for me to do?
My pool is 15000 gal. inground deep end is 8 ft. low end is 3 ft. It has a 4
year old surface on it.<br/><br/>J.B. - Cocoa, FL</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b><font color="#FF0000" size="+3">A:</font></b><br/>Sounds
like you are allowed your pool to become a pond and a green one at that.<br/><br/>In
Florida it is not uncommon to have frogs, snakes and other living creatures in
there from time to time.  It's one of the penalties of not having a screened in
pool.  I scoop them out with the net and give them the heave ho.<br/><br/>My
wife happens to collects frogs - not the living types - so let's not hurt
them!!!!<br/><br/>Get the water level to the proper height and start filtering
continuously. Add shock at the rate of 1 pound/gallon per 5,000 gallons of
water.  Adjust pH, T/A, etc.  Retest FREE CHLORINE level every few hours and
keep adding shock until you get FREE CHLORINE level of at least 3 PPM that
overnight. Thereafter maintain normally.   Your filter may be prone to short
cycles because of all the debris.  If pressure rises too high, perform
appropriate maintenance.  To help clear up the water quicker, try adding
<a href="/web/20010302115908/http://www.aqua-clear.com/products/swimfree/swf1.htm"><font color="#0000FF">Swim-Free

are less likely to have a frog problem if the pool does not resemble a pond.<br/><br/>Good
luck.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Alan</p>

<h3 align="CENTER">Draining A Pool (6/8/98)</h3>
<p align="LEFT"><b><font color="#0000FF" size="+3">Q:</font></b><br/>We
bought our new home Aug. 97 and have had the water tested in by a pool store and
by our pool man. Both state that the pool water must be completely drained about
every five years.  Since we know nothing about pools and we aren't sure whether
or not this is correct and I have been unable to find anything on the net
regarding this question, can you please advise.<br/><br/>K.R. - Agoura, CA</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b><font color="#FF0000" size="+3">A:</font></b><br/>There is
no set answer to the question as to how long a pool can go without being
emptied.  It depends on the nature of the source water, types and quantities of
chemicals used, total dissolved solids, pool construction, filter type, part of
the country, etc.  If the pool is winterized that effects the water quality over
the long term.<br/><br/>I'm guessing that you have a gunite pool.  Masonry pools
are periodically emptied for acid washing.  How often depends on many factors.<br/><br/>If
the pool looks good and there are no water chemistry problems, I'm inclined to
think that you should take it one year at a time.  Ask some neighbors about
their experiences.<br/><br/>Enjoy the season.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Alan</p>

<h3 align="CENTER">Mosquitoes Around The Pool (5/6/98)</h3>
<p align="LEFT"><b><font color="#0000FF" size="+3">Q:</font></b><br/>We had
an inground pool installed in our backyard at the end of last summer.  We live
deep in the woods and never had a problem with mosquitoes until this spring. 
Since we opened the pool we have been plagued with mosquitoes using the solar
cover as a breeding ground.    Is there a product that we can put in the pool
water, that will eliminate the mosquito problem, both now and throughout the
summer months?  Even when we are using the solar cover?<br/><br/>K.S. -
Georgetown, DE</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b><font color="#FF0000" size="+3">A:</font></b><br/>Mosquitoes
will do what mosquitoes do.<br/><br/>Standing water is the problem.  I wouldn't
recommend using an insecticide in the pool.<br/><br/>There is something you can
try in dealing with the mosquitoes on the pool surface.  They are able to walk
on the surface because of the surface tension of the water.  If you add
<a href="/web/20010302115908/http://www.aqua-clear.com/products/sun/sun3.htm"><font color="#0000FF">SUN Algae Preventor</font></a>
as an algaecide, you will lower the surface tension and, hopefully, they will
slip under and drown.<br/><br/>I hope the advice works.  Good luck.<br/><br/>Sincerely,

<p align="LEFT"><b><font color="#FF0000" size="+3">A:</font></b><br/>There is
no chemical that can function as an indicator for urine in a pool.<br/><br/>If a
child has done it in the pool, there will be an immediate rise in the combined
chlorine level and the pungent odor of chloramines.  This will require a large
amount of shock to destroy the combined chlorine and re-establish a free
chlorine level.<br/><br/>I hope that I have been of assistance.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/>Alan</p>

the best and easiest way to clean out the deposits which accumulate in the

very well.  Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.<br/><br/>C.L
- Effingham, IL</p>
<p align="LEFT"><b><font color="#FF0000" size="+3">A:</font></b><br/> It
doesn't surprise me that dilute muriatic acid didn't work.  Chlorine tablets
form a weakly acidic solution in the chlorinator and the acid solution that you
tried was too similar.<br/><br/>It is possible that the deposits are caused by
trace minerals present in the local water or by action of the chlorine over the
long term.<br/><br/>Not knowing the specific details and rather than speculate,
why not ask the pool dealer?  If it is widespread in your area your local dealer
will have knowledge of it.<br/><br/>As a precaution you should never clean the
chlorinator with anything that will contact the chlorine.  Remove all
chlorine!!!  Rinse all traces of chlorine and cleaner.<br/><br/>I hope that I
