<p><font face="arial, arial, helvetica"><b><font color="#0000FF">America, 
              Mark Twain once said</font></b>, is a nation without a distinct 
              criminal class "with the possible exception of Congress."<br/>
</font></p>
<p>If anything, the Congress of today is even worse than it was in 
              Twain's time more than a century ago.<br/>
</p>
<p>The 535 men and women who make up the House and Senate of the United 
              States include, at best, a collection of rogues, con artists, scofflaws 
              and bad check artists. At worst, they comprise, as Twain once observed, 
              a distinct criminal class.<br/>
</p>
<p>Over the past several months, researchers for <i>PoliticsLive</i> 
              have checked public records, past newspaper articles, civil court 
              cases and criminal records of members of the United States Congress. 
              We have talked with former associates and business partners who 
              have been left out in the cold by people they thought were friends.<br/>
</p>
<p>What emerges from this examination is a disturbing portrait of 
              a group of elected officials who routinely avoid payment of debts, 
              write bad checks, abuse their spouses, assault people and openly 
              violate the law.<br/>
</p>
<p>They include current Rep. Corrine Brown (D-Fla), whose trail of 
              bad debts, lies to Congress and misstatements to the Internal Revenue 
              Service have spawned a number of investigations. Then there is Rep. 
              James Moran (D-Va) whose wife has charged him with abuse, who has 
              assaulted other members of Congress on the floor of the House and 
              is a former stockbroker whose judgment in trades is so bad he is 
              broke from poor investments. The list also includes Joe Waldholtz, 
              a con man and husband of former Rep. Enid Greene Waldholtz (R-UT) 
              who kited more than a million dollars in bad checks and ended up 
              in prison.<br/>
</p>
<p>Others, like former Ohio Senator John Glenn, have driven creditors 
              into bankruptcy because of unpaid debts left over from aborted Presidential 
              campaigns. Even millionaire Senator Ted Kennedy has left a trail 
              of unpaid debts from past campaigns.<br/>
</p>
<p>In recent years, members of Congress have gone to jail for child 
              molestation, fraud and other charges.</p>
<p>Our research found 117 members of the House and Senate who have 
              run at least two businesses each that went bankrupt, often leaving 
              business partners and creditors holding the bag. Seventy-one of 
              them have credit reports so bad they can't get an American Express 
              card (but as members of Congress, they get a government-issued Amex 
              card without a credit check).<br/>
</p>
<p>Fifty-three have personal and financial problems so serious they 
              would be denied security clearances by the Department of Defense 
              or the Department of Energy if they had to apply through normal 
              channels (but, again, as members of Congress they get such clearances 
              simply because they fooled enough people to get elected).<br/>
</p>
<p>Twenty-nine members of Congress have been accused of spousal abuse 
              in either criminal or civil proceedings. Twenty-seven have driving 
              while intoxicated arrests on their driving records. Twenty-one are 
              current defendants in various lawsuits, ranging from bad debts, 
              disputes with business partners or other civil matters.<br/>
</p>
<p>Nineteen members of Congress have been accused of writing bad checks, 
              even after the scandal several years ago, which resulted in closure 
              of the informal House bank that routinely allowed members to overdraw 
              their accounts without penalty. Fourteen members of Congress have 
              drug-related arrests in their background, eight were arrested for 
              shoplifting, seven for fraud, four for theft, three for assault 
              and one for criminal trespass.<br/>
</p>
<p>Over the next five days, <i>PoliticsLive</i> will take a closer 
              look at some of the more notorious members of <i>America's Criminal 
              Class - the Congress of the United States</i>. We will not run lists 
              of every member who has written a bad check, punched somebody out 
              or been charged with slapping a spouse. Rather, we will examine 
              those whose pattern of behavior suggests a blatant disregard for 
              both law and propriety. <br/>
</p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><font color="#FF0000">Part 
              I: Rep. Corrine Brown - running on a record of fraud<br/>
</font> </b> </font> </p>
<p><b>In just seven years in Congress</b>, Rep. Corrine Brown has 
              eluded creditors, filed false financial disclosure reports and lied 
              to the Internal Revenue Service.</p>
<p>"She cons people, pure and simple," says Sheryl Wilson, 
              a former travel agency owner in Tallahassee who knew Brown. "I 
              don't think she has an honest bone in her body."<br/>
</p>
<p>Rep. Brown has a poor memory when it comes to remembering her business 
              dealings. The financial records that every member of Congress is 
              required to file shows the Jacksonville, Florida Democrat failed 
              to disclose the $40,000 sale of her Tallahassee travel agency and 
              improperly reported the sale of her Gainesville agency. And she 
              has omitted other required details from her reports.<br/>
</p>
<p>Brown has left a trail of unpaid bills from businesses she owned 
              in Gainesville, Jacksonville and Tallahassee during the early 1990s. 
              <br/>
              In 1994, a consortium of airlines sued Brown for $94,000 in because 
              her company, Springfield Travel Agency Inc., falsified sales reports 
              and did not pay its bills. Delta Air Lines revoked her authority 
              to write tickets because of an unpaid $7,237 bill. She also owed 
              $5,697 to the University of Florida and tried to pay part of the 
              bill with a bad check. <br/>
</p>
<p>The IRS also went after Brown for $14,228 in unpaid taxes and the 
              Whirlpool Corp. had to go to court to try and collect $10,227 in 
              unpaid bills for appliances. <br/>
</p>
<p>In addition, the House ethics committee is investigating Brown 
              over her dealings with an African millionaire who was imprisoned 
              on bribery charges. Two committee investigators went to Miami recently 
              to interview witnesses for that case. <br/>
</p>
<p>Brown not only avoids personal responsibility for her financial 
              dealings, but also routinely violates congressional rules and the 
              law. <br/>
              Members of Congress are required to file reports to reveal any potential 
              conflicts of interest. As a member of the House aviation subcommittee, 
              Brown oversees the very airlines that sued her for unpaid bills. 
              <br/>
</p>
<p>But Brown not only fails to truthfully report transactions involving 
              her travel business, she also spends money she never reports and 
              buys expensive homes and other items even though she is deeply in 
              debt. Although she recently paid $25,000 for a down payment on a 
              $300,000 townhouse, those who know her say they have no idea where 
              she got the money.</p>
<p>"Somebody is always bailing her out," says a former staff 
              member. "You can bet the money came from sources nobody wants 
              to discuss."<br/>
</p>
<p>Members who file incomplete or false reports face criminal charges 
              under federal law. Republican George Hansen of Idaho went to prison 
              for 11 months in 1984 and paid a $40,000 for failing to report more 
              than $300,000 in loans and profits. <br/>
</p>
<p>Last year, Brown's daughter received a $50,000 car from a close 
              associate of the African millionaire who faces bribery charges. 
              <br/>
              Brown's financial dealings show a long, consistent record of deceit.<br/>
</p>
<p>In 1985, she started a travel agency, Springfield Travel, while 
              serving as a Florida state legislator. Papers she filed with the 
              Florida Department of State, listed two prominent state legislators 
              as her vice presidents-Reps. Doug "Tim" Jamerson of St. 
              Petersburg and James Hargrett of Tampa. <br/>
</p>
<p>But Jamerson or Hargrett say didn't know they were affiliated with 
              her company until years later. <br/>
</p>
<p>"I was somewhat surprised to learn I was even on the board," 
              said Jamerson, now a Tallahassee lobbyist. "It would have been 
              nice to have been asked." <br/>
</p>
<p>Brown opened the agency's first office in her hometown of Jacksonville 
              and started a second office in Tallahassee where she spend most 
              of her time while serving in the Legislature. <br/>
</p>
<p>Brown often used the agency to take advantage of the free trips 
              offered to travel agents. <br/>
</p>
<p>"She was always getting tickets to Aruba and places like that," 
              former employee Ed Curry told <i>The St. Petersburg Times</i>. <br/>
</p>
<p>But while Brown was running off to Aruba on free trips, creditors 
              were calling to ask why they weren't getting paid. <br/>
</p>
<p>Brown occasionally paid her employees in cash or wrote personal 
              checks to cover payroll, Curry said. More than once, the paychecks 
              bounced. <br/>
</p>
<p>Brown also failed to pay unemployment taxes to the state. The State 
              Department of Labor filed a $353 state tax lien against the company. 
              As of last week, the lien had not been paid. <br/>
</p>
<p>Even though she couldn't pay her bills, Brown sought to expand 
              her company in 1991. <br/>
</p>
<p>Barnett Bank gave her a $10,000 loan, but could never get a full 
              accounting of how it was spent. At the same time, Brown started 
              a new company, Springfield Enterprises, which she said would resell 
              appliances and seafood. <br/>
</p>
<p>Whirlpool Corp. filed suit against Springfield Enterprises for 
              an unpaid $10,227 bill, saying Brown bought more than a dozen large 
              appliances and didn't pay for them. Brown finally paid the bill 
              after the company obtained a judgment. <br/>
</p>
<p>But Brown was busy opening other businesses. In February 1992, 
              she opened Gator Travel at the University of Florida in Gainesville. 
              <br/>
              Seven months later, she was five months behind in her rent and owed 
              the university $7,066. The IRS also filed a lien against Springfield 
              Travel for $14,228 in unpaid taxes. Brown, who was running for her 
              first term in Congress, was busy looking for someone to buy the 
              travel agency. <br/>
</p>
<p>Two buyers-Melvin Stith, dean of the Florida State University business 
              school, and Edward Scott II, a Tallahassee dentist, paid her $40,000 
              for the agency, according to a contract filed with the state. Brown 
              did not report the sale on her mandatory congressional disclosure, 
              which required her to list sales of all assets worth more than $1,000. 
              <br/>
</p>
<p>The cash allowed her to make payments on some of her debts. The 
              University of Florida got a personal check for the overdue $8,479 
              bill. The IRS withdrew the lien against her in March 1993. <br/>
</p>
<p>But Brown was soon in trouble again<br/>
</p>
<p>In February 1993, she wrote the University of Florida a check for 
              $1,413 - partial payment for a $5,600 bill.<br/>
</p>
<p>The check bounced. <br/>
</p>
<p>A month later, Delta Air Lines revoked her authority to write tickets 
              because of an unpaid $7,237 bill, a move that effectively put her 
              travel agency out of business (Delta was the primary airline serving 
              Gainesville). <br/>
</p>
<p>Enter three Miami businessmen who were willing to take over her 
              failing travel agency. <br/>
</p>
<p>Emilio F. Torres and his partners at Douglas Executive Travel agreed 
              to pay Brown's overdue rent to the university and take over the 
              agency, but the transition to Torres' company took more than six 
              months because Brown owed the airlines so much money. Finally, the 
              airlines seized Brown's official ticketing plates and Torres was 
              allowed to take over the lease. <br/>
</p>
<p>Brown, however, lied about the transaction on her financial disclosure 
              reports to the House of Representatives. Her 1993 report claims 
              Torres bought her agency for an amount between $50,000 and $100,000. 
              Since then, her reports claim she is owed $50,000 to $100,000 by 
              Torres and his partners. <br/>
</p>
<p>But Torres never bought Gator Travel. He just assumed the lease. 
              <br/>
</p>
<p>"We didn't buy anything from her," he says. "I don't 
              owe her anything." <br/>
              State records support his claims. <br/>
</p>
<p>Torres also did not pay Brown's overwhelming unpaid debts to the 
              airlines. <br/>
</p>
<p>The Airlines Reporting Corp., a consortium of the airlines that 
              handles ticket transactions with travel agencies, filed a lawsuit 
              against Brown in U.S. District Court in Washington in September, 
              1994 (while Brown was running for her second term), saying Brown 
              failed to pay about $94,000 for plane tickets and lied about her 
              financial transactions. <br/>
              Brown eventually paid the $94,000 and the suit was dismissed. <br/>
</p>
<p>But Brown never reported the debts on her disclosure forms. Florida 
              state records show she signed a contract in 1992 taking personal 
              responsibility for the bills. <br/>
</p>
<p>Her disclosure forms also fail to show where she got the $94,000 
              to pay off the airlines. Her 1994 form said she didn't have enough 
              money to make the payment. <br/>
</p>
<p>Her latest report shows no savings accounts, no money market funds 
              and no stocks that she could redeem. The only asset she listed is 
              a Jacksonville condo that she rents. <br/>
</p>
<p>Yet she still hasn't paid back the money she borrowed from Barnett 
              Bank in 1991 and has mortgages on a $110,000 waterfront house in 
              Jacksonville and the $300,000 Alexandria, Va., townhouse she recently 
              bought with her daughter. <br/>
</p>
<p>Nobody seems to know where Brown got the $25,000 down payment for 
              the townhouse. Brown's daughter, a political appointee for the Environmental 
              Protection Agency, said in her financial disclosure report that 
              she didn't have any assets over $1,000.</p>
<p>"She's always pulling a scam on someone," says Oliver 
              Roster of Jacksonville, who has known Brown for years. "Somebody, 
              somewhere, got the money for her. What we don't know yet is what 
              she had to do or promise to get it."<br/>
</p>
<p>Brown also forgot to disclose a $10,000 check she received in 1996 
              from a secret Wisconsin bank account Baptist leader Henry J. Lyons 
              allegedly used for money laundering.<font face="arial, arial, helvetica">
</font></p>
<p>The money came from a secret account in Milwaukee that is a focus 
              of charges against Lyons. Federal prosecutors say Lyons, president 
              of the National Baptist Convention USA, hid more than $1 million 
              in the account.</p>
<p>Brown's office did not return phone calls seeking comment on this 
              report. </p>
