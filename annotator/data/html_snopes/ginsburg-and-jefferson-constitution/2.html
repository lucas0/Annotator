<h3 align="center">The Founding Fathers on Arms</h3>
<p>"Firearms stand next in importance to the constitution itself.  They are the American people's liberty teeth and keystone under independence … from the hour the Pilgrims landed to the present day, events, occurences and tendencies prove that to ensure peace security and happiness, the rifle and pistol are equally indispensable … the very atmosphere of firearms anywhere restrains evil interference — they deserve a place of honor with all that's good."<br/><i>George Washington</i><br/>
First President of the United States </p><hr width="60%"/>
<p>"The supposed quietude of a good man allures the ruffian; while on the other hand arms, like laws, discourage and keep the invader and plunderer in awe, and preserve order in the world as property.  The same balance would be preserved were all the world destitute of arms, for all would be alike; but since some will not, others dare not lay them aside … Horrid mischief would ensue were the law-abiding deprived of the use of them."<br/><i>Thomas Paine</i></p><hr width="60%"/>

<p>"Are we at last brought to such humiliating and debasing degradation, that we cannot be trusted with arms for our defense?  Where is the difference between having our arms in possession and under our direction and having them under the management of Congress?  If our defense be the real object of having those arms, in whose hands can they be trusted with more propriety, or equal safety to us, as in our own hands?"<br/><i>Patrick Henry</i><br/>

American Statesman </p><hr width="60%"/>
<h3 align="center">Later Quotes on Gun Control</h3>
<p>"The ruling class doesn't care about public safety. Having made it very difficult for States and localities to police themselves, having left ordinary citizens with no choice but to protect themselves as best they can, they now try to take our guns away. In fact they blame us and our guns for crime. This is so wrong that it cannot be an honest mistake."<br/><i>Malcolm Wallop</i><br/>
former U.S. Sen. (R-WY) </p><hr width="60%"/>
<p>"An armed man is a citizen.  A disarmed man is a subject."<br/><i>Anon.</i><br/>
