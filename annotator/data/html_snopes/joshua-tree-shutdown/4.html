Joshua tree is a Mojave Desert endemic [<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#99">99</a>]. Its distribution follows the 
Mojave Desert boundary in southern Nevada, southwestern 
Utah, western Arizona, southeastern California, and northern Baja California 
Norte [<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#21">21</a>,<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#50">50</a>,<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#51">51</a>,<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#76">76</a>,<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#77">77</a>,<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#111">111</a>]. <i>Yucca</i> <i>b</i>. var. <i>brevifolia</i> and <i>Y</i>.
<i>b</i>. var. <i>jaegeriana</i> occur in the Mojave Desert's western and  northeastern portions, 
respectively [<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#92">92</a>]. Southern Nevada's Tickapoo Valley  is the only reported area where 
distributions<i> </i>of <i>Y</i>. <i>b</i>. var. <i>brevifolia </i>and
<i>Y</i>. <i>b</i>. var. <i>jaegeriana</i> overlap [<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#88">88</a>]. The

Joshua tree is recognized in several vegetation types, but while often a visual 
dominant, it is rarely a true dominant in terms of abundance. Its 
density is low in Joshua tree woodlands and blackbrush (<i>Coleogyne ramosissima</i>) scrub 
communities of the eastern Mohave Desert [<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#28">28</a>]. Rowlands [<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#88">88</a>] suggests that 
recognition of a Joshua tree woodland community type is 
erroneous, and points out that Joshua tree woodlands in Joshua Tree National Park are entirely 
different from Joshua tree woodlands in California's Eureka Valley. 

<p>In the northern part of the Mojave Desert, Joshua tree is associated with 
Great Basin species, and in the southern Mojave, Joshua tree is found with 
characteristic Mojave and Sonoran desert species [<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#65">65</a>]. Often, perennial grasses are the dominants in Joshua tree stands. 
In the western Mojave, desert needlegrass (<i>Achnatherum speciosum</i>) and 
Indian ricegrass (<i>A. hymenoides</i>) are 
common dominant associates. In the eastern Mojave Desert, western Arizona, and Joshua Tree 
National Park, big galleta (<i>Pleuraphis rigida</i>) and black grama (<i>Bouteloua eriopoda</i>) are dominant in Joshua tree 
stands, while galleta (<i>P. jamesii</i>) and blue grama (<i>B. gracilis</i>) 
dominate Joshua tree stands in northern parts of the eastern Mojave and in the 
Great Basin [<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#88">88</a>]. Other common Joshua tree associates in Joshua Tree National 
Park include California juniper (<i>Juniperus californica</i>), singleleaf pinyon (<i>Pinus monophylla</i>), 
shrub live oak (<i>Quercus turbinella</i>), blackbrush, 
green ephedra (<i>Ephedra viridis</i>), eastern Mojave buckwheat (<i>Eriogonum fasciculatum</i>), 
white burrobrush (<i>Hymenoclea salsola</i>), bladdersage (<i>Salazaria mexicana</i>), and 
Mojave desertrue (<i>Thamnosma montana</i>) [<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#85">85</a>].</p>

exceeding 40 feet (10 m) are rare, and height is easily overestimated [<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#51">51</a>,<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#62">62</a>,<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#72">72</a>,<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#76">76</a>,<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#77">77</a>].

Typically 
trees have 1 main stout stem that  measures 1 to 3 feet (0.3-0.9 m) in diameter 
and have an expanded base [<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#21">21</a>,<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#50">50</a>,<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#56">56</a>,<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#106">106</a>,<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#108">108</a>].

Trunks are fibrous, and 
the bark or periderm is "soft and cork like" 
[<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#55">55</a>,<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#66">66</a>,<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#92">92</a>].

<p>Branching is often extensive on old plants, and 
rounded open crowns are common [<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#37">37</a>,<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#50">50</a>,<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#62">62</a>,<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#92">92</a>]. Young trees 
typically lack branches and are covered with persistent reflexed leaves [<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#106">106</a>]. Trees 
normally reach 3 to 9 feet (0.9-3 m) tall before  branching [<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#66">66</a>]. Johnson [<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#47">47</a>] 
describes Joshua tree branching as "grotesque" and 
random. However, branching is formally referred to as 
<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/../../../glossary2.html#dichotomous">dichotomous</a> 
or almost dichotomous. Branches are formed following terminal bud death due to flowering or insect

Branches are often 7 to 20 feet (2-5 m) or  longer and 
fork at 2- to 3-foot (0.6-0.9 m) intervals. Inner branches are typically erect, 
and outer branches can be horizontal or drooping [<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#21">21</a>,<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#50">50</a>,<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#62">62</a>,<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#72">72</a>,<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#111">111</a>].</p>
<p>Joshua tree is slow growing and long lived [<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#22">22</a>,<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#62">62</a>]. Wallace and Romney [<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#106">106</a>] 
indicate that height, growth rings, or number of leaf blades may be used to age 
Joshua tree, but they caution that height may not accurately age "very mature" 
plants. Webber [<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#108">108</a>] reports that 21-year-old Joshua trees were unbranched, and 
the average annual growth rate was 5.9 cm/year. Other <i>Y. b.</i> var. <i>jaegeriana</i> 
plants grew an average of 11.7 cm/year. Johnson [<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#47">47</a>] indicates that large trees can be 300 years old, and Keith 
[<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#55">55</a>] suggests that Joshua tree has an average life span of 150 years.  Little [<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#62">62</a>] 
suggests that Joshua tree is among the among the desert's "oldest 
living plants." An approximately 60-foot-tall (20 m) tree in California was an 
estimated 1,000 years old [<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#62">62</a>].</p>
<p>Leaves are clustered in rosettes at the branch ends. Clusters 
are commonly 1 to 5 feet (0.3-1.5 m) long and 1 to 2 feet (0.3-0.5 m) in diameter. 
Leaves are linear, needle shaped and measure 5.9 to 14 inches (15-35 cm) long by 
0.3 to 0.6 inch (0.7-1.5 cm) wide. Enlarged bases attach 
the leaves to the branch. Leaf shape is slightly triangular and leaf margins are 
lined with small teeth. Spines measuring 0.3 to 0.5 inch (7-12 mm) occur at the leaf 
tips [<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#6">6</a>,<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#21">21</a>,<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#37">37</a>,<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#50">50</a>,<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#51">51</a>,<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#62">62</a>,<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#76">76</a>,<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#77">77</a>,<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#108">108</a>,<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#111">111</a>]. Leaf clusters are longer 
(3 to 5 feet (1-1.5 m)) on 
juvenile plants than on mature plants (1-3 feet (0.3-1 m)) [<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#72">72</a>]. 
Outer leaf layers are thick and waxy to reduce water loss [<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#66">66</a>]. Dead 
leaves are persistent and fold down, covering the branches and coating the trunks 
of young trees [<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#47">47</a>].</p>
<p>Joshua tree flowers occur in 
dense, heavy panicles that measure 8 to 20 inches (20-40 cm) long. Individual 
flowers are round to egg shaped and measure 1 to 2 inches (2.5-5 cm) by 0.4 to 
0.8 inch (1-2 cm) wide [<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#21">21</a>,<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#37">37</a>,<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#47">47</a>,<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#51">51</a>,<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#62">62</a>,<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#76">76</a>,<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#77">77</a>,<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#111">111</a>]. 
Fruits are indehiscent capsules, which become spongy and dry with age. 
Egg-shaped capsules are 2 to 4 inches (6-10 cm) long and approximately 2 inches 
(5 cm) in diameter. Fruits  develop at the base of the inflorescence while the 
upper portion is still in flower. Mature fruits contain 30 to 50 seeds, which 
are flat to thickened with smooth to undulate surfaces. Seeds are 0.3 to 0.4 inch 
(7-11 mm) long [<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#3">3</a>,<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#21">21</a>,<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#47">47</a>,<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#50">50</a>,<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#61">61</a>,<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#62">62</a>,<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#72">72</a>,<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#76">76</a>,<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#77">77</a>,<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#108">108</a>]. Fruit clusters often weigh over 9 pounds (4 
kg), while a single capsule frequently weighs over 8.8 ounces (250 g). Fruits borne on erect 
branches are not easily detached [<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#61">61</a>]. Average individual seed 
weight ranged from 0.0025 to 0.0035 ounce (0.07-0.1 g) based on several seed collections in the 
Southwest [<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#3">3</a>]. In Los Angeles County, California, the average fruit length was 2.7

The Joshua tree root system is described as deep 
and extensive [<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#11">11</a>,<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#22">22</a>]. The enlarged trunk base of mature trees can be almost 4 feet 
(1.2 m) in diameter but extends only about 1 foot (0.3 m) into the ground, suggesting 
that Joshua trees are supported mainly by their roots and rhizomes [<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#92">92</a>]. 
A large number of small fibrous roots penetrate down and 
horizontally [<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#56">56</a>]. In southern Utah, Joshua tree roots were found in an excavation pit in a blackbrush 
community when the nearest Joshua tree  was 36 feet (11 m) away [<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#11">11</a>].</p>
<p>Not all Joshua trees produce rhizomes. Rhizome production and clonal growth 
are more common at high elevations [<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#92">92</a>]. See 
<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/#Asexual regeneration:">Asexual regeneration</a> 
for a discussion of possible reasons for rhizome presence or absence.</p>
<p>Newly produced rhizomes are unbranched, succulent, and covered with bud scales. Young rhizomes 
grow and produce aerial stems quickly. After producing aerial stems,  rhizomes become woody 
and hard, lose their bud scales, and may produce lateral branches [<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#92">92</a>,<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#108">108</a>]. The periderm on 
mature rhizomes is thin, 
dense, and hard: not at all corky like the periderm on aboveground stems 
[<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#92">92</a>]. Rhizomes are typically 0.4 to 2 inches (1-5 cm) in diameter and 
grow horizontally approximately 3 feet (1 m) from the parent plant before sending up aerial stems [<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#88">88</a>]. 
Simpson [<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#92">92</a>] reports that rhizomes can be as long as 10 feet (3 m) or more. 
Rhizome diameter is greatest at the base of aboveground shoots, and roots  commonly 
occur along the entire rhizome length. In rocky substrates, irregular rhizome 
growth is common [<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#92">92</a>].</p>
<p><b><font face="Bell MT" size="4">Variability:</font></b>
<i>Yucca b.</i> var. <i>jaegeriana</i> is often generically referred to as dwarf 
Joshua tree and displays true dichotomous branching. This variety is often 
smaller (10 to 20 feet (3-6 m) tall), with shorter leaves (&lt;8.7 inches (22 cm)) 
and shorter branches (2-3 feet (0.7-1 m)), than <i>Y. b.</i> var. <i>brevifolia</i>

is less stocky, often 20 to 40 feet (5-12 m) tall, with longer leaves 
(7.5-15 inches (19-37 cm)) and higher branches (7-10 feet (2-3 m) above 
ground) than <i>Y. b.</i> var. <i>jaegeriana. Yucca</i> <i>b.</i>

Simpson [<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#92">92</a>] indicates that 
<i>Y. b.</i> var. <i>brevifolia</i> trees taller than 70 feet (20 m) have been 
recorded. Growth forms of both varieties may vary with elevation. Joshua 
trees growing below 4,000 feet (1,200 m) are often single-stemmed trees, 
but when growing above 4,000 feet (1,200 m), plants often have many stems 
connected by long, thin, horizontal rhizomes [<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#92">92</a>]. For more information about

<p><font face="Bell MT" size="4"><b><a name="Pollination:">Pollination:</a></b></font> 
Flowers are pollinated by a single species of moth. The yucca moth, <i>Tegeticula synthetica</i>, 
is commonly considered  Joshua tree's pollinator [<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#4">4</a>]. Researchers have discovered 
another Joshua tree pollinator, <i>Tegeticula antithetica</i>, 
in the eastern and northeastern parts of the Mojave Desert where <i>Y. b.</i> var. <i>jaegeriana </i> 
occurs. Distributions of the 2 moth species are not thought to overlap [<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#82">82</a>].  </p>
<p>Many refer to and describe the pollination process, but experiments and true 
observations are lacking as of this writing (2006). It is generally accepted that a female moth emerges 
from her pupa near a Joshua tree plant, mates in a flower, and flies to a freshly opened 
flower. Using specialized mouth parts sometimes referred to as "tentacles," 
she scrapes pollen from the anthers, forms it into a ball, and carries it between 
her tentacles and thorax to another flower. Whether or not the receiving flower 
is on the same inflorescence or tree is often speculated, 
but direct observation is lacking. The female moth penetrates the ovary wall and deposits 1 or more eggs in 
a locule. All eggs may be put in 1 locule or eggs may be distributed among 
several locules. She then pushes the pollen ball into 
the stigmatic tube. Moth larvae feed on the developing Joshua tree seeds [<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#4">4</a>].</p>
<p>When the Joshua tree moth pollinator was introduced into a moth-free area, Lenz 
[<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#61">61</a>] found that moths  dispersed as far as 384 feet (117 m). Force and Thompson 
[<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#31">31</a>] found that <i>Tegeticula synthetica</i> is susceptible to parasitism by endo- and ectoparasites. Parasitized larvae in 
Joshua tree fruit and fruit stalks collected in California's San Gabriel 
Mountains ranged from 12.5% to 82.4% [<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#31">31</a>].</p>
<p><b><font face="Bell MT" size="4">Breeding system:</font></b> 
Joshua tree is chiefly 
<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/../../../glossary2.html#monoecious">monoecious</a>, 
but some perfect flowers are produced 
[<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#83">83</a>]. Some suggest that a period of cold temperatures is necessary for 
flower production [<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#89">89</a>].</p>
<p><b><font face="Bell MT" size="4">Seed production:</font></b> Seed 
production is most often described as periodic or rare [<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#56">56</a>,<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#68">68</a>,<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#113">113</a>]. 
"Wet years" are suggested as best for flowering and 
fruit production [<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#56">56</a>,<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#68">68</a>].</p>
<p>In Los Angeles County, researchers evaluated seed predation by <i>Tegeticula
</i>moth larvae (see <a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/#Pollination:">Pollination</a>). 
The average number of <i>Tegeticula</i> larvae per fruit was 1.4 
in 155 examined fruits. Just 7% of seeds were destroyed. The range of larvae per 
fruit was 0 to 6; 39% of Joshua tree fruit had no larvae. Researchers suggested 
several potential reasons for fruit production without the presence of larvae. Flowers may have 
been self pollinated or pollinated by a vector other than <i>Tegeticula</i>, 
which researchers considered unlikely. Moths may have pollinated the flower but failed to oviposit, or moths laid 
their eggs, but the larvae died [<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#53">53</a>].</p>
<p>Seed production may also be affected by small mammal predation. California 
ground squirrels climb Joshua trees and consume the fleshy fruits and seeds, thus 
destroying some of the seed crop [<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#61">61</a>]. Went [<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#113">113</a>] predicts that 99% of Joshua 
tree seeds are consumed by rodents or moth larvae; however, experiments or 
observations leading to this assertion are not described.</p>

Joshua tree seeds are dispersed by mammals and wind. As fruits become overmature, skins crack and moisture is 
released, making fruits lighter and more easily wind dispersed [<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#61">61</a>,<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#92">92</a>]. 
Finding clumps of 2 or more seedlings is likely evidence that the dried 
fruits were wind dispersed [<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#61">61</a>].</p>
<p>White-tailed antelope squirrels collect overripe dry fruits and crack the coating, 
consuming some seeds and allowing others  to fall to the ground. It is common 
to find broken fruits and seeds at the bases of Joshua trees. It has been suggested 
that the large effort in fruit production by Joshua tree without a 
specialized dispersal agent may indicate that this type of fruit production is 
an evolutionarily old trait designed to attract a now extinct megaherbivore dispersal agent. 
The researcher suggests elephants. However, with current dispersal means, 
young or juvenile plants have been found as far as 495 feet (151 m) from a seed-producing plant in Los 
Angeles County. A maximum dispersal distance of 823 feet 
(251 m) was recorded in San Bernardino County [<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#61">61</a>].</p>
<p><font face="Bell MT" size="4"><b>Seed banking:</b></font> 
Longevity of seed in the soil seed bank is unknown. Joshua tree seeds collected in Arizona were stored 
under artificial conditions, and germination was 98% 
and 72% after 6 months and 1.5 years of storage, respectively [<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#71">71</a>].</p>
<p><b><font face="Bell MT" size="4"><a name="Germination:">Germination:</a>
</font></b> Joshua tree seeds germinate readily in the laboratory and do not 
require any pretreatment [<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#1">1</a>,<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#106">106</a>]. 
Joshua tree seeds may germinate any time after being shed and 
receiving moisture. Because of seed predation by rodents, Went [<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#112">112</a>] suggests 
that the best chance for successful germination is immediately after falling.</p>
<p>Seeds collected in Joshua Tree National Park germinated well in the laboratory at 68°F (20°C) and 
77 °F (25 °C) [<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#112">112</a>]. Controlled seed germination experiments from collections made 
at the Nevada Test Site indicate that germination was best at 64 °F (18 °C) 
compared to germination at 50 °F (10 °C) and 95 °F (35 °C) [<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#106">106</a>]. Viability of 25 Joshua tree seeds collected from 
native habitats was 96%, and of 50 seeds kept on moist filter paper, 24% produced 
seedlings [<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#3">3</a>]. Joshua tree seeds, collected in Arizona and kept in a dark 
laboratory, showed 0% initial germination at 50 °F (10 °C); 24% after 8 to 10 days at 59 °F (15 °C); 
100% after 2 to 5 days at 68 °F (20 °C); and 100% after 1 to 2 days at 77 °F (25 °C) [<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#71">71</a>].</p>
<p>Short durations of hot temperatures may increase Joshua tree germination. 
Germination percentages of seed, collected from several Joshua tree populations in 
the Mojave Desert and subjected to heat treatments, are provided below. Germination

<p><font face="Bell MT" size="4"><b>Seedling establishment/growth:</b></font> 
Quantity of Joshua tree seedlings observed in the field varies. Yeaton and 
others [<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#116">116</a>] report numerous Joshua tree seedlings in the eastern Mojave. Went [<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#112">112</a>] 
observed seedlings in Joshua Tree National Park, but abundance was not 
reported. Wallace and Romney [<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#106">106</a>] report few seedlings at the Nevada Test Site, 
and population structure observations suggested that successful seedling 
establishment may occur only a few times each century in the area. These differences may be 
related to site variation, observation timing,  climate differences, and/or 
observation effort. Seedlings are easily concealed by nurse plants [<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#61">61</a>], and seedling predation by black-tailed jackrabbits 
is common in Lanfair Valley, California (Griffith, 
personal communication cited in [<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#61">61</a>]), suggesting that effort and timing may be crucial 
to finding Joshua tree seedlings.</p>
<p>Seedling growth rates and production vary with age, temperature, and 
photoperiod. In Joshua Tree National Park, unbranched seedlings grew at an average rate of 3 
inches (7.6 cm)/year for the first 10 years and an average of 1.5 inches (3.8 
cm)/year thereafter [<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#55">55</a>]. Yucca (<i>Yucca</i> spp.) seedlings grown from seed collected from several native populations 
produced their 1st few leaves rapidly, then produced, on average, 1 new leaf every 2 months. Along with 
a decreased rate of leaf production was an increase in leaf size. Twenty-two-day-old 
seedlings had an average of 4 leaves [<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#3">3</a>]. Based on studies at the Nevada Test 
Site, Wallace [<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#106">106</a>] indicated that Joshua tree seedlings that survive 3 to 5 
years are established.</p>
<p>Went [<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#113">113</a>,<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#114">114</a>] suggests that cold periods are required for optimal seedling 
growth. Seedlings  (3.5 years of age) kept at 40 °F (4 
°C) for 2 months produced twice as many new leaves as seedlings 
without the cold treatment, even though there was no new growth 
produced during the 2-month cold period [<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#113">113</a>,<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#114">114</a>].</p>
<p>McCleary [<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#71">71</a>] found that day length affected 
the growth of seedlings grown from seed collected in Arizona. Seedlings grown with 
10 hours of daylight and 14 hours of dark produced on average the longest and 
most leaves (<span style="text-decoration: overline">x</span> =15.1); seedlings grown in 16 hours of daylight and 8 hours of 
dark produced the shortest and fewest leaves (<span style="text-decoration: overline">x</span>

<p><font face="Bell MT" size="4">Nurse plants:</font> In the Spring and Sheep mountain ranges 
of southern Nevada, shrub species, 
especially blackbrush, provide important Joshua tree seedling habitat. Joshua 
tree stands on study sites were between 3,000 and 7,000 feet (1,000-2,000 m). In sixteen 100
<font face="Times New Roman">×</font> 50 m-sites, researchers located a total of
277 seedlings. Of these, 257 grew under the canopy of some other 
shrub, even though  shrub coverage averaged just 20.1 % in the area. The 
majority of seedlings occurred at 5,200 foot (1,600 m) elevation, and 71% of all canopy 
seedlings grew under blackbrush. White bursage (<i>Ambrosia dumosa</i>), 
spiny hopsage (<i>Grayia spinosa</i>), and 
range ratany (<i>Krameria parvifolia</i>) also had more Joshua tree seedlings beneath their canopy than expected 
based on available canopy area or density. Researchers suggested that seedlings growing under 
shrub canopies experience increased soil moisture, decreased insolation, reduced soil 
temperatures, decreased evapotranspiration, increased nutrients, decreased 
herbivory, and/or lower wind desiccation. For more on the effects of site

as certain environmental conditions, may encourage rhizome production and clonal 
growth [<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#108">108</a>]. It is common for dormant buds beneath the periderm to grow when 
old stems bend or stems are injured. Joshua trees with extensive rhizome growth 
and clonal form are typically shorter and have less branching than single-stemmed trees. 
In some cases basal buds do not develop into distinct rhizomes, 
and stems grow adjacent to the main stem as sprouts [<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#92">92</a>].</p>
<p>Several Joshua tree populations in

form dense "impenetrable thickets" 
[<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#12">12</a>]. From the southern and western slopes of Tehachapi Mountains to at 
least Monolith, California, some Joshua trees occur in clumps nearly 30 feet (8 
m) in diameter, with 30 to 40 trunk-like stems. Plants with this growth form 
were once classified as
<i>Y</i>. <i>b</i>. var. <i>herbertii </i>[<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#108">108</a>]. 
Simpson [<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#92">92</a>] found a single clone in Gorman Creek, California, that occupied approximately 1 acre

[<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#92">92</a>] report that the extent of cloning increases with increased elevation. Webber [<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#108">108</a>] 
indicates that in low-elevation dry areas Joshua tree rarely forms more than 
1 or 2 stems, but 2 to 3 stems are common, and some 
clumps are found, in higher, moister areas. Cold temperatures, high 
winds, and abundant snowfall, common at high-elevation sites, may "restrict aerial 
development" thereby "necessitating elaboration of underground portions," 
according to Simpson [<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#92">92</a>]. The 
extensive clone in Gorman Creek occurred at approximately 3,000 feet (910 m) 
in "montane" weather conditions with high levels of winter

Joshua tree occurs in hot, dry sites on flats, mesas, bajadas, and gentle slopes in 
the Mojave Desert, which is 
often described as a transition zone or 
ecotone, much like the Great Basin Desert in its northern parts and like the 
Sonoran Desert in its southern parts [<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#21">21</a>,<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#37">37</a>,<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#47">47</a>,<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#67">67</a>,<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#76">76</a>,<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#77">77</a>,<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#89">89</a>,<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#102">102</a>,<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#111">111</a>].

<p><b><font face="Bell MT" size="4">Climate:</font></b> 
Joshua tree survives in areas with 
cold winters, hot summers, and little precipitation. Several researchers 
indicate that Joshua tree is restricted to areas with cold winter temperatures 
[<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#25">25</a>,<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#89">89</a>]. A dormant period is considered 
"essential" for Joshua tree [<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#55">55</a>]. Leaves collected from Joshua 
trees in Joshua Tree National Park survived minimum 
and maximum temperatures of 12 °F (-11 °C) and 140 °F (59 °C), respectively 
[<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#93">93</a>]. Lenz [<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#61">61</a>] reports that plants tolerate 
temperatures of -13 °F (-25 °C) to 120 °F (51°C) and annual precipitation ranges of 
3.9 to 10.6 inches (98-268 mm). Hughes [<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#39">39</a>] reports that summer temperatures often reach 120 
°F (51°C), annual precipitation ranges from 3 inches (80 mm) in dry years to 14 inches 
(360 mm) in El Niño 
years, and droughts are typical from May to July in the Mojave Desert. Joshua tree woodlands in southern California 
receive 6 to 15 inches (150-380 mm) of precipitation annually, and some comes in the summer months [<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#76">76</a>].</p>
<p>In Joshua tree-blackbrush communities in Utah's Washington County, the number of days with temperatures above 
105 °F (40.5 °C) was a low of 8 in 1970 and a high of 15 in 1971 over 
the course of a 3-year study (1969-1971). The 
lowest temperature recorded was 4.5 °F (-15.3 °C). Most precipitation came from 
November through March. In 23 years the 
average annual precipitation ranged from a low of 3.7 inches (93 mm) to 
a high of 16.9 inches (428 mm)  [<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#11">11</a>]. Welsh and others 
[<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#111">111</a>] indicate that Joshua tree  grows successfully 
as far north as Salt Lake City, Utah.</p>
<p><b><font face="Bell MT" size="4">Elevation:</font></b> 
Lower elevational limits increase with Joshua tree's more northerly distribution. This phenomenon is 
likely due to a complex interaction of precipitation and 
evapotranspiration [<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#88">88</a>]. Joshua tree occurs within

<p>In a study of Joshua tree-blackbrush communities in Utah's Washington County, 
soils were predominantly shallow sandy loams. The pH 
was approximately 8, and soils had low organic matter. Based on a 3-year period,
<font face="Times New Roman">soil temperatures ranged from a high of 110 °F (46 °C) at

<br/>

The concept of succession, in which community composition changes over time as a 
site is modified by past and present species, was developed in mesic eastern 
forests and does not apply well to southwestern desert 
ecosystem dynamics. In eastern forest ecosystems, pioneer species are 
typically not present in climax communities. In southwestern deserts, species that make up 
the predisturbed vegetation are the same species that make up the recovering 
vegetation [<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#74">74</a>]. Vegetational change in desert systems may be better 
described as "parasuccession." While true Clementsion succession does not occur in 
semiarid and arid ecosystems, it is possible to see shifts in species dominance 
in relation to disturbance. Complete recovery after "denudation" can take 
centuries or millennia, and this long process has not been extensively studied  in desert communities [<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#87">87</a>].<p></p>
<p>Based on the few studies that compare pre- and postdisturbance communities in 
Joshua tree habitats, it is generally true that Joshua tree abundance is often 
less in disturbed than undisturbed communities. In a Nevada study, old roads of Wahmonie ghost 
town had not been traveled for 33 years. Joshua tree was absent from  old roads and occurred only on less disturbed 
adjacent sites [<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#109">109</a>].  Joshua tree density was much greater on undisturbed sites than on old-field 
sites on eastern Mojave Desert uplands. Fields were abandoned 
approximately 65 years ago, and of 10 old-field sites, just 1 had Joshua tree 
density that was not significantly (p&lt;0.01) lower than undisturbed sites. On 
another old-field site, Joshua tree density was nearly 20% of that of 
undisturbed sites, but for all other old-field sites Joshua tree density did not 
exceed 0.5 plant/ha. Density of Joshua tree on undisturbed sites 
averaged 75 plants/ha [<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#20">20</a>].</p>
<p>In California, Brooks and Matchett [<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#16">16</a>] 
compared burned and unburned sites in blackbrush communities in the Mohave Desert 
that had burned 6 to 14 years prior to the study period. Cover of woody 
perennials was 60% lower on burned than unburned sites, and annual forb cover was

Vigorous postfire

Joshua tree dies if burned [<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#14">14</a>]. Establishment from off-site seed is another

<p><font face="Bell MT" size="4"><b>Fire regimes: </b></font>
Presettlement fire history in the Mojave Desert is largely unknown [<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#42">42</a>]. Many 
researchers have speculated on the frequency or occurrence of fire in desert 
ecosystems based on vegetation patterns and fuel structure. In 
creosotebush-white bursage communities, the open stand structure does not carry fire well except 
when high annual herbaceous production follows remarkably heavy winter rainfall. 
The ordinarily low forb and grass cover in blackbrush communities suggests that 
high temperatures and wind speeds and low relative humidity are necessary for 
burning [<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#42">42</a>]. In 1930 Bauer [<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#7">7</a>] reported that fire was probably  not an important influence in desert vegetation 
of California's Tehachapi Mountains, where Joshua tree is often important.</p>
<p>Leary [<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#58">58</a>] suggests 3  reasons that fires were historically rarer in 
southwestern deserts than in  other ecosystems. Vegetation spacing in the deserts did not 
promote fire spread. Litter and fuel levels were low in the deserts, and 
lastly, deserts were sparsely populated and had a reduced chance of human-caused fires. However, 
invasive species have changed the fuel and litter loads (see
<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/#Changes in fire frequency and size with nonnatives:">Changes in fire frequency and size with nonnatives</a>), 
and human-caused fires have become more common (see study in 
<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/#Joshua tree density">Discussion and Qualification of Plant Response</a> 
by [<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#60">60</a>]). Loik and others [<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#64">64</a>] report that the current fire return interval for singleleaf 
pinyon-California juniper communities of Quail Mountain in Joshua Tree National 
Park is approximately 15 years.</p>
<p><font face="Bell MT" size="4"><a name="Changes in fire frequency and size with nonnatives:">Changes in fire frequency and size with nonnatives:</a></font> 
It is well documented that increases in 
herbaceous nonnative vegetation, namely cheatgrass (<i>Bromus tectorum</i>) and red brome (<i>B. madritensis</i>), 
have facilitated 
increased fire incidence and fire size in the Mojave and Great Basin deserts 
since the mid 20th century. At the Nevada Test Site, researchers have been 
surveying plants since 1957. Red brome and cheatgrass have increased in 
density and frequency since 1957. The density of cheatgrass or red brome reached 
1,000 plants/m² by 1988 [<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#44">44</a>]. Following the very wet winter of 2004 to 2005 in Nevada's Delamar 
Valley, Joshua tree on unburned sites grew in dense cheatgrass up to 20 inches 
(60 cm) tall. In the Mohave-Great Basin desert transition zone, cheatgrass and 
red brome promote previously uncharacteristic large fires by filling in the shrub interspaces 
that once retarded fire spread in arid ecosystems [<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#26">26</a>].</p>
<p>In the western Mojave desert of California, nonnative annual grasses (red brome, 
cheatgrass, and Mediterranean grasses (<i>Schismus </i>spp.)) and forbs (chiefly, 
cutleaf filaree (<i>Erodium cicutarium</i>)) 
may comprise over 50% of the  biomass. Fires are more frequent, since these 
nonnative species have altered the fuel structure and subsequent fire behavior 
in what was a relatively fire-resistant landscape. Nonnative annual grass stems 
are persistent, and nonnative litter decomposes slowly, providing fuel for 
frequent fires. Red brome contributed to substantial increases in fire frequency 
in the Mojave and Colorado deserts of California since the 1970s. From 
1980 to 1995, 77% of the total BLM-managed Mojave Desert areas burned. 
Approximately 25% of the fires were started by lightning, while the other  75% were human caused. 
Most fires burned in the summer (May-September), and most 
fires in BLM-managed areas of the Colorado Desert burned along the Mojave 
Desert ecotone near Joshua Tree National Park [<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#14">14</a>,<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#15">15</a>].</p>
<p>Fires were rare in Joshua Tree National Park until about 1965. Since the 
establishment of red brome and cheatgrass, fires have become more frequent and 
more severe. Before 1965 most lightning fires burned less than 0.25 acre (0.1 
ha). In 1979 the Quail Mountain Fire burned 6,000 acres. In 1995, the Covington Fire 
burned 5,158 acres (2,087 ha), and 4 years later 13,894 acres (5,623 ha) of Joshua Tree National Park 
burned [<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#34">34</a>].</p>

  tree varieties [<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#26">26</a>].
  
</p><p>If killed by fire, Joshua tree recolonization depends on off-site seed sources [<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#18">18</a>]. The 
current available literature (2006) does not address effects of fire on 
Joshua tree seed. In the laboratory, however, germination of Joshua tree seeds collected from several 
Mojave Desert populations was tested following heat  treatments. Germination after 5 minutes at 
190 °F (90 °C) was significantly higher (p&lt;0.01) than for 
untreated seeds [<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#54">54</a>]. For 
a more complete summary of  this study, see 
<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/#Germination:">Germination</a>. 
In Joshua Tree National Park, 
researchers did not find Joshua tree seedlings on burned sites but found many young 
Joshua tree plants within blackbrush canopies on unburned sites. Researchers 
suggested that recovery of blackbrush may be necessary for Joshua tree seedling 
establishment [<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#64">64</a>]. Lenz [<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#61">61</a>] reports that new 
Joshua tree seedlings are easily concealed in nurse plants, which may be an important 
consideration in postfire sampling. The recovery of Joshua tree woodlands to 
prefire conditions may take decades or centuries [<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#26">26</a>].</p>
<p><b><font face="Bell MT" size="4">Sampling issues:</font></b>
In many cases, Joshua tree abundance is low on both burned and unburned sites, and  small 
quadrat understory sampling does not allow for accurate estimations of Joshua 
tree abundance [<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#88">88</a>]. Joshua tree is often missed with small quadrat sampling 
(see results presented in [<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#64">64</a>]). In stands with high Joshua tree density (over 150 
trees/ha),  0.1 to 0.2 ha is an adequate sampling area; in areas 
with low Joshua tree density (&lt;50 trees/ha) a 0.5- 
to 1.0-ha sampling area is recommended. Accurate estimates of Joshua 
tree cover or density typically require a sampling area of at least 0.2 acre (0.1 ha) [<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#88">88</a>].</p>
<p><b><font face="Bell MT" size="4">Postfire sprouting:</font></b> 
According to Emming [<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#26">26</a>], <i>Y</i>. <i>b</i>. var. <i>jaegeriana</i>, which is 
distributed at the upper limits of Joshua tree's range, often 
sprouts following fire. <i>Yucca</i> <i>b</i>. var. <i>brevifolia</i>, found at lower latitudes 
than <i>Y</i>. <i>b</i>. var. <i>jaegeriana</i>,<i> </i>normally  establishes by seed 
on burned sites [<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#26">26</a>].</p>
<p>On the Nevada test sites, rhizome and root crown sprouts were most 
common on mid-size burned trees. Sprouting percentages were lower for smaller- and 
larger-sized trees. The number of sprouts on burned Joshua tree plants was 
evaluated in postfire year 1 after a 20 July lightning fire. Survival of sprouts beyond 
postfire year 1 was not reported. These findings suggest that long-term fire 
protection in Joshua tree stands may affect postfire regeneration strategies. 
Recurrent fires and a complete removal of fire may both be detrimental to Joshua tree 
stands. A summary of postfire sprouting is provided below [<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#43">43</a>]:</p>

DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE:</a>
</span>
<br/>

In the few Joshua tree fire studies published to date (2006), Joshua tree cover or density 
was commonly lower on burned than unburned sites. In 1 case, reduced Joshua tree density on 
burned sites was apparent for 17 years following a severe fire [<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#60">60</a>]. In another case, 
Joshua tree density was equal on burned and unburned sites 10 years 
following fire, and the researcher suggested that early postfire coverage 
of Joshua tree may be greater on burned than unburned sites due to postfire sprouting 
[<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#5">5</a>]. 

<p>Two days after a late June fire in California's San Bernardino County, 
researchers found that some aboveground stems had survived and that rhizomes 
approximately 1 foot (0.3 m) below ground were uninjured. Fire 
characteristics were not described [<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#92">92</a>].</p>
<p>Joshua tree sprouts were observed 1 year following an August fire in Joshua Tree 
National Park. High winds were reported but other fire characteristics were not. 
Three to four sprouts sometimes occurred where a single tree had burned. Sprouts 
were much more common from small Joshua  trees (under 10 feet (3 m)) tall that were 
approximately 5 to 50 years old than from large burned trees. The researcher 
suggested that large trees had more area covered with fire-fueling dead leaves 
and may have burned at a higher temperature than small trees. Mortality was 
greater for large than small trees [<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#5">5</a>].</p>
<p>Researchers found Joshua tree root crown sprouts and canopy sprouts following a 
July 1995 lightning fire in the Lower Covington Flats area of Joshua Tree 
National Park. Twenty-eight percent of Joshua tree plants along five 1,000-m² 
belt transects had root crown sprouts 16 months following fire. Canopy sprouts 
occurred in 4% of the plants, but no plant had both rhizome or root crown and canopy sprouts. 
Researchers speculated that root crown sprouting was likely related to extent of 
tissue death, which was determined by fire temperature [<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#64">64</a>].</p>
<p>Joshua tree was classified as an increaser following fire when burned and unburned 
sites were compared in the Joshua tree woodland-singleleaf pinyon-California 
juniper ecotone in the Victor Valley of the southwestern Mojave Desert. Six 
burned and adjacent unburned sites were evaluated. Sites had burned 
approximately 3 to 13 years earlier in June, July, or August. No other fire 
characteristics were reported. Joshua tree density was determined using 0.025-acre 
quadrats. Density averaged 71 individuals/acre on unburned sites and 142.7 
individuals/acre on burned sites. Frequency of Joshua tree was slightly lower  on burned 
(29.2%) than on unburned (36.3%) sites. The 
clumped nature of postfire sprouts explained the increases in density and decreases in 
frequency. Methods for delineating individual plants for density estimates were 
not reported. Mature trees without shaggy dead leaves at the base of the plant 
had outer periderm exposed, which reduced the chance of fire in the crowns and 
increased the chance of apical meristem survival [<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#96">96</a>].</p>
<p>Researchers found that Joshua tree height and 
basal diameter generally increased with increased time since fire in a study of 
burned sites in Joshua Tree National Park. Visited sites had burned 1 to 28 years 
previously. Sites with longer recovery time had the most Joshua  trees growing 
independently of a nurse plant and the fewest fire surviving plants (identified 
as sprouts in the table). Sites burned 9 to 12 years earlier were a mixture of Joshua tree sprouts and 
seedlings (mostly emerging from the canopy of nearby vegetation), while sites burned 1 
year earlier were populated only by sprouting Joshua trees. Study results are 
summarized below [<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#64">64</a>]:</p>

<p>In Joshua Tree National Park, Joshua tree was absent from early postfire communities, 
but density on burned and unburned sites was equal 10 years following fire.
Joshua tree was only found on unburned sites following an August lightning fire in 
the western part of Joshua Tree National Park. Burned areas were visited 3 
months, 6 months, and 8 months following the fire. Fire characteristics were not 
reported [<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#59">59</a>]. In other studies, Joshua tree density was equal on 10-year-old burned and 
unburned sites in Joshua Tree National 
Park. No information about the fire was provided [<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#5">5</a>]. Joshua tree was 
present on 3 burned sites in the Mojave Desert. Sites had burned 6, 8, and 14 
years earlier. Neither absolute coverage percentages on burned and unburned sites 
nor fire characteristics were 
reported [<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#16">16</a>].</p>
<p><a name="Joshua tree density">Joshua tree density</a>
was greater on unburned than burned sites in southern Nevada's Spring Mountain area. 
Joshua tree was absent from sites burned 8 and 13 years before the study, but present on sites 
burned 17 years earlier. Differences between burned and unburned densities were 
greatest on severely burned sites. Generally, burned soils had higher soil 
temperatures but lower organic matter and moisture contents than unburned soils.

<p>Hughes [<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#40">40</a>] provides purely descriptive studies of burned and unburned sites within 
the Big Hole grazing allotment in northwestern Arizona. Sites were visited in late 1990s or 
early 2000s. In 1 area, the prefire community was dominated by blackbrush, creosotebush, and 
Joshua tree. 
The area burned in the 1940s, and most of the burned area was dominated by 
unidentified annual species. Hughes [<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#40">40</a>] reported that Joshua tree and other shrubs were returning to 
the burned sites. In 
another area burned  between 1970 and 1980, annuals were dominating burned sites, and 
Joshua tree was conspicuous only on unburned sites [<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#40">40</a>].</p>

FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS:</a>
</span>
<br/>

Joshua tree communities with an abundance of nonnative annual grasses and forbs 
have become more difficult to manage, as they have fostered a fire frequency 
that exceeds the historic fire frequency in Joshua tree habitats (see 
<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/#FIRE ECOLOGY">Fire Ecology</a>). 
Control of these nonnative species may aid in the fire management of Joshua tree 
populations. In the prioritization of nonnative species control, managers may 
want to focus on sites where human-caused fire ignitions have increased.

<p>Removal of fire from Joshua tree habitats, while likely impossible, may also not 
be prudent. As reported above [<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#43">43</a>], postfire sprouting is most common in mid-sized 
Joshua trees, which suggests that recurrent fires and complete removal of fire 
may harm Joshua tree stands.</p>

Several threatened and endangered species that are associated with  Joshua tree woodlands 
in Joshua Tree National Park need to be considered in 
fire management decisions for this area [<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#59">59</a>].

Joshua tree provides important habitat and food for small mammals, birds,  reptiles, 
insects, and spiders. Use by livestock and deer, however, is limited to the 
consumption of accessible blossoms and fruits and utilization of  shade 
[<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#41">41</a>,<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#55">55</a>,<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#106">106</a>].

<p><b><font face="Bell MT" size="4">Small mammals:</font></b> 
Squirrels, woodrats, jackrabbits, kangaroo rats, and mice utilize Joshua tree habitats and/or feed on 
Joshua tree fruits. In a review, McKelvey [<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#72">72</a>] reports that  Mexican 
woodrats have been observed climbing Joshua tree to cut its spiny leaves, which 
they use to protect burrow entrances. Merriam's kangaroo rats and southern 
grasshopper mice are considered "diagnostic" of Joshua tree 
woodlands in the San Gabriel Mountains of California. The Panamint kangaroo rat 
is also common in  Joshua tree woodlands. 
Coyotes are the dominant carnivore [<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#103">103</a>]. Joshua tree has also been recovered from macrofossil 
woodrat middens in the western Mojave 
Desert [<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#70">70</a>] and in Death Valley [<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#110">110</a>].</p>
<p>Antelope  squirrels cache Joshua tree seeds [<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#55">55</a>].  California ground 
squirrels climb Joshua tree 
and consume fruits and seeds, and white-tailed antelope squirrels collect 
over mature dry fruits. The mature fruit coating is cracked and some seeds are 
consumed, while others fall to ground and are dispersed by wind [<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#61">61</a>]. The seedlings 
are a food source for black-tailed jackrabbits in Lanfair Valley, 
California (Griffith, personal communication in [<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#61">61</a>]).</p>
<p>In the Coso area of California's Inyo County, Mohave and 
white-tailed antelope squirrels were observed in June and July feeding on Joshua tree fruits. Of 22 
individually sighted Mohave ground squirrels, 20 were observed harvesting Joshua 
tree seeds. Mohave ground squirrels worked in the tops of Joshua trees nearly 
continuously from 3 hours after sunrise to 1 hour before sunset. One Mohave 
ground squirrel was observed for 4 hours working on clumps of Joshua tree 
fruits. Every 15 to 20 minutes the ground squirrel made trips back to a Joshua 
tree, where the seeds were cached in a burrow near the base of the trunk. Joshua trees 
were apparently a preferred 
Mohave ground squirrel food. There were 16 Mohave 
ground squirrels and 21 white-tailed antelope squirrels observed at Joshua tree fruit 
clusters in an approximately  0.4 km² area on 3 July from 2:45 to 3:30 
p.m. Trees never had more than 1 Mohave ground squirrel, but there were as many 
as 7 white-tailed antelope squirrels in a single tree. Mohave and white-tailed 
antelope squirrels occurred together in Joshua  trees, but aggressive behavior was 
only avoided in large trees with 2 or more widely spaced fruit clusters [<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#118">118</a>].</p>
<p><b><font face="Bell MT" size="4">Birds:</font></b> 
Numerous bird species utilize Joshua tree and Joshua tree habitats in the Mojave Desert. Twenty-five bird 
species use Joshua tree as a nesting tree. Scott's orioles nest in the crown; 
ladder-backed woodpeckers and northern flickers nest in  trunk or 
limb holes. American kestrels and loggerhead shrikes use Joshua tree as a perch when hunting. 
Many bird species feed on Joshua tree blossoms [<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#55">55</a>].</p>
<p>A bird survey in  Joshua Tree National Park concentrated on populations 
occupying habitats with cliffs and those without. Joshua tree occurred only on sites 
without cliffs. Fourteen species were found in noncliff habitats. American 
kestrels, common nighthawks, ash-throated flycatchers, cactus wrens, northern 
mockingbirds, loggerhead shrikes, and orange-crowned warblers were exclusive to noncliff sites [<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#19">19</a>]. 
A bird census of the Great Basin-Mojave desert ecotone found that 
the ecotone provided habitat to 22 resident bird 
species. Thirteen species were encountered along the Mojave Desert transect. 
Ladder-backed woodpeckers were found solely on Joshua tree [<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#107">107</a>].</p>
<p><b><font face="Bell MT" size="4">Herptiles:</font></b>
Joshua tree provides protection and feeding sites for some Mojave Desert lizards. The small desert 
night lizard is often found in Joshua tree bark and clusters of dead leaves [<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#72">72</a>], 
as are desert spiny lizards [<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#89">89</a>]. A night lizard that was not identified to species is 
considered dependent on Joshua tree. Joshua tree bark provides protection and shelter, 
while the night lizard feeds on insects [<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#68">68</a>]. In southwestern Utah, 
Joshua tree is common in desert tortoise habitats, but specific use of Joshua 
tree was not reported [<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#69">69</a>].</p>
<p><b><font face="Bell MT" size="4">Arthropods:</font></b> 
Spiders, scorpions, beetles, 
and white ants utilize dead Joshua tree leaves and fallen branches as homes in the Mojave Desert [<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#72">72</a>]. 
The Navaho yucca borer lays eggs in young Joshua tree stems produced from  rhizomes but 
avoids stems produced from seed [<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#68">68</a>].</p>
<p><font face="Bell MT" size="4"><b>Palatability/nutritional value:</b></font> 
Few studies report on the palatability or nutritional composition of Joshua tree. 
Dittberner and Olson [<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#24">24</a>] rate the palatability of Joshua tree as poor for 
cattle, domestic sheep, horses, pronghorn, elk, mule deer, and small mammals. In Los Angeles County, 
Joshua tree fruits collected in early June had an average sugar content of 11.6%. 
In early July, the average was 14.5%. When Joshua tree fruits are fully ripe 
the sugar content may exceed 20% [<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#61">61</a>].</p>
<p>The composition of Joshua tree leaf blades collected in Yucca Flat, Nevada is 
presented below. Researchers indicated that phosphorus and potassium contents decreased with age, while sodium calcium, 
silicon, iron, boron, aluminum, and titanium increased with age [<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#106">106</a>].</p>

Joshua tree seeds or plants are available commercially [<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#75">75</a>], and 
Joshua tree 
is recommended for use in revegetation projects along Nevada's highways 
[<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#94">94</a>]. Excessive watering of transplanted of Joshua trees may facilitate 
disease in the outer leaves [<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#108">108</a>].

<p>In the eastern part of the Mojave Desert, Joshua  trees between 3 and 8 feet 
(0.9-2 m) tall 
with just a few branches were salvaged from a future gold mine site. Plants were 
grown close together in rows and given 
supplemental water. 
After 2 years, just 9% of the 1,447 trees had died; 36% were in 
excellent health (no yellow leaves), and 56% were in poor health. The study 
indicated that large plants (up to 50 years old) could be salvaged from future mine 
sites for  later revegetation of the disturbed areas [<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#32">32</a>].</p>

Joshua tree may have been an important part of giant ground sloth diets. The analysis 
of giant ground sloth dung found in Nevada's Gyssum Cave revealed that ~80% of 
the fecal material was  Joshua tree [<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#50">50</a>]. Maxwell [<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#68">68</a>] also noted that 
Joshua tree was a regular part of 
the giant ground sloth diet. However, evidence provided by Lenz [<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#61">61</a>] 
suggests that the importance of Joshua tree in giant ground sloth diets has been exaggerated.

<p>Native people of the Mojave Desert used Joshua tree for food and in  
construction. Cahuilla people of southern California used Joshua tree fibers to 
make sandals and nets and consumed Joshua tree blossoms [<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#8">8</a>]. Red Joshua tree rootlets were utilized as a dye for 
baskets and blankets [<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#2">2</a>,<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#55">55</a>], and sweet Joshua tree flowers were 
roasted and eaten by Native people [<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#55">55</a>]. Joshua tree seeds were eaten raw or 
ground into a mash and cooked by southern California Natives [<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#79">79</a>]. In a review, 
Webber [<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#108">108</a>] reports that Joshua tree beams and timber 
have been found in ancient cliff dwellings.</p>

OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS:</a>

<br/>
<b><font face="Bell MT" size="4">Biomass estimations:</font></b>
Researchers developed a method for estimating the biomass of Joshua tree in an entire watershed. 
Estimations are based on Joshua tree size classes and their corresponding mean weights [<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#10">10</a>].

<p><b><font face="Bell MT" size="4">Climate change:</font></b> 
Numerous studies have investigated the potential changes in Joshua tree growth and 
distribution based on climate change and elevated CO<sub>2</sub> levels. 
Huxman and others [<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#45">45</a>] conducted experiments on Joshua tree growth and photosynthetic 
capabilities under elevated CO<sub>2</sub> levels and increased temperatures. 
Dole and others [<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#25">25</a>] modeled  changes in 
Joshua tree's distribution based on climate change and increased CO<sub>2</sub>
levels. Based on work by Loik and others [<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#63">63</a>], the lethal low temperature 
tolerance for Joshua tree seedlings is lowered by 2.9 °F (1.6 °C) under doubled CO<sub>2</sub>
concentrations. The model predicted that a considerable portion of Joshua tree's 
current range would become unsuitable, but that some new habitat would be made 
suitable. However, occupation of new habitats would depend on successful 
recruitment and availability of the new habitats. For 
maps of the future  distribution of Joshua tree with climate change, increased CO<sub>2</sub> 
levels, and/or altered freezing tolerance, see [<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/tree/yucbre/all.html#25">25</a>].
