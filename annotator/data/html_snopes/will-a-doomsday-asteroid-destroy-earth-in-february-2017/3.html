The <strong>NEOWISE 2019 Data Release</strong> makes available 
the 3.4 and 4.6 μm (W1 and W2) Single-exposure images and extracted source 
information that were acquired between December 13, 2017 and December 13, 2018 
UTC, the fifth year of survey operations of the 
<a href="http://neowise.ipac.caltech.edu" target="blank">Near-Earth Object 
Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer Reactivation Mission</a> 
(NEOWISE; 
<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/2014ApJ...792...30M/" target="blank">Mainzer et al. 2014, ApJ, 792, 30</a>).  
The fifth year NEOWISE data products are concatenated with those
from the first four years (originally released on 
<a href="neowise_2015_release_intro.html" target="blank">March 26, 2015</a>, 
<a href="neowise_2016_release_intro.html" target="blank">March 23, 2016</a>, 
<a href="neowise_2017_release_intro.html" target="blank">June 1, 2017</a> and 
<a href="neowise_2018_release_intro.html" target="blank">April 19, 2018</a>) 
into a single archive so that all data can be queried easily at one time.
</p>
<p>NEOWISE scanned the sky nearly ten complete times during the 
first five years of survey operations, with six months separating survey
passes. Twelve or more independent exposures are made on each 
point on the sky during each survey epoch. Therefore, the NEOWISE archive 
is a time-domain resource for extracting multiple thermal flux and 
position measurements of solar system small bodies, as well as background
stars and galaxies.  
</p>
<p>
The combined <strong>NEOWISE Data Release</strong> products from the 
first five years of survey operations include:
</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Single-exposure Images - 12,808,696</strong> calibrated 
1016x1016 pix @2.75"/pix FITS image sets for the individual 7.7 sec W1 and W2 
NEOWISE survey exposures. Each image set consists of two intensity images, 
noise maps, and bit-masks indicating pixel use status, one each for the W1
and W2 bands. </li>
<br/>
<li><strong>Single-exposure Source Database</strong> -  
Time-tagged fluxes, positions and measurement information for 
<strong>95,684,850,296</strong> source detections extracted from the 
Single-exposure images.</li>
<br/>
<li><strong>Moving Object Tracklets</strong> - Sets of linked 
NEOWISE position-time pair measurements of solar system objects that 
have been confirmed by the 
<a href="http://www.minorplanetcenter.net/" target="blank">IAU Minor Planet 
Center</a>.  NEOWISE acquired over <strong>760,000</strong>
confirmed infrared detections of <strong>32,991</strong> 
different objects during the first five years of the survey 
(<a href="#figure1">Figure 1</a>).</li>
<br/>
<li><strong>Known Solar System Object Possible Association List</strong> - 
Database 
of asteroids, comets, planets and planetary satellites, known at the time 
of data processing, that are predicted to be in the field-of-view of 
individual NEOWISE Single-exposure images.  This is not a vetted list of 
solar system object detections. Refer to the NEOWISE Moving Object Tracklets 
for confirmed solar system object detections. 
</li>
</ul>

<p>NEOWISE utilizes the Wide-Field Infrared Explorer (WISE; 
<a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/2010AJ....140.1868W/" target="blank">Wright et al. 2010, AJ, 140, 1868</a>) 
spacecraft that surveyed the entire sky in 2010 with a cryogenically cooled 
40 cm telescope and four 1kx1k mid-infrared array detectors operating at
3.4, 4.6, 12 and 22 μm.  WISE continued to survey for four months following 
the exhaustion of its solid hydrogen cryogen in September 2010 using its two 
short wavelength bands. 
After completing a survey of the inner main asteroid belt and a second
coverage of the sky, WISE was placed into hibernation in February 
2011.</p>
<p>The WISE spacecraft was brought out of hibernation in September 2013 
and renamed NEOWISE with a mission to detect and characterize 
asteroids and comets, and to learn more about the population of near-Earth 
objects that could pose an impact hazard to the Earth.  The spacecraft was
returned to zenith pointing which enabled the telescope and focal plane 
to passively cool down to approximately 73 K. Survey operations were 
resumed on December 13, 2013 UTC with the W1 and W2 detectors operating 
at sensitivities near those of the original cryogenic survey.  The first
<strong>solar system moving object tracklet</strong> candidates were
reported to the 
<a href="http://minorplanetcenter.net" target="blank">IAU Minor Planet 
Center</a> on December 26, and tracklet deliveries continue to 
be made three times per week.  NEOWISE continues to survey the sky,
and as of mid-April 2019 has acquired over 800,000 
infrared detections of approximately 34,000 
different solar system objects.
