<p>
<b><u>The FIVE POINTED Sirius Star IS A RELIGIOUS SYMBOL.</u> SIRIUS was astronomically <u>THE FOUNDATION OF THE ENTIRE RELIGIOUS SYSTEM OF EGYPT.</u></b>  (See footnote 1)
 <br/><br/>
<b><u>THE SIRIUS STAR</u></b> is the star of THE GODDESS ISIS OF ANCIENT EGYPT, who was the prostitute Queen of Heaven mentioned in (Jeremiah 44:15-25) and one of the pagan gods of the Baal religion mentioned in (I Kings 22:53).   
 <br/><br/>
<b><u>THE SIRIUS STAR</u> was granted GOD/GODDESS STATUS</b> among the Egyptians and the Sumerians.  Sumeria is also known as Assyria, Babylon and now modern Iraq.  
 <br/><br/>
Acts 7:39-43…Referring to the Israelites…"To whom our fathers would not obey, but thrust him (Moses) from them, and in their hearts <u><b>TURNED BACK AGAIN INTO EGYPT</b></u>, Saying unto Aaron, Make us gods to go before us: for as for this Moses, which brought us out of the land of Egypt, we wot not ( don't know) what is become of him. And they made a calf in those days, and offered sacrifice unto the idol, and rejoiced in the works of their own hands. Then God turned, and gave them up to worship the host of heaven; as it is written in the book of the prophets, O ye house of Israel, have ye offered to me slain beasts and sacrifices by the space of forty years in the wilderness? Yea, ye took up the tabernacle of Moloch, and <u><b>THE STAR OF YOUR GOD</b></u> REMPHAN <b>(the Sirius star)</b>, <b><u>FIGURES</u></b> (the Five Pointed Star and other figures) which ye made <u><b>TO WORSHIP THEM</b></u>: and I will carry you away beyond Babylon."
 <br/><br/>
<b><u>SATANISM</u>:  THE SYMBOL OF WICCA WITCHCRAFT AND SATANISM</b> is the <b><u>PENTAGRAM</u></b>, the five pointed Sirius Star in a circle.
 <br/><br/>
<b>BAAL WORSHIP</b>, found in the Old Testament, was practiced in Egypt.  <b>BAAL</b> comes from the word <b><u>BAAL</u>ZEBUB or BELZEBUB who is <u>SATAN</u>.  BAAL WAS LITERALLY SATAN WORSHIP.</b>  II Kings 1:2
Matthew 12:24 But when the Pharisees heard it, they said, This fellow doth not cast out devils, but by <u><b>BEELZEBUB, THE PRINCE OF THE DEVILS.</b></u> (SATAN)
 <br/><br/>
<u><b>SATAN IS THE GOD OF THIS WORLD.</b></u>  2 Corinthians 4:4.
 <br/><br/>
<u><b>WITCHCRAFT AND SATANISM IS SPREADING RAPIDLY TODAY.</b></u>  The Bible forbids witchcraft, Galations 5:20, but is being promoted in major book stores and films.  The spirit behind witchcraft is Satan.</p>
</font><center><b>SATAN WORSHIP</b></center>
<br/>
<p><b>THE BEAST ( Revelation 13:4), who is the Antichrist, <u>WILL DEMAND THAT THE WHOLE WORLD WORSHIP SATAN.</u></b> <br/>
Revelation 13:4… And <b><u>they WORSHIPPED THE DRAGON .(Satan)</u></b> 
Revelation 20:2… And he laid hold on <b><u>THE DRAGON</u></b>, that old serpent, <b><u>WHICH IS THE DEVIL, AND SATAN, </u>
<br/><br/>
ACCORDING TO THE BIBLE, THE ANTICHRIST WILL ARISE IN A DOCILE MANNER IN THE NAME OF WORLD PEACE</b>
<br/><br/>
Daniel 8:25 "And through his <b>policy (laws)</b>, also he <b>shall cause craft</b> (deceitfulness and corruption) to prosper in his hand; and he shall magnify himself in his heart, and <b><u>BY PEACE SHALL DESTROY MANY</u></b>: he shall also stand up against the Prince of princes (Jesus, Isaiah. 9:6); but he shall be broken without hand." (Revelation 19:15).  The Antichrist ultimately will lose against Jesus Christ.<br/>
Revelation 12:9 And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, which <b>DECEIVETH THE WHOLE WORLD:</b> </p>
<center><b>THE National Football League 2007 SUPERBOWL</b></center>
<br/>
<p>An interesting thing happened during the American Super Bowl which determines the NFL Football Champion, February, 2007.  The half-time entertainer had a big cloth of some kind around the stage on which he was performing. There was an appendage hanging down from his guitar.  This created a silhouette that <b>LOOKED LIKE SATAN</b> with a forked tail, and below him showed the silhouettes of people with their hands lifted as if they were <b>WORSHIPPING SATAN</b>.  The secular news media was even talking about this.  No one should be naïve enough to believe that this was merely coincidental.  The world is being conditioned to fulfill Revelation 13:4, to boldly and openly worship Satan.  The Bible prophesies this is coming.  These are some of the signs of the times. (Matthew 16:3)
 <br/><br/>
<b>WHO IS USING THE FIVE POINTED SIRIUS STAR?
 <br/><br/>
<u>MILITARY VEHICLES.</u></b>  The five pointed Sirius Star is prominent over military planes and land vehicles all over the world. During World War II Japanese military officers wore this symbol.  The Japanese worship the sun god just as the Egyptians did. (II Kings 23:5) The symbol on their flag is the sun, a symbol of Baal.  
 <br/><br/>
THERE  is also <b>the <u>RED SIRIUS STAR</u></b> in EGYPTOLOGY.
 <br/><br/>
The <b>RED FIVE POINTED STAR</b> is also seen on <b><u>RUSSIAN AND CHINESE FIGHTER JETS AND BOMBERS.</u></b>
<br/><br/>
<b><u>NATIONAL FLAGS:</u></b> The five pointed Sirius star is the symbol on flags of many nations including the U.S.A., Iraq, North Korea, China, and the European Union, just to mention a few.( search the history of the flags.)

<b><u>THE MASONS.</u></b>  The five pointed Sirius Star is a prominent symbol among the Freemasons, and not without significance.  All of the Masonic symbols have secret meanings.  The Masons are steeped in Egyptian symbols and Egyptology. The early Freemasons influence is the reason the five pointed Sirius Star is on the American flag. Our nation's capital, Washington D.C., was laid out in alignment with the Zodiac just like the pyramids of Egypt, in accordance with that astrological religion. (See footnote 2)  The Freemasons know exactly what this five pointed Sirius Star stands for.  
 <br/><br/>
<b><u>AMERICA'S FIVE POINTED SIRIUS STAR, WHICH IS A RELIGIOUS SYMBOL,  IS ONE OF IT'S MAJOR SYMBOLS</u></b>.  Yet, in the name of separation of church and state, it is illegal in America to put up any Judeo-Christian symbols such as the nativity scene and the Ten Commandments on public property.  Is this not religious discrimination?  
 <br/><br/>
<b><u>THE NEW FREEWAY SYSTEM:</u></b> The emblem of the five pointed Sirius Star is being imbedded as an insignia on the freeway systems in parts of Texas. Texans have just thought that this five pointed star was the Texas Star, not realizing its origin and religious meaning! I don't know about other states, but it would be interesting to hear if it is a national trend.
 <br/><br/>
<b><u>SIRIUS SATTELITE RADIO:</u></b>  International satellite radio has been introduced to us as Sirius Radio.  Its symbol is a dog with a five pointed star on its eye, representing the Dogstar   The Egyptians called Sirius the "Dogstar". 
 <br/><br/>
<u><b>ISLAM:</b></u> The Egyptian Sirius Star is a major symbol in THE LOGO OF ISLAM. Notice the Crescent Moon with the five pointed Sirius star just above the middle of it.   The Sirius star is prominent over the cresent moon on Islamic mosques all over the world.<br/>
   a. Islam's Quran calls Sirius An-najm-the Star<br/>
   b. Yusafali:  That He is the Lord of Sirius (the mighty Star)<br/>
   c. Pikthal:  and that His is the Lord of Sirius<br/>
Shakir:  and that He is the Lord of Sirius

<u><b>An AMERICAN LEGION NEWSLETTER out of the state of Louisiana (USA)</b></u> is called <u><b>THE KORAN STAR</b></u>.  Why would an American institution, honoring its war veterans, name its newsletter after Islam's holy book the Quran and after Islam's Sirius Star? The member who showed it to us had no answer. He also was mystified.
 <br/><br/>
<u><b>PRE-SCHOOL CHILDREN ARE TAUGHT TO DRAW</b></u>  the five Pointed Star as one of their first drawing exercises.
 <br/><br/>
<u><b>MANY BUSINESSES</b></u> are using THE FIVE POINTED SYRIUS STAR as a logo on their buildings.
 <br/><br/>
<u><b>MACY'S DEPARTMENT STORE</b></u> , displays a big RED FIVE POINTED SIRIUS STAR in it's advertising and on shopping bags. (business/ buying and selling).
 <br/><br/>
<u><b>WALMART.</b></u>  In the year 2000, the squiggly between Wal and Mart, (Wal-Mart), was replaced by the five pointed Sirius Star in it's trademark. Wal(star)Mart (an American retail store) has become the largest retail store in the world.<br/>
<b>The Sirius Star</b> is now positioned at <u><b>SELF CHECK OUT STANDS</b></u> where buying and selling is done. Revelation 13:16-18.  You do not have to have an attendant to help you check out.  You can insert a credit or debit card; or use cash and leave without anyone attending you.  The technology is now in place for a cashless society. The Bible predicts that all one will have to do to <b>BUY AND SELL</b> is to have the Mark in your RIGHT HAND or FOREHEAD.  Revelation 13:16-18).  The Verichip is a natural for this.  This Mark, or chip, in your hand or forehead could easily be scanned to deduct the money out of your banking account.  The BINARY BAR CODE on products already have the number six, six, six in the middle of the code. It would be a natural for six, six, six to be part of the binary code in a Veri-chip implanted in one's hand or forehead since it is already being used for commerce.  The chip is too small for you to see what information it has in it, but is being marketed now for medical chips to hold your history. (See the related article on our website about The Veri-Chip and The Mark of the Beast).
 <br/><br/>
<b>WE ARE SEEING A BAAL RENAISSANCE OF ANCIENT EGYPTIAN SYMBOLS</b> and ideology in the world today.  This humanistic, New Age movement is totally antichrist and rooted in religious Egyptology.
 <br/><br/>
<b>THE FIVE POINTED SIRIUS STAR WOULD BE A NATURAL LOGO OR MARK</b> to use that everyone in the world would accept for doing business, without controversy or question.  I believe the five pointed Sirius Star <u>could be</u> the symbol or the logo of the global world (system) government that the Bible prophesies is coming.  
 <br/><br/>
<b>MOST CHRISTIANS HAVEN'T A CLUE WHAT THE FIVE POINTED SIRIUS STAR REPRESENTS.</b>  I urge you to look up Sirius on under (google) and research for yourself. According to the Word of God, <b>The MARK OF THE BEAST</b> will be one of three things, or a combination of them: 
 <br/><br/>
Revelation 13:17 And that NO MAN MIGHT BUY OR SELL, <u>save he that had</u> <b><u>THE MARK</u>, OR <u>THE NAME</u> OF THE BEAST, OR <u>THE NUMBER</u> OF HIS NAME.</b><br/>
Revelation 13:18 <u>Here is wisdom</u>. Let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast: for it is the number of a man; and his number is Six hundred threescore and six (666).
 <br/><br/>
<b>MANY THINK THE MARK OF THE BEAST IS JUST the number 666, BUT  IT IS <u>NOT</u>!</b>   IT CAN be the Mark (or logo of the Antichrist) alone; the Name of the Beast (Antichrist); or the number 666, or any <u>combination</u> of the three.  
 <br/><br/>
According to the Bible, <b>ONE MUST HAVE THE MARK implanted in the right hand or forehead</b>,( <u>His Name, or His number, 666</u>), <b>TO DO <u>BUSINESS</u>.</b>  The Verichip, Mondex Chip, and Medichip are being introduced and implemented in various sectors of society NOW. It would be easy to imbed the Mark, Name or the number 666 in the chip.  The chip is so small you would never know what is inside it. The Bible gives us a key to understanding why the mark or chip will be put in the right hand or forehead. Research now shows that this is the best place for the chip to be placed in order to replenish it's solar power source.
 <br/><br/>
Choosing to take this chip may be <b>OPTIONAL AT FIRST for an I.D. in doing business</b>.  But the time will come, according to scripture, that it will <b>NOT BE OPTIONAL</b>.   It will be <b>UNIVERSALLY MANDATED, WITHOUT EXCEPTION</b>, for <u>everyone on earth</u>.  This is where the global economy is headed.  <b>You will not be able to do business without it.</b> </p>
<center><b>THE CONSEQUENCES (from the anti-christ) FOR NOT TAKING THE MARK</b></center>
<br/>
<p>The Bible says it will be the death penalty, <b>BEHEADING</b>, for anyone who will not take this mark. It is interesting that Islam's favorite means of dealing with infidels is beheading.  Revelation 20:4 And <b>I saw</b> thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was given unto them: and I saw the souls of them that were <b><u>BEHEADED</u> FOR THE WITNESS OF JESUS</b>, AND FOR THE <b>WORD OF GOD</b>, AND WHICH <u>HAD NOT</u> <b>WORSHIPPED THE BEAST, NEITHER HIS IMAGE, NEITHER HAD RECEIVED HIS MARK UPON THEIR FOREHEADS, OR IN THEIR HANDS</b>; and they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years. (KJV)</p>
<center><b>THE CONSEQUENCES (From GOD) IF YOU TAKE THE MARK</b></center>
<br/>
<p>We must know what the Bible says about taking the Mark. <br/>
Revelation 16:2… And the first went, and poured out his vial upon the earth; and there fell a noisome and grievous sore upon the men which had the MARK OF THE BEAST, and upon them which worshipped his image. 
 <br/><br/>
Revelation 19:20… And the beast was taken, and with him the false prophet that wrought miracles before him, with which he deceived them that had received the MARK OF THE BEAST, and them that worshipped his image. THESE BOTH WERE CAST ALIVE INTO A LAKE OF FIRE BURNING WITH BRIMSTONE. 
 <br/><br/>
Hosea 4:6 …"My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge:" <br/>
Proverbs 14:12 …There is a way which seemeth right unto a man, but the end .
 <br/><br/>
<b>THE GLOBAL MOVEMENT OBJECTIVE IS TO STAMP CHRIST'S NAME AND THE BIBLE FROM OFF THE FACE OF THE EARTH FOREVER.</b>  Those behind this movement may have good intentions, but they have been deceived into believing that Christ is the pariah of the world because he dare's to say that he is the way, the truth and the life and that NO MAN COMES TO THE FATHER GOD BUT BY HIM. John 14:6. The New World Order believes that ridding the world of Him is the only way to bring about World Peace.  They want all gods to be on an equal plane, although they really don't believe in God.  The spirit of antichrist is getting stronger and bolder every day.
 <br/><br/>
<b>I PROPOSE TO YOU THAT THERE IS A STRONG POSSIBILITY THAT THE <u>FIVE POINTED SIRIUS STAR</u> <u>MAY BE THE MARK</u> (THE LOGO) OF THE BEAST.</b>
<br/><br/>
II Thessalonians 2:11-12 "And for this cause God shall send them strong delusion, that <b>THEY SHOULD BELIEVE A LIE: THAT THEY ALL MIGHT BE DAMNED who believed not the truth,</b>"
