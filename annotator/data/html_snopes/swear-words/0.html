<p>[OPENING CREDITS]<br/>
  [applause] [cheers] [standing ovation]</p>
<p>BILL MAHER: Thank you very much. How are you? Thank you. [blows kiss] Aw, please. Thank you very much. Well, I know – I know how it is. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Oh, please, wow, what a – you’re in a terrific mood. I don’t know why. The Pope is clinging to life. Terri Schiavo has died. Who’s ready for some comedy?! [applause] [cheers]</p>
<p>It’s a sad day, but we can do this. You know, we have done this before. Back on ABC, we did a show right after 9/11. All right, bad example. [laughter] No, I tell you, between the praying that people are doing for the Pope and the praying for Terri Schiavo, the switchboard is backed up. Christians are furious. They realize a lot of people are just talking to some guy in Bombay. [laughter] [applause]</p>
<p>Well, no, I tell you, that poor woman has passed away now, and they are still fighting about it. The husband wants her cremated; the parents want her buried; and President Bush wants to appoint her to the Supreme Court. [laughter] [applause] So it doesn’t end. </p>
<p>I tell you, as if we didn’t have enough death this week, Frank Perdue passed – you know Frank? The titan of the chicken industry, the filthy, dirty chicken industry—[laughter]—we’ve all eaten Frank’s chicken, come on. But Frank passed away and the family finally made the decision to remove his feeding bucket. [laughter] [applause] Oh, you’ll get over it. It’s okay. You’ll have chicken again. [laughter]</p>
<p>Well, among the bad news, listen to this, one in four returning Iraqi veterans, it came out this week, who are at Veteran Affairs Hospital, has been diagnosed with a mental disorder. One out of four. I know that sounds high, but it does include everybody who says, “Am I crazy, or were we sent there under false pretenses?” [laughter] [applause]</p>
<p>Well, apparently they were, because still another intelligence report came out this week. I have report fatigue, I tell you, but this was apparently the President’s Report, came out and said the U.S. intelligence community still screwed, tattooed and blued. Everything they said about Iraq, they said, “Dead wrong, still woefully inept about our enemies that are still ahead of us.” Apparently there is a very fine line between the intelligence community and intelligence community college. [laughter] [applause] These guys, not only can’t they find Osama bin Laden, but they just fired the only guy who knew how to TiVO Al-Jazeera. [laughter] Now, they say this time there will be repercussions. The officers who told Bush the lies he wanted to hear—[laughter]—will either be fired, suspended or transferred to work on Social Security. [laughter] So…[applause] Oh, I kid the President. He knows that. I kid him. [laughter]</p>
<p>Hey, I’ve got to give it up to his wife. Laura went to Afghanistan this week. That is not a safe place. That’s a gutsy trip to make for a lady. And she went there to talk to women. She told the women of Afghanistan – give them a little hope – she said, “Not only are women here in America allowed to drive—[laughter]—but often we have to, because the husband is shitface.” [laughter] [applause] Kid the President!</p>
<p>And speaking of our wars, listen to this: anti-war protestors have now showed up at the Michael Jackson trial because they realize, hey, cameras, free publicity. So they get on camera. One embarrassing moment: a protestor had a sign the other day that said, “Bring Our Boys Home.” [laughter] Ah, you’re ahead of me! [applause] All right, thank you very much for writing the end to your own jokes. We’ve got a great show. Whoopi Goldberg is here; Alec Baldwin is here; Dr. Cornel West is here, and a little later I’ll be speaking with the Reverend Jesse Jackson. [applause] </p>
<p>But first, he hosts “The O’Reilly Factor” on the Fox News Network weeknights at 8:00 p.m., the 800-pound gorilla of news ratings, Mr. Bill O’Reilly, ladies and gentlemen! [applause] Bill?</p>
<p>BILL O’REILLY [via satellite]: Hey, Bill, how are you? The audio feed is cutting in and out of here, but let’s give it a shot.</p>
<p>MAHER: Oh, well, that gives you a good excuse if I ask you a question you don’t like.</p>
<p>O’REILLY: And I can’t answer it. “What?” “Huh?” [laughter]</p>
<p>MAHER: Well, listen, I appreciate you doing this. I know this must be a sad day for you, with the Pope in the state he’s in. You’re a Catholic. We will never agree on religion, but let’s get to what we might agree on with this Pope, because I don’t agree with him about a lot of stuff, but I always liked him because, one, he was consistent; he was not a hypocrite like the congressional Republicans who took advantage of this Schiavo affair—[applause]—and, two, whenever – okay – whenever people –[to O’Reilly]—your eyebrows went up. [laughter]</p>
<p>O’REILLY: Doesn’t sound like a GOP crowd you’ve got there, Maher, you know. [laughter]</p>
<p>MAHER: Yeah, no, we’ve got a few.</p>
<p>O’REILLY: You bussing them in from Tulsa or what? [laughter]</p>
<p>MAHER: We’re trying. Long Island, Bill. [laughter]</p>
<p>O’REILLY: There you go.</p>
<p>MAHER: Now, whenever people would say to me, “You know, Ronald Reagan won the Cold War,” I would say, “Not so fast. You know who really won the Cold War? The Pope. He started it with Poland.” Okay, Polish Pope went to Poland, that’s where that brushfire began. [applause] Would you agree with me that the Pope had a lot more to do with winning the Cold War than Ronald Reagan?</p>
<p>O’REILLY: No, I wouldn’t say a lot more to do with it. I think the Pope was an influence of sanity in a sea of insanity. First, the Nazis took over Poland, and then Stalin runs the Nazis out and takes over. And the Pope, a young priest at that time, witnesses barbarities against the Jews and his own people constantly for 35 years. And in his own quiet way, methodical way, he made it clear as Bishop of Krakow, that barbarity and the godless communists who were doing the terrible things to the Poles had to go. And therefore, he gave authority and legitimacy to Lec Walesa and his crew. So he had a lot to do with it. But in the end, the United States bankrupted the Soviet Union and that’s why it fell.</p>
<p>MAHER: So Reagan still the hero even beyond the Pope. I…okay. [applause]</p>
<p>O’REILLY: No, I’m not making a comparison. I’m just giving you an accurate sense of history.</p>
<p>MAHER: All right.</p>
<p>O’REILLY: That’s what we do here on HBO. [laughter] [applause]</p>
<p>MAHER: Right, like they’re going to hire you. [laughter] [applause] [cheers]</p>
<p>O’REILLY: I didn’t – you know, I didn’t hear that. [laughter] When does “Taxicab Confessions” come on? [laughter]</p>
<p>MAHER: I said you’ll do a show here when the Fox Network hires me. [laughter]</p>
<p>O’REILLY: Ah. </p>
<p>MAHER: But, okay, another thing, the Pope, I liked about him, was that he wasn’t afraid to make an apology. This is the Pope who came out during his term and said, “You know what? The Holocaust, we could have been a lot better to the Jews. Sorry about that, fellows.” Galileo. He said, “You know what? Okay, it’s 500 years late, but, you’re right, the earth does revolve around the sun. We got that one wrong.” [laughter]</p>
<p>Child abuse. You know, he did a thing on that. So, for a guy who was infallible, he owned up an awful lot to stuff that wasn’t right before him. Okay, so when do you think we’ll see the Church reversing themselves on women being priests?</p>
<p>O’REILLY: We’ll see that pretty much the time you’re baptized in the Catholic Church. [laughter] [applause]</p>
<p>MAHER: Bill, I have already been baptized in the Catholic Church. [voices overlap]</p>
<p>O’REILLY: Well, you’ll be born again then. [laughter] Look, each pope who takes over brings his own sensibilities to the papacy. And the good thing about John Paul II, who will be a saint, by the way; I do believe he will be canonized – is that he walked the walk. The man sincerely believed in human life and sincerely believed in helping the poor. He sincerely believed that all life was sacred. And his message was consistent throughout his papacy, almost three decades.</p>
<p>Now, I disagree with the Pope on some things. I’m sure you disagree with him on everything. But you’ve got to admire his sincerity and admire the fact that he did an awful lot of good for millions of people all over the world.</p>
<p>MAHER: What do you disagree with the Pope on?</p>
<p>O’REILLY: I disagreed with the Pope; I thought he should have been much more pro-active in the child abuse scandal here in the United States. That he should have sacked Bishop – Cardinal Law and Mahoney quickly. [applause] </p>
<p>I believe that if the Pope wants to come out and say, “Listen, you don’t fight a war unless you absolutely have to,” then if the Holy See is going to do that, it has to define the war on terror as they see it. All right, we don’t go to war; we don’t be pro-active in war; then how do we defeat the terrorists? You can’t just criticize, in my opinion – remember, the Holy See is a separate nation. It’s actually a country with a Secretary of State and a foreign policy. All right, if you’re going to criticize the United States for how it’s waging the war on terror, what would you do? And you didn’t hear that from the Vatican. So those are two areas. </p>
<p>MAHER: That’s what I don’t get about you religious people. It seems like if you’re religious, you’ve got to swallow the whole wafer. [laughter] That you can’t just say – you know what? He’s not a president. He’s the Pope. I mean, that’s why I don’t have a religion. Because I don’t want to be able – I don’t want to have to say that, okay, I agree with everything a guy says. And it seems like if you’re a Catholic, you can’t just pick and choose.</p>
<p>O’REILLY: That’s not true. I mean, the only things that Catholics are required to believe are dogma. For example, there are certain tenets of the faith. But look at meat on Friday. I remember being in grammar school when the nuns said, “If you eat that burger, O’Reilly, on Friday, you’re going to hell!” And that was the rule. Remember that rule, no meat on Friday?</p>
<p>MAHER: Well, you are still going to hell. [laughter]</p>
<p>O’REILLY: I know, but…[applause]</p>
<p>MAHER: Anyway, no, I’m kidding. [laughs]</p>
<p>O’REILLY: Well, we ought to tell everybody what’s going on, Maher. We ought to tell everybody that you and I just bought a condo down there together! [laughter] Come on. You’re not going to be lonely in hell. You’ll have plenty of buddies down there. [laughter]</p>
<p>MAHER: All right, but stay out of my side of the refrigerator. [laughter]</p>
<p>O’REILLY: Anyway, what? But the meat on Friday thing changed, okay?</p>
<p>MAHER: Let me – but – all right—</p>
<p>O’REILLY: So that was a man-made law, not the dogma law. I’m sorry to bother you. Let’s get back to hell. [laughter]</p>
<p>MAHER: [laughs] No, no. Let me ask you a question about the Schiavo thing that we just saw over the last two weeks. Now you’re a guy who says you play it down the middle, and if you’re not a conservative, you certainly are a hero to the conservatives. I can’t think of anything less conservative than Congress writing and the president signing a law for one person. Okay, I’ve never – I’ve never seen this in the history of the United States. [applause]</p>
<p>The Federal Appeals Court in Atlanta scolded them the other day for acting in a manner they said, “demonstrably at odds with our founding fathers’ blueprint.” There are laws named after one person, like the Miranda laws, but they don’t just apply to Mr. Miranda. They apply to everyone. Not so with the Schiavo Law. Does George Bush remember that he put his hand on the Bible to uphold the Constitution and not the other way around? [applause] [cheers]</p>
<p>O’REILLY: Is there a question? [laughter]</p>
<p>MAHER: Yes. I’m asking you about “rule of law.” You know, when Clinton was getting his blowjob, it was all about “rule of law.” [laughter]</p>
<p>O’REILLY: Look, look, I mean, I thought the whole thing was a circus, you know. And what I saw was a bunch of people demagoguing it from both sides. I mean, I wanted to instill feeding tubes into half the pundits and politicians in the country to shut them up. [laughter] I had no problem with Judge Grier’s decision in Florida.</p>
<p>MAHER: But you can’t deny that this is a tremendous abrogation of any principles, especially conservative principles, when you write a law for one family.</p>
<p>O’REILLY: That’s right.</p>
<p>MAHER: Even Justice Scalia wouldn’t sign on to that. If Scalia doesn’t go along with it, ooh, that seems pretty right. [laughter] [applause]</p>
<p>O’REILLY: All right, what I think would – look, they were all demagoguing the issue, all of them. So if you want to pick sides, go right ahead. The reason Congress did what it did and the President signed it, was they wanted to have some kind of oversight in this – in the possibility that there were some kind of shenanigans in the State of Florida. </p>
<p>You can almost compare it – it’s not a valid comparison, but let me just—[laughter]—let me just make a point. It’s almost like they wrote specific laws to get James Meredith into the University of Mississippi. They did things to override the state courts in the ‘50s and ‘60s because the state courts were out of control, and they were violating the spirit of the country. </p>
<p>So anyway, Congress came together and they said, “Look, let’s have a little oversight here just in case something happened. A woman’s going to die. Want to make sure.” They ran and they did it. The Democrats ran for the hills, with the exception of Barney Frank. They didn’t show up. They didn’t try to block it because it was basically everybody knew – everybody who was following the case – there wasn’t going to be any overturning, that all they were going to do was take a last look before the woman died. </p>
<p>I didn’t have any problem with it. I don’t see the end of the Constitution. I don’t see the country collapsing over this thing. I see a bunch of people who demagogued it, and I didn’t like that. But now it’s over and I hope the woman is resting in peace.</p>
<p>MAHER: All right, Bill, you’re a stand-up guy to do this. I know this was not an easy day for you to come by and help me out.</p>
<p>O’REILLY: No, any time, Bill. I appreciate it. </p>
<p>MAHER: Yeah, all right, thank you.</p>
<p>O’REILLY: You helped us when we were very early on.</p>
<p>MAHER: By the way, Sean Hannity, whose show I have done a million times, won’t do my show.</p>
<p>O’REILLY: He won’t?</p>
<p>MAHER: So, you know. </p>
<p>O’REILLY: Well, he’ll be in hell with you and me, so…[laughter]</p>
<p>MAHER: I was going to say. Bill O’Reilly, thank you very much. [applause] All right, let’s meet our panel. </p>
<p>All right, here is our panel. He is a Princeton University professor of religion whose latest book is Democracy Matters, Dr. Cornel West right over here. [applause] [cheers]</p>
<p>He is a producer and one of my favorite actors, both on Broadway and in the movies where he received an Oscar nomination for “The Cooler,” and he’s very funny, by the way: Alec Baldwin right over here. [applause] [cheers]</p>
<p>And she is the Oscar-winning actress whose latest HBO special, “Whoopi Back on Broadway, the 20th Anniversary,” debuts April 9th. Whoopi Goldberg right over here! [applause] [cheers] Whoopi.</p>
<p>So, for the conservatives were like, “Oh, last time we watched, boy, we had a half-conservative audience; what happened? Look at this panel.” Hey, you guys were all in town on this day. You were all too good to resist. So I’m not trying to fuck with the conservatives. [laughter] So I heard you guffawing back there as Bill O’Reilly was talking.</p>
<p>WHOOPI GOLDBERG: Yeah, I just – well, yeah—</p>
<p>MAHER: What?</p>
<p>GOLDBERG: You know, it was – you know, when you watch his show and you listen to him separately from that, he makes sense occasionally, but your response about the blowjob really sort of got me because it was true.</p>
<p>MAHER: Right.</p>
<p>GOLDBERG: You know—</p>
<p>MAHER: Rule of law, remember that? It wasn’t about the sex. </p>
<p>GOLDBERG: [overlapping] Yes, I do. Yes.</p>
<p>MAHER: [overlapping] It was about rule of law, the letter of the law. [laughs]</p>
<p>GOLDBERG: So that made me laugh. I don’t think he heard it, but I sure did. [laughter]</p>
<p>MAHER: Do you think we are entering an era where really it is coming down to religious battles about everything? It seems like the Republican Party is the party of the Bible, and therefore the Democratic Party has to be the party of the Constitution. [applause] But the Democratic Party really isn’t standing up for their half of this battle. I don’t feel like anybody is speaking out for secular America. You know, the one the founding fathers wanted? [applause]</p>
<p>CORNEL WEST: Absolutely, absolutely.</p>
<p>ALEC BALDWIN: I think that people – I think that people assume that elected officials are going to that, that there was a separation between church and state and that all of the billions and trillions of dollars we spend on government was going to go toward secular enterprises. But I think the one thing – because I want to ask –[to West]—have you speak about this, but I thought one thing that was interesting was that O’Reilly didn’t mention that they always diminish their actions once they misstep. So when he says, “Well, they just kinda, sorta, maybe wanted a little oversight down there in Florida,” the Constitution says that the Congress will make no Bill of Attainder or ex post facto law.</p>
<p>MAHER: Yes.</p>
<p>WEST: That’s right, that’s right. </p>
<p>BALDWIN: And that means that you cannot make a law specific to one event, which is exactly what they did.</p>
<p>GOLDBERG: Yes, but so many things are changing, this can’t be a surprise to people. You know, I mean, every time you turn around, there’s some new shit that you didn’t know anything about. [laughter] [applause]</p>
<p>BALDWIN: But the last – the last thing I wanted to say was he said, “Well, they just wanted kinda, sort of a little oversight.” What they wanted to do is what they always do, which is they wanted to get on their knees and press their lips as hard as they can on the ass of the conservative Christian right in this country. [applause] That’s what the Congress did.</p>
<p>WEST: I think that’s the crucial point. I think that the Christian right has sent a chilling effect vis-à-vis our politicians and fellow citizens. And I think we simply need courageous folks, be it Christian, Jewish, Buddhist, agnostic, atheistic, “Latterturnarian” or whatever, and say, “We have a radical separation between state and church, state and synagogue, state and temple. We have equality under the law.” </p>
<p>And in the end, what the right is really talking about, be they Christian or non-Christian, is power, power, power. And it’s tied to greed, greed, greed. We have to simply say that for what it is. And it has little to do with the Bible, though, Bill. Has little to do with the Bible, little to do with Jesus, little do to with Amos, little to do with Hosea, little to do with Micah. The Bible is not about power, power, power. It’s about justice, justice, justice, and love, love, love. [applause] That’s a very different perspective. [cheers]</p>
<p>MAHER: Yeah, and – and plenty of people who don’t have a Bible can believe that and come to that without the Bible.</p>
<p>WEST: Absolutely. But it’s – it helps to have a little—</p>
<p>MAHER: [overlapping] But for George Bush to say that what we should always do is “err on the side of life,” come on, this is a guy who executed, like—</p>
<p>GOLDBERG: I was going to say—</p>
<p>MAHER: --how many people down in Texas?</p>
<p>GOLDBERG: You know.</p>
<p>MAHER: Some of them who didn’t have lawyers who were awake for the trial. Some of them who were retarded. For the guy who is like, “Oh, let’s always err on the side of life!”</p>
<p>WEST: He said yesterday, “The essence of civilization is to ensure that you protect the strong against the weak.” And you say, if that’s the criteria, you’ve got a highly uncivilized administration. [laughter] [applause]</p>
<p>GOLDBERG: Yeah.</p>
<p>MAHER: Also, excuse me, not to be sacrilegious in any way, but this poor woman was not weak. She was gone. Okay, there’s a difference between weak and gone. I’m sorry, but she died—</p>
<p>GOLDBERG: You know what’s pissing me off?</p>
<p>MAHER: [overlapping]—your brain, you are your brain.</p>
<p>GOLDBERG: You know what’s bothering me more than anything, than anything that I’ve seen, is the fact that she has ceased being a person and become a cause. No one has said, “A woman died today.”</p>
<p>WEST: That’s right. [applause]</p>
<p>GOLDBERG: A woman, a person died today, you know.</p>
<p>MAHER: But she didn’t die today. She died a long time ago.</p>
<p>GOLDBERG: Well, but you know what? She may have, Bill. And that is a question that is going to haunt the parents and the husband. But what’s bothering me as I’m watching the vilification by people who don’t know anything about the husband, don’t know anything about the family—</p>
<p>WEST: That’s right.</p>
<p>GOLDBERG: --and I just – it’s so normal to us now. The vilification. You don’t even have to prove shit. You can just say, “You know that’s what happened,” and nobody questions it. And, I’m sorry, good-bye, Terri Schiavo, whenever you went, go in peace, girl, go in peace. [applause] I just wanted to say that.</p>
<p>WEST: I agree with you.</p>
<p>GOLDBERG: For the person.</p>
<p>BALDWIN: But when you – when you look at someone in her husband’s position and you say you doubt his statements, and the conservative Christians who doubted, who think that he really tried to kill his wife, for whatever reason, I find that very unlikely. The average person – this guy worked in her service for four years and he became a nurse and studied nursing in order to help her. And then to say that he wanted to take her off of this support—</p>
<p>GOLDBERG: [overlapping] But who the hell are they? Who are they? They weren’t even there!</p>
<p>BALDWIN: No, no, that I know. But what I’m saying is—</p>
<p>GOLDBERG: [overlapping] That pisses me off. [laughter]</p>
<p>BALDWIN: --is that, to me, the whole thing played out, and then in the end – this is the thing that really upset me the most, the kind of buttoned it for me, was they had this priest on, this guy Pavone, who was this priest with Priests For Life.</p>
<p>MAHER: Yeah, Father Frank.</p>
<p>BALDWIN: This guy’s the yappiest priest I’ve ever seen in my life! [laughter] Okay, and I’m a Catholic. And he’s on TV, and he’s running his mouth about calling Schiavo a killer.</p>
<p>GOLDBERG: Yeah.</p>
<p>BALDWIN: I mean, he called – he condemned him, in the wake of all this, this guy who, if you take him at his word, he was merely fulfilling his wife’s dying wish.</p>
<p>MAHER: And Michael, the husband, was offered money by – that right-wing guy offered him a million dollars to divorce her. Somebody else offered even more. Yes. And he did not take the money. And when they talk about morals and values, I always say morals and values are things, you know, you can actually measure. You know, they’re just not pie-in-the-sky things. And when somebody offers you a million dollars and you value what your wife’s wishes were more, that to me is a value. That is making a value judgment. [applause]</p>
<p>BALDWIN: Yes.</p>
<p>MAHER: A million dollars/my wife’s wishes. Keep your money, fatso.</p>
<p>BALDWIN: And similar to that, and concurrent with that, was I do feel very bad for her father, because this is a guy who – what he lost was he lost in the eyes of—</p>
<p>GOLDBERG: His child.</p>
<p>BALDWIN: --his child, and he lost in the eyes of Florida law. Because the reason that the husband was able to terminate her life and had – because he had legal guardianship – is that’s what the law says in Florida.</p>
<p>GOLDBERG: Well, that’s – when you get married, you know, “Who gives this woman in marriage?” It’s all set up from the beginning. Your husband and my wife or whatever, you have the right for me to whisper on the pillow. I don’t have to prove to anybody else. I just have to tell you. Now, the fact that, you know, this is a decision none of us ever want to have to make.</p>
<p>MAHER: But that’s the law.</p>
<p>GOLDBERG: You know, none of us want to have to make it. I don’t know if I could be as devoted as the Schindler family was. I don’t know if I could be as devoted as Michael. But certainly this idea of people judging without merit, you know, people saying, “Well, you know, she – we had all this information.” I’m thinking, this woman was in this state for 15 years! If she was going to raise up and say, “Save me,” she would have said it at some point! [laughter]</p>
<p>MAHER: Right. I mean—[applause]</p>
<p>GOLDBERG: Somebody would have had a camera and said, “Come on, Terri, say it again, say it again, girl!” [laughter] But that’s not what happened.</p>
<p>WEST: She’d already told her husband.</p>
<p>GOLDBERG: Yeah.</p>
<p>WEST: “If I’m in this state, I make a difference between biological life and biographical life, my biological life has persisted, my biographical is over, if you find me in that state, honey, please pull the plug.” This is family values, family values!</p>
<p>MAHER: Right, I mean, it’s getting to the point where the technology, it seems, is so far ahead of where we have gone, morally, or in our ways of being able to think about things – the technology will probably will allow us all to live forever, if you define living by just breathing. That’s where the bar is.</p>
<p>GOLDBERG: Yeah, that’s the question.</p>
<p>BALDWIN: And here’s the – and here’s the other thing that I think is kind of a quantum leap that we may be faced with, and this is what I’m concerned about, and that is that if – let’s say a future Terri Schiavo was in that position and her husband is her legal guardian, and laws are passed where you can’t end their life unless you have a living will. </p>
<p>And now it doesn’t take just a Schindler family member to come forward and challenge that; anyone can challenge that. Some conservative Christian guy running for Congress in Florida is going to step up and go, “Don’t pull the plug on her; I’ll take care of her and my organization will take care of her.” </p>
<p>And you’re going to politicize this issue unless these laws are changed. I think, to me, when the dust settles out, what we need is a clarification and a homogeneity, a consistency in laws for end of life and for living will laws, for all people. [applause]</p>
<p>GOLDBERG: Yeah.</p>
<p>MAHER: But it’s different to different people. I really think that for some people, their life is so sort of dull and inert that it’s not that different to live in that state. [laughter] I mean, if you’re – seriously, I mean, if you’re living without…</p>
<p>BALDWIN: [indicating Whoopi] This is why she wouldn’t marry me when we worked together, because I saw her bank account, baby. [laughter]</p>
<p>GOLDBERG: That’s right, you know. [laughter]</p>
<p>BALDWIN: She wouldn’t do that living will with me. [laughter]</p>
<p>WEST: No, I think – for me, the important thing is that, in no matter what state, you want the person to have dignity. And the sad thing about this charade that we’ve seen this week—</p>
<p>MAHER: Right.</p>
<p>WEST: --is that we made it a travesty, we made it a vulgarity, and we saw so much mendacity. Take, for example, the fact that we have a report that says that the U.S. Army is responsible, and the U.S. government responsible for killing 26 prisoners. Little talk about that. “Weapon of mass distraction,” in talking about this particular dear sister who we all love, Sister Terri. [applause] But there’s other deaths that are going on every day.</p>
<p>MAHER: Oh, yes.</p>
<p>WEST: And we get these right-wing fellow citizens who are so obsessed with the right to die and the right to live, and the folk who are actually living are actually getting crushed in ways that we don’t want to confront and we don’t want to come to terms with.</p>
<p>MAHER: But having – now that I have three godless liberals here. [laughter]</p>
<p>WEST: No, I’m not godless now, Bill. </p>
<p>MAHER: I was—</p>
<p>WEST: We’ve got a Catholic brother here.</p>
<p>MAHER: I know, I know.</p>
<p>WEST: You got a serious Holy Ghost Baptist in me. [laughter] And Sister Whoopi got so much spirituality in her, that’s sure.</p>
<p>BALDWIN: She got an Oscar.</p>
<p>MAHER: Yes, sweetheart, it was ironic. [laughter]</p>
<p>WEST: Oh, I got you. I got you.</p>
<p>MAHER: I was just, you know, throwing a piece of meat to the right wing there. I was kidding. I know.</p>
<p>WEST: I’m sorry.</p>
<p>MAHER: Okay. [laughter] But we have three people on the left. Kerry voters, shall we call them.</p>
<p>GOLDBERG: No.</p>
<p>MAHER: People who don’t wear a flag on their lapel, but still love their country. Okay, whatever it is. [laughter] [applause] How come we – how come we have become the “silent majority.” You know, when I was a kid, the “silent majority” was who Nixon said, “You know, that’s not the hippies in the street. They’re making all the noise, the hippies, burning the flags and burning their bras and protesting the war. But there’s a real ‘silent majority.’” And you know, he was probably right.</p>
<p>Okay, now the people in the streets are the conservative Christians. They’re making all the noise. But, you know, the majority of the people thought, yeah, this woman should be let go; it should be a private affair. The majority of people thought the assault weapons ban should be – you know, there’s a lot of issues—</p>
<p>WEST: [overlapping] Don’t want to privatize Social Security.</p>
<p>MAHER: --there was a majority of people who weren’t for impeaching Bill Clinton for his blowjob. Okay, so how come the majority can’t take the country?</p>
<p>BALDWIN: Because the majority of people, Democrat or Republican, live in a moderate midsection of this country, and the Republican Party, the once great Republican Party in this country, has been hijacked by – the leadership class of the Republican Party, is a conservative Christian looney bin who’s taken over the party. [applause] [cheers]</p>
<p>You know, I just want to say it’s very important – it’s very important for the purposes of that discussion to always distinguish Republican rank-and-file from Republican leadership. Most Republicans who are registered Republicans—</p>
<p>MAHER: Yes.</p>
<p>BALDWIN: --are decent, honest, good people who you have a difference of opinion with. [applause] The leadership of the Republican Party are a bunch of sociopathic maniacs—[laughter]—who have their lips super-glued to the ass of the conservative right. [applause]</p>
<p>WEST: You can’t – you can’t overlook the role of corporate elites here, because there’s a sense in which a lot of these social issues are just smokescreens for corporate power and the way in which that redistribution of wealth from poor and working people to the well-to-do still takes place. </p>
<p>But we have to say something about the milquetoast Democratic Party, too. </p>
<p>GOLDBERG: Now, listen, there’s—</p>
<p>BALDWIN: [overlapping] You guys. I’ll let you say it.</p>
<p>GOLDBERG: --there’s not a ball between them. [laughter] [applause] There’s not a ball between them. And I have no – you know—</p>
<p>WEST: I’m telling you.</p>
<p>GOLDBERG: I – I believed at one point that we – we would have the ability to rise up and get people to see. Because basically the things that we talk about are good for the country. They really are smart and they are good. And there are ways to get the things that we want. But as Clinton said in one of his speeches, “Until we’re ready to stand behind what we believe, we’re never going to win.” And I watched. I saw it happen.</p>
<p>WEST: That’s right.</p>
<p>GOLDBERG: I watched the de-balling of the Democratic Party. And I watched them do it to themselves.</p>
<p>WEST: That’s true. That’s true.</p>
<p>GOLDBERG: They ripped – wait, baby – they ripped themselves open and said, “Fine, whatever you guys – you say we shouldn’t be talking about it; okay, we’re not going to talk about that.” We totally forgot who and what direction we were supposed to be going in. And whether you liked Howard Dean or not, or whether you liked Gephardt or any of these other cats, I at least think they would have stood up. </p>
<p>Now, Kerry had a perfect opportunity to stand up and say, “You know what? I came back from Vietnam. I told you what I saw. I was over there. And of course, then there was Mi Lai and there was all these other things, but I told you what I saw, in the face of all these people screaming at me. And that’s what I’ll do for you as president.” </p>
<p>MAHER: Yeah, right.</p>
<p>GOLDBERG: If he had put his nuts on the table—[applause]</p>
<p>WEST: He needed to come forward.</p>
<p>GOLDBERG: --he’d have been right—</p>
<p>MAHER: If he only was the guy he had been in 1971.</p>
<p>WEST: Absolutely.</p>
<p>MAHER: To find a hero in his life, he only would have to look at his scrapbook. Yes, I know.</p>
<p>GOLDBERG: He only had to look in the mirror. And he’d – you know. </p>
<p>MAHER: But 30 years in Washington, yeah, that’s what happened.</p>
<p>WEST: But you’ve got the legacy of Paul Wellstone. You’ve got Barbara Lee. You’ve got Jesse Jackson, Jr. – a little different than “Sr.,” we’ll get to that – in terms of speaking up. But they are on the margins of the party. The party, for the most part, has deferred to centrist sensibilities, so there’s no vision, there’s no conviction, there’s no serious execution.</p>
<p>BALDWIN: And the party also – I mean, as a Democratic, the party also, sometimes I believe – and this is just an opinion – that they almost – some Democratic leadership people, they can’t believe what they come up against. They’re kind of like stricken. If I’m with you at a country club and I pick up a bottle and smash you in the face with a beer – you know, you don’t see it coming. I think that Kerry kind of stood there and thought, “you mean you’re going to make me out to be a coward?”</p>
<p>MAHER: Right, right.</p>
<p>BALDWIN: “And the bad guy with the Swift Boat thing? And you’re going to make this little weasel out to be a war hero?!” [laughter] </p>
<p>MAHER: Right.</p>
<p>GOLDBERG: And then – and then—</p>
<p>BALDWIN: “When he was hiding down there raising money for his father?” [applause]</p>
<p>GOLDBERG: But you know what?</p>
<p>BALDWIN: He couldn’t believe. So it’s the big lie for you.</p>
<p>GOLDBERG: [overlapping] But the idea that he let it happen.</p>
<p>BALDWIN: And they did it to McCain. They did it to McCain.</p>
<p>GOLDBERG: But that – you know what? That was in the control – it was in our hands. It was in our control. And the party just kind of went—</p>
<p>BALDWIN: He reacted badly to it.</p>
<p>GOLDBERG: --no, no, no, don’t do that; don’t piss anybody off; don’t talk to the wrong people.</p>
<p>BALDWIN: Yeah, they’re too civil.</p>
<p>GOLDBERG: I have those guys stuck in my behind right now. [laughter]</p>
<p>MAHER: But I still think—</p>
<p>GOLDBERG: The Democrats – I have the Democrats stuck in my behind, and I’m mad. I’m mad because not one of them stood up and said, “Wait a minute, in this country, you can have a dissenting opinion. It is not un-American. It is not wrong to say, ‘I believe this is wrong.’ That is the foundation of why we’re great.” [applause]</p>
<p>MAHER: And it’s also not wrong – and not un-American – to say, “My religion, whatever it is, is none of your business.”</p>
<p>GOLDBERG: That’s right. [applause]</p>
<p>MAHER: And I’m telling you, until that one party does that, that is where it has to begin. The guy on “The West Wing,” Alan Alda, is doing it, and he’s a Republican! [laughter] All right, speaking of religion, I wanted to show you this picture.</p>
<p>BALDWIN: You know where we’re more likely to hear that phrase first, who’s going to say that, right?</p>
<p>MAHER: What do you mean?</p>
<p>BALDWIN: “My religion is none of your business.” The first political leader who is going to say that?</p>
<p>MAHER: Who?</p>
<p>BALDWIN: I’ll give you a hint. [voice of Arnold Schwarzenegger] “My religion is none of your business!” [laughter] [applause]</p>
<p>MAHER: Yeah, you’re right.</p>
<p>BALDWIN: He’s going to do it first.</p>
<p>MAHER: Right.</p>
<p>BALDWIN: He’s the moderate Republican that’s going right down the middle. He’s going to jam the ball in the hoop. He is.</p>
<p>WEST: But you know what? Phil Angelides is going to take care of him in California.</p>
<p>BALDWIN: Is he?</p>
<p>WEST: Oh, yes. Phil Angelides is going to take care of him.</p>
<p>MAHER: [laughing] All right, I have this – this made me laugh so hard that I have to show it to you because I have a comedy show. [laughter] [holds up photo of group of Jerusalem religious leaders] This was on the front page of the New York Times the other day. These are the religious leaders of Jerusalem, who rarely get together. Jerusalem, as you might have read over the last hundred years, has been the sight of a little bit of conflict. Okay, now there are – and they came together to agree on one thing, which is that fags must go. [laughter]</p>
<p>This, over here, this guy with the – looks like he’s got a strawberry shortcake on his head—[laughter]—that’s the Muslim – that’s the mufti. This is the Catholic guy with the bling-bling. [laughter] [applause] This is apparently somebody from “Star Wars” or “Star Trek.” [laughter] Or he’s a Klingon. I don’t what this guy is. [laughter] It’s the funny hat club. Here’s Carnak the Magnificent. [laughter] He is—</p>
<p>BALDWIN: Captain Hook.</p>
<p>MAHER: That’s one of the – one of the rabbis. And an Abe Lincoln impersonator. [laughter] And the paper said this man was “not identified.” [laughter] I’m sure he’s relieved. </p>
<p>Okay, first of all, now, they got – because they’re planning a gay pride parade in Jerusalem. So all the religious leaders got together – I love this – first of all, this looks like a gay pride parade right here. [laughter] [applause] I mean, this is just one penis-popsicle short of a gay pride parade. [laughter] Look, there’s everything but the construction worker. [laughter] </p>
<p>But I just think it’s hysterical that all these people think the other people, on fundamental issues – what could be more fundamental than the person I think is god, you don’t think is god – okay, we’re going to put that aside. You know, they’ve been fighting over who’s god, they’ve been fighting over whose land it is. Fags cannot come here. [laughter] But that is one thing the funny-hat club can agree on—</p>
<p>WEST: Brings them all together.</p>
<p>MAHER: --is that: No fags. We will…</p>
<p>BALDWIN: They sit there saying, “I hate you, I hate you, I hate you! There’s only one thing I hate more than you: fags, I hate more than you. That I hate more than you.” [laughter] [applause] How awful.</p>
<p>MAHER: It’s just beyond me.</p>
<p>WEST: The fact, you know, Brother Bill, is that we’re really talking about intolerance, and it’s actually on the verge of ugly bigotry. And we had to just say that. [applause] Because when you look at those faces – you look at those faces, well, you’ve got Catholics – well, Catholics were up against ugly forms of intolerance in America and other places; you’ve got Jews, vicious forms of bigotry and hatred, all coming together against another group now? Human, human, all too human…[laughter]</p>
<p>MAHER: You see why I don’t like religion? All right, let’s go to Jesse Jackson. He, of course, the founder and president of the PUSH Coalition, who is in the news as a counselor to both the parents of Terri Schiavo and Michael Jackson. Please welcome somebody I’m proud to say is my friend, the Reverend Jesse Jackson. Reverend! [applause] [cheers] How are you? </p>
<p>REV. JESSE JACKSON: Fine.</p>
<p>MAHER: Okay, so I think what everybody wants to know is – we saw you down there in Florida last week – how could you, of all people, throw in with the likes of Tom DeLay and Rick Santorum?</p>
<p>JACKSON: I threw in with Terri, who I felt was being induced to die through starvation and dehydration. For that I found no moral or ethical foundation. I have been in situations where people were dying with cancer and went into a coma and had Demerol to kill the pain, and their pulse began to go down, and you pull the tube and they die. And I think that was her case. </p>
<p>Now what I found stranger are that there are those who embraced Terri, the person, who would not embrace the policies that sustained her. She was sustained in part by, what? A medical malpractice lawsuit. By medical aid, by long-term health care, and by parents and a husband who have a job. And so I embrace the person. I do not think it was right to pull that feeding and hydration tube on her.</p>
<p>MAHER: But you know that the Republicans are trying to make inroads to the black vote through the Christian right because a lot of black folks go to church and are very susceptible to that appeal. Don’t you think you are providing yourself as a bridge for that?</p>
<p>JACKSON: No, I think addressing her situation, to me, was the moral center. There was neither a political left nor right. I know there are those who love the fetus, who will not support daycare and childcare and a job in education. They stop at the person. [applause] And there are those who embrace Terri, the person, who will not embrace long-term health care and will not support Medicare. </p>
<p>I thought the Congress was wrong to use its power to try to intimidate the courts and violate separation of powers. They should be focused on health-care policies and appropriations, not on a person. They were out of place. Tom DeLay threatening the courts and threatening people is out of place. Those who threaten Michael Schiavo, they are out of place. But somehow Terri, the person, and her quest for food and water, I thought that was particularly – a particular concern that I have. And to this day, I still am glad I stood with her and her family. [applause]</p>
<p>MAHER: But, you know, I don’t understand. I asked this question a couple of weeks ago when this story broke. I don’t understand how the people who claim to be most spiritual seem most reluctant to get on to the next life. [laughter] And this is one reason I admire the Pope. The Pope is consistent. The Pope said, “Don’t bring me back to the hospital. I hear God calling me. Let’s just keep me in my apartment and I’ll go when I go.” And it just seems like God is calling and he comes to the door, and you stick your foot in it. You know, it’s like Michael Jackson: “No, no, don’t get me, I’m in my pajamas! I’m too sick to go to court today!” [laughter]</p>
<p>JACKSON: Well, the Pope—</p>
<p>MAHER: [overlapping] It seems like God—</p>
<p>JACKSON: --the Pope has had the best of medical care, including a feeding tube, and he’s holding on as long as he can. In the Pope’s situation tonight, and we do pray for him in this critical hour, he’s had the joy of a life of service, and then the joy of a life eternal of expectation. So the Pope is in his transition. And I would like to think that we all pray for him tonight. But the Pope has used every medical access known to man to stay alive as long as he could stay.</p>
<p>MAHER: Well, okay. All right, I’m not going to argue that point. I don’t think so. I think they could probably keep him alive longer, and I don’t think he’s doing that. But let me ask – I brought up Michael Jackson. I know you can’t talk a lot about it, but I know you do pray with him on a daily basis. He compared himself this week to Jack Johnson, Muhammad Ali and Nelson Mandela. [laughter] Now, as a – as a Civil Rights leader who has really, really faced the battlements – I mean, you were there with Martin Luther King when he was shot; you marched; I mean, you faced the fire hoses – you’ve got to – this has got to bother you. </p>
<p>Just the way Kobe Bryant was out of line when he compared himself and used a Martin Luther King quote; he said, “An injustice anywhere is an injustice everywhere.” And, you know, Martin Luther King said that when he was confronting racism in jail in Alabama. Kobe was confronting some knee cartilage and trying to get some “affirmative action” in Colorado. [laughter] ][applause] This must upset you when people take this – when it’s really not a racial issue.</p>
<p>JACKSON: Well, Michael – Michael feels himself to be persecuted. But I think the context of this – the context of his statement was simply this: we all love Nelson Mandela tonight. For 27 years, we saw him as a terrorist. We’ve loved him since 1990. We all love Dr. King today. He was killed as one of America’s most hated men, with a target on his back. We all love Jack Johnson now. He was locked out of the ring because of his race. And so the point is, whether you are Jack Johnson or Paul Robeson or Martin King or Mandela, seemingly when blacks hit very high spots, they’re in the line of fire. Michael perceives himself to be in that line, and that’s the basis of his statement.</p>
<p>Now, whether he’s persecuted or now, well, in the end, we’ll see. What I do know about the Michael case – I have prayed with him; I’ve known him since he was six years old – is that when a sheriff goes into somebody’s house with 70 armed guards, as if they’re facing armed resistance, and then ransacks the house and destroys their paintings, their art, their furniture, and then take those items and give them to the press, have the press come inside the house and say, all who may be witness, come – come and let’s testify. That’s unusual. Michael, like others, deserved dignity and due process. I think at that level, he was denied it. [applause]</p>
<p>MAHER: Okay, Reverend Jackson, I know this was hard for you back there in Chicago, after all your difficult week and your time down there. I really appreciate you taking time out for us as always. Thank you. Reverend Jesse Jackson, everybody. [applause]</p>
<p>JACKSON: Thank you, Bill. </p>
<p>MAHER: What do you think about that? I mean, it seems like these cases are not really—</p>
<p>GOLDBERG: [overlapping] You know what?</p>
<p>WEST: [overlapping] Brother Bill—</p>
<p>GOLDBERG: [overlapping] You have to understand, you have to understand, it is a different world. It is a different world. It’s not just the world of celebrity. But also, for Michael, a lot of what’s happening to him is because he’s – he’s vastly different than everybody else. [laughter]</p>
<p>MAHER: But is that because he’s black?</p>
<p>GOLDBERG: In part, yes.</p>
<p>MAHER: Really? If this was country singer Alan Jackson sleeping with young boys?</p>
<p>GOLDBERG: [overlapping] You know what? Wait, wait. You know what? You know what? I know in my heart that I don’t want to say that race is a factor in our lives, but it actually is. And oftentimes, it is easier – and I don’t mean this in any disrespectful way – it is oftentimes easier for white people to go, “Now, come on,” because they don’t know. Because it’s little, tiny stuff.</p>
<p>MAHER: I agree with that.</p>
<p>GOLDBERG: It’s little—</p>
<p>MAHER: But not him.</p>
<p>GOLDBERG: Why not him? [voices overlap]</p>
<p>MAHER: Everybody but him.</p>
<p>WEST: Part of the problem – part of the problem is this, though—</p>
<p>GOLDBERG: He married Elvis’ daughter, child, people threw themselves out the window! [laughter]</p>
<p>WEST: But, Sister Whoopi, Robbers Island is a different place than Neverland. [laughter] You see what I mean? So that race can matter, but you’ve got to couch your language in such a way that somehow you don’t confuse the gravitas of one situation vis-à-vis another. So if race might still be a factor among a whole host of other factors—</p>
<p>GOLDBERG: A whole host.</p>
<p>WEST: --but you invoke Nelson Mandela! [laughter] Twenty-seven years in prison! [applause]</p>
<p>MAHER: That’s right.</p>
<p>GOLDBERG: But you know what?</p>
<p>WEST: What are you talking about?</p>
<p>BALDWIN: But I think—</p>
<p>WEST: You see what I mean. That’s the problem. Whoopi’s point is still there, but he’s gone hyperbolic!</p>
<p>GOLDBERG: But you know what it is? But you know what it is?</p>
<p>WEST: Yeah.</p>
<p>GOLDBERG: Whenever people want to make a huge point, they use the most obvious person.</p>
<p>WEST: They have to.</p>
<p>GOLDBERG: They have to. Because if he said, “Listen, I’m, you know, as good as…you know, I don’t know who to say because I know you all won’t know who the fuck I’m talking about!” [laughter] But you know, is it wrong for him to compare – I don’t think he was saying, “I’m this person, I’m this person.” I think what he’s saying—</p>
<p>MAHER: But he’s played that race card before.</p>
<p>GOLDBERG: The race card is played every day!</p>
<p>BALDWIN: But you notice on the subject of racism, these two, they just don’t want the white man to have his say here. [laughter] He’s not lettin’ me open my mouth here! [applause]</p>
<p>GOLDBERG: We’re trying to shame your ass! [laughter]</p>
<p>BALDWIN: You’re trying to silence me. Trying to silence me! [voices overlap]</p>
<p>GOLDBERG: We’ve got a Christian right that’s going to get your ass.</p>
<p>MAHER: Hey, hey! Let—</p>
<p>WEST: He’s going to speak right now. [laughter]</p>
<p>BALDWIN: I just wanted – no, I just wanted to say that I think that if you are a guy who has a reputation for living an alternative lifestyle—[laughter]—and you are known far and wide for that reason – and this is an individual thing and this is a very unique situation – and you are at your home, and you are inconceivably wealthy. And someone comes into your home and you give them the booze and you’re watching the Internet porn and you’re doing this, then that guy runs out the door and he sues you for trying to do something, you’ve got every – you got everything coming to you that you deserve, because you’re an idiot that you would put yourself in that position. [applause]</p>
<p>GOLDBERG: Well, here’s my question—</p>
<p>BALDWIN: He’s a dumb-ass, that he put himself—</p>
<p>GOLDBERG: [overlapping]—’93, the first year he was talked about – ’93, right?</p>
<p>BALDWIN: [overlapping] He should have known people were going to go after his money.</p>
<p>GOLDBERG: ’93 was the first time.</p>
<p>BALDWIN: They’re soaking him.</p>
<p>GOLDBERG: Why would – now, see, if somebody touched my kid or I thought somebody touched my kid, I would break every bone in my body.</p>
<p>BALDWIN: Yeah, do it—</p>
<p>GOLDBERG: I would – I would toss them. I would beat the hell out of them. There’s not enough money you could pay me to make it okay.</p>
<p>BALDWIN: Here’s your gun controls. [laughter]</p>
<p>GOLDBERG: So how come these parents—</p>
<p>MAHER: Yeah.</p>
<p>GOLDBERG: --allow this – allowed this. Just getting away from Michael for a second, because, to me, you couldn’t do that to my kid. You could not – you could not pay me enough money—</p>
<p>BALDWIN: Yeah.</p>
<p>GOLDBERG: --I would not bring my child to you.</p>
<p>BALDWIN: Yeah.</p>
<p>GOLDBERG: Because if I think you’re going to touch him, I’m going to kill you. [laughter]</p>
<p>BALDWIN: But I just feel like, I feel like—[applause]</p>
<p>GOLDBERG: I’m sorry, somebody should be talking to the parents.</p>
<p>BALDWIN: I agree with you that it’s both. But what I really think is that for a guy that had all that power at his disposal, Neverland had everything but a good screening policy. [laughter] The wrong people got in there, you know what I mean?</p>
<p>WEST: All Michael has got to say is, “I want to make sure I have a fair trial.” Period.</p>
<p>MAHER: Yeah. </p>
<p>BALDWIN: I think he’s getting a fair trial.</p>
<p>MAHER: You know, okay. [voices overlap]</p>
<p>GOLDBERG: Oh, yeah, right, okay. [voices overlap]</p>
<p>MAHER: You don’t think he’s getting a fair trial?</p>
<p>BALDWIN: The jury is in their pajamas.</p>
<p>GOLDBERG: Has he ever been in?</p>
<p>MAHER: What happened?</p>
<p>GOLDBERG: Has he ever been to court yet? Every time I look, he’s like in the bed. He’s in the bed. [laughter]</p>
<p>MAHER: No, he’s – he’s been to court. </p>
<p>GOLDBERG: Just wanted to make sure.</p>
<p>MAHER: The other kid-touching story in the news this week, the Boy Scout leader, this guy, Doug Smith, he’s a former top Boy Scout official, was hauled up on child porn charges. We have a picture of him. I think you probably – there he is. [insert: photo of Alec Baldwin as Scout leader in film still] [laughter] [applause]</p>
<p>BALDWIN: And that’s wrong, by the way. That was wrong for that man to have done what he did in that show. That was terrible. [laughter]</p>
<p>MAHER: Show the real picture of this guy.</p>
<p>BALDWIN: I bet he’ll be in hell with Bill O’Reilly.</p>
<p>MAHER: [insert: photo of accused Scout leader] I, of course, would never say that anyone should be guilty just by looking at their picture, but in this case, I am willing to make an exception. [laughter] This guy looks like – just that picture—[laughs]—he must have been – no. But here’s the thing. I’m actually – he is – underage sex is completely vile. We all agree on that. I took R Kelly right off my Christmas card list when that shit went down. [laughter] But this guy is really being sent to jail for a thought-crime. Okay? It’s not a good thing to do, to look at pictures of boys, but it is – we have to pause here and say, okay, we are sending someone to jail for looking at pictures. He never tried to contact kids. He never gave them “Jesus Juice.” He never said, “I have a Ferris Wheel at my house.” [laughter] He didn’t do anything. It is a thought crime. So where do you liberals stand on that?</p>
<p>WEST: Well, first, Bill, all the challenges that the Homeland Security Department has, they’re keeping track—</p>
<p>MAHER: Right.</p>
<p>WEST: --of this guy.</p>
<p>MAHER: This was a Homeland Security operation. “Operation Predator.”</p>
<p>WEST: Where is the priorities here? We’ve got terrorist attacks coming around the corner.</p>
<p>MAHER: Right. You’re right.</p>
<p>WEST: We’ve got threats coming around, and they’re keeping track of this little guy’s thing?</p>
<p>MAHER: Right, because children in America – it was protecting children. Their job is to protect all of us.</p>
<p>GOLDBERG: It’s kind of late for them to be protecting children when the pictures are already up. The pictures are done! The children are not protected. [applause] Who are they protecting them from? Some photographer is standing around taking pictures of little kids buck naked, trying to have sex.</p>
<p>MAHER: Right.</p>
<p>GOLDBERG: Those are the people, for me, who they need to be looking for.</p>
<p>BALDWIN: Yeah, I agree.</p>
<p>GOLDBERG: Those are the people we need to be looking for. [applause]</p>
<p>WEST: Absolutely. Absolutely.</p>
<p>MAHER: Okay. And the Boy Scouts of America, everyone is shocked that there’s gay activity. [laughter] I mean, can we get over that? I mean, there’s a reason—</p>
<p>GOLDBERG: Let’s not call that gay activity.</p>
<p>BALDWIN: There’s gambling here at Rick’s Café.</p>
<p>MAHER: Yes.</p>
<p>GOLDBERG: Let’s not talk – let’s not call that.</p>
<p>WEST: But don’t you find it interesting, though, the new report that you talked about, 9/11, no one takes responsibility, no answerability—</p>
<p>MAHER: Right.</p>
<p>WEST: --no accountability whatsoever.</p>
<p>MAHER: Right, you know what? I’m not only sick of the ineptitude by the agencies themselves, but how about the commissions? Every commission doesn’t have the balls to—</p>
<p>WEST: They don’t have the courage to follow through!</p>
<p>MAHER: --they always stop at – they say, “The CIA got it wrong.” They never say, “Okay, the President demanded that they get it wrong.” [applause]</p>
<p>BALDWIN: Did you – what did you think of the 9/11 Commission Report?</p>
<p>MAHER: It was better than this one.</p>
<p>BALDWIN: Right.</p>
<p>WEST: They had more courage, but they still didn’t follow through on accountability.</p>
<p>MAHER: Right. But they still – right.</p>
<p>WEST: [overlapping] All the way up. So when it comes to the weakest and the most vulnerable, “You must be responsible, you must be responsible.” When it comes to the powerful, “Evasion, evasion.” [applause]</p>
<p>MAHER: Right.</p>
<p>BALDWIN: I’ll tell you, one of the things that I felt was – one of the things I felt was a real shame is that someone who emerged from the 9/11 Commission hearings who I think was really, really a great American and did a great job under very difficult circumstances, was Keane, the former governor of—</p>
<p>MAHER: Absolutely, my state, New Jersey.</p>
<p>BALDWIN: He was a great hero. [voices overlap]</p>
<p>MAHER: Yes, right, wouldn’t be intimidated by anybody.</p>
<p>BALDWIN: A moderate Republican.</p>
<p>MAHER: Right, in an era of partisanship, one of the few people who said, “No, no, I’m an American.”</p>
<p>WEST: Absolutely.</p>
<p>BALDWIN: Played it straight. Great American.</p>
<p>WEST: Princeton man, too. [laughter]</p>
<p>MAHER: Yeah, you’re right. All right. Time for New Rules, everybody. [applause] [cheers]</p>
<p>All right, New Rule: I’m not an expert on child psychology, but I’m willing to go out on a limb and say any student who makes his hair into horns deserves a little extra watching. [laughter]</p>
<p>New Rule: You don’t get a million dollars just for being gay. Remember Dick Cheney’s daughter Mary, the one John Kerry mentioned was a lesbian, and the Republicans pretended to get all irate about it? Well, she just got a million-dollar advance to write her memoirs. Memoirs? “Chapter One: my dad’s vice president. Chapter Two: I like pussy.” The End. [laughter] [applause]</p>
<p>BALDWIN: Oh, my God.</p>
<p>WEST: Bill.</p>
<p>MAHER: What? Sometimes I have politicians here and I can’t do these jokes. [laughter] It’s nice when I have three godless liberals. Once again, just a joke. [laughter]</p>
<p>New Rule: Stop bringing out DVD’s so soon! I’m still ignoring you in the theater! [laughter]</p>
<p>New Rule: Don’t eat anything that’s served to you out a window unless you’re a seagull. [laughter] [applause] People are acting all shocked that a human finger was found in a bowl of Wendy’s chili. Hey, it cost less than a dollar. What did you expect it to contain? Trout? [laughter] [applause] Luckily, it was only a finger! If it was a whole hand, Congress would have voted to keep it alive. [laughter] [applause] [cheers]</p>
<p>WEST: [laughing] That’s a serious joke right there.</p>
<p>MAHER: And finally, New Rule: Abstinence pledges make you horny. [laughter] In a setback for the morals/values crowd, a new eight-year study just released reveals that American teenagers who take virginity pledges wind up with just as many STD’s as the other kids. [laughter] But that’s not all. “Taking the pledge” also makes a teenage girl six times more likely to perform oral sex, and four times more likely to allow anal. [laughter] Which leads me to an important question: where were these pledges when I was in high school? [laughter] [applause]</p>
<p>So, seriously, when I was a teenager, the only kids having anal intercourse, were the ones who missed. [laughter] [applause] My idea of lubrication was oiling my bike chain. [laughter] If I had known I could have been getting porn-star sex the same year I took Algebra 2—[laughter]—simply by joining up with the Christian right—[laughter]—I’d have been so down with Jesus, they would have had to pry me out of the pew. [laughter] [applause] </p>
<p>And, let me tell you, there is a lot worse things than teenagers having sex. Namely, teenagers not having sex. Here is something you’ll never hear: “That suicide bomber blew himself up because he was having too much sex.” [laughter] “Sex, sex, sex, nonstop, all that crazy Arab ever had was sex, and look what happened.” [laughter] But among the puritans here of the 21st century, the less said to kids about sex, the better. Because people who talk about peepees are “potty-mouths.” [laughter]</p>
<p>And so, armed with limited knowledge and believing that regular, vaginal intercourse to be either immaculate or filthy dirty—[laughter]—these kids did with their pledge what everybody does with contracts. They found loopholes. [laughter] Two of them, to be exact. [laughter] [applause]</p>
<p>Is there any greater irony than the fact that the Christian right actually got their precious little adolescent daughters to say to their freshly-scrubbed boyfriends, “Please, I want to remain pure for my wedding night, so only in the ass.” [laughter] [applause] “And then I’ll blow you, I promise.” [laughter] Well, at least these kids are really thinking outside the box. [laughter] [applause]</p>
<p>Okay, that’s our show. I want to thank my guests, Bill O’Reilly, the Reverend Jesse Jackson, Dr. Cornel West, Alec Baldwin and Whoopi Goldberg. Thank you everybody. [applause] [cheers]</p>
