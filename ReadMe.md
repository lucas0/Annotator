# Issues to be addressed

## ~~Reset User Database~~

Using ```python manage.py flush```


## ~~Skip ```save_annotation()``` if username has "test" in it~~

## Make sure ```save_source.py``` is running

## Change radiobuttons to buttons

Also add function to take care of setting value of op and submitting form

## Add print to see which rows are selected an if they are found

## Use shuffled samples dataframe in ```get_least_annotated_page()```

Change shufling so that a new row is retrieved each time (to avoid infinite loops)

## ~~Remove automatic annotation~~

Instead just call the function again using ```aPage = none```

## Deal with Snopes "Learn More" message width issue
