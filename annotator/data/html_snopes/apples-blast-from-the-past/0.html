<p>The Apple I was the result of the development efforts of Steve
      Wozniak, Steve Jobs, and Ron Wayne. It was developed, not in
      a garage, but in the bedroom of Steve Wozniak's home on 11161
      Crist Drive in Los Altos (the house number was later changed
      to 2066). Steve Wozniak built the printed circuit-board, while
      Ron Wayne wrote the <a href="http://www.emulation.net/apple1/manual/apple1manx.html" target="_blank">Apple-1 Operation Manual</a> at his home. Steve
      Jobs did what he does best, advertising the Apple I to friends
      and family. They first previewed the Apple I in action during
      a May 1976 meeting of the Homebrew Computer Club. Paul Terell,
      the owner of the Byte Shop, the only computer store chain at
      the time, was impressed by what he saw and promised to buy 50
      fully assembled computers for $500 each. As you can see, the
      machine was intended for hobbyist that would add ASCII keyboards
      and displays after buying the bare circuit board. It was not
      meant to be pre-built with fully-assembled displays and attachments.
      Jobs insisted it could be done and with the help of Woz, Bill
      Fernandez (who introduced Jobs to Woz) and Daniel Kottke (a friend
      of Jobs) they were able to build by hand all 50 of the motherboards
      on the second-to-last day before their loaned parts were due.
      They were not the "fully assembled" computers Terell
      had asked for, but he paid the men the cash they needed to pay
      off loans and make a good profit. Apple later sold the Apple
      I for $666.66 before being replaced by the much more practical
      and user friendly <a href="aII.html">Apple II</a>.<font size="-1">

<b>Operating System:<br/>
</b>Woz built the Apple I to run BASIC, so games could be programmed
and played on it. It was a game machine for the most part. Woz
thought the binary switches of the Altair 8800 and similar PCs
were not user friendly enough so he wrote a BASIC language assembler
into the ROM by hand using only hex. The Apple I did allow you
to play around with the system using the 6502 disassembler though,
following the philosophy that every user should be allowed to
know everything about their computer. <br/>
<br/>
<b>Interesting Facts:<br/>
</b>Although the final pricing for the Apple I was $666.66, Jobs
originally wanted to sell it for $777.77. Woz insisted that this
price was to high so he agreed to sell it for $666. When he was
asked why he picked this number (the mark of Satan) he answered
that he just took a lucky number, 7, and subtracted one. <br/>
<br/>
Ron Wayne, the unknown third founder of Apple, left the company
shortly after Apple delivered their first order. The reason behind
this was because Jobs planned to go highly in debt to build large
quantities of the Apple I. Having lost a lot of money in other
investments with new computer companies, he wrote a letter of
resignation to Apple and gave back his 10% in Apple stock. He
received $500 in cash for the work he had done.<br/>
