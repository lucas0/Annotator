<p>His
work as a propagandist for Israel has been praised by the Israeli
Foreign Ministry as being key to Israel's long-term PR success [2]. </p>
<p>Recently whilst the Israeli army was slaughtering Palestinians 
                in Jenin, Nabulus and Bethlehem he made a provocative speech blaming 
                the Palestinians of terrorism, suggesting the intifada was a manifestation of anti-


 Semitism, and asked people to unite behind 
                Israel [3]. </p>
<p>At
a time when other businesses were desperately pulling out of Israel,
Starbucks decided to help Israel's floundering economy and invest in
Israel - a joint venture with Israeli conglomerate Delek Group for
Starbucks outlets in Israel ( Shalom Coffee Co).[4][5][6]. A bad
business decision - Starbucks made heavy losses and in April 2003
Starbucks were forced to announced that all 6 Starbucks cafes in Israel
will be shut down and its partnership with Delek end.[14]</p>
<p>It has been revealed that Starbucks still continues to support Israel by sponsoring fund raisers for Israel.[15] </p>

The Aish HaTorah, the main beneficiary of The Jerusalem Fund of Aish

<p>Howard Shultz warns American Jews against complacency</p>
<p>04/04/2002</p>
<p>Reported by Elisa Hahn, KING 5</p>
<p>SEATTLE - Divisions within the Jewish community were on display 
                    Thursday in Seattle as Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz criticized 
                    Palestinian inaction in the Middle East while others protested 
                    the Israeli occupation of Palestinian lands.</p>
<p>"If you leave this synagogue tonight and go back to 
                    your home and ignore this, then shame on us," Howard 
                    Schultz told a crowded temple of Jewish Americans on Seattle's 
                    Capitol Hill.</p>
<p>Schultz warned other Jews against sitting back and doing 
                    nothing.</p>
<p>"What is going on in the Middle East is not an isolated 
                    part of the world. The rise of anti-Semitism is at an all 
                    time high since the 1930's," he said.</p>
<p>"The Palestinians aren't doing their job they're not 
                    stopping terrorism."</p>
<p>While reaction inside the temple to Schultz's remarks grew 
                    from a warm reception to a standing ovation, the mood outside 
                    the temple was different.</p>
<p>A handful of Jews gathered there to protest the Israeli government's 
                    actions of late and their occupation of Palestinian lands.</p>
<p>There were similar sentiments Thursday at Seattle's Westlake 
                    center.</p>
<p>"We only get the side that talks about Palestinians 
                    as terrorists. As if all the civilians right now living in 
                    a state of siege and terror are terrorists and they're not," 
                    said protestor Alethea Mundy, whose younger brother is in 
                    Bethlehem doing relief work for Palestinian refugees.</p>
<p>She's worried about her brother, but realizes that everything 
                    is relative.</p>
<p>"This is what the Palestinians live with every day, 
                    two weeks is nothing for my brother,"</p>

<p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Starbucks to 
                    open here later in year</font></b><br/>
                    By Sharon Berger </p>
<p><br/>
                    JERUSALEM (April 20) - The Delek Group and Starbucks Coffee 
                    International, a wholly owned subsidiary of Starbucks Coffee 
                    Company, said yesterday that they had reached an agreement 
                    to form a joint venture to open Starbucks here. The costs 
                    involved in the joint venture were not disclosed. </p>
<p>According to the agreement, which is expected to be signed 
                    in the next few weeks, Delek will hold 80.5 percent of the 
                    coffee chain, while Starbucks Coffee International will hold 
                    the remaining 19.5%. Starbucks will have the option to increase 
                    its share to 50% at a later date. Originally Delek and Burger 
                    King co-owner Yair Hason were negotiating for a 40% share 
                    each in a venture with Starbucks, but a few months ago the 
                    deal was cancelled. </p>
<p>The announcement that Starbucks will be coming is expected 
                    to be welcomed by local coffee lovers who have long been awaiting 
                    the rumored arrival of the chain which has with 3,600 stores 
                    in the US. According to the Delek Group the plan is "to 
                    open dozens of stores." The first stores are expected 
                    to open late this year. </p>
<p>"We expect Israel to be an excellent market for Starbucks, 
                    with great growth opportunities," said Peter Masien, 
                    president of Starbucks Coffee International. </p>
<p>Delek's investment in the coffee chain is part of its strategy 
                    to expand into new areas, said Giora Sarig, president of Delek's 
                    Israel Fuel Corporation, one of the three subsidiaries of 
                    the Delek Group. "We are delighted to become partners 
                    with such a world-class brand as Starbucks," he said. 
                  </p>
<p>The coffee shops will not be connected to the Delek gas stations. 
                  </p>
<p>The local competition is not overly concerned about the entrance 
                    of the well known chain. Aroma's operating manager Ben Balbinder 
                    told The Jerusalem Post that "more coffee stores will 
                    raise the awareness of coffee drinking." </p>
<p>He added that according to his personal experience in the 
                    US, Starbucks coffee is not on the same level as that of Aroma. 
                  </p>
<p>Aroma, which sells one and half tonnes of coffee a month, 
                    currently has eight cafes with another three are to be opened 
                    in the next two months. Balbinder said that the local coffee 
                    market is continuing to grow and has contributed to a decision 
                    to expand aggressively in the next year and a half. </p>
<p>Starbucks , which has been traded on Nasdaq since 1992, has 
                    a current market capitalization of $7.8 billion, with more 
                    than 4,500 retail locations in the US, Europe, the Middle 
                    East, and the Pacific Rim. It is well represented in the Middle 
                    East with stores in Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Lebanon, 
                    Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates. </p>
<p>The company was founded in 1971 and also sells tea, pastries, 
                    ice creams, other food and beverages, and coffee accessories. 
                    The company also has an on-line store as well as selling directly 
                    to restaurants, businesses, airlines, and hotels. </p>
<p>The Delek Group, which was founded in 1951, has three major 
                    subsidiaries: Israel Fuel Corporation, Delek Real Estate,

<p>Two "Standard replies" activists are receiving 
                    from Starbucks when they complaint about the recent speech 
                    Howard Schultz made:</p>
<p><b>First:</b></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thank you for contacting Starbucks Coffee Company.</p>
<p> Howard Schultz recently spoke at his local synagogue and 
                      shared his concern over the rise of anti-Semitism, which 
                      is linked to the growing crisis in the Middle East. Howard's 
                      position is pro-peace and for two nations to co-exist peacefully. 
                      His comments were not intended to be anti-Palestinian in 
                      any way. As part of his comments, Howard addressed the rising 
                      concern over terrorist acts overseas, specifically relating 
                      to the bombing of a synagogue in France. Howard does not 
                      believe the terrorism is representative of the Palestinian 
                      people. Howard was speaking as a private citizen and did 
                      not interview with the media regarding this subject, however 
                      several local media outlets did run portions of his speech. 
                    </p>
<p>Thank you again for contacting Starbucks. If you have any 
                      further questions or concerns, please contact us at info@starbucks.com

<p>Please find below the company statement regarding Howard 
                      Schultz's speech on April 4, 2002.  It is followed 
                      by Howard Schultz's personal statement in which he is speaking

<p>Starbucks Coffee Company is deeply saddened by the current 
                      events in the Middle East. </p>
<p>As a company working with business partners around the 
                      world, we believe it is important for us to embrace diversity

                      treat each other with respect and dignity. Starbucks, as 
                      a commercial organization, does not get involved in international 
                      or local <br/>
                      politics on principle.</p>
<p>We are aware that our chairman, Howard Schultz, recently 
                      spoke at a private gathering and commented on the current 
                      Middle East situation. However, we are unable to comment 
                      on his speech as he was speaking as a private citizen.</p>
<p>
</p><p> </p>
<p>April 17, 2002 - Howard Schultz Personal Statement </p>
<p> </p>
<p>"I deeply regret that my speech in Seattle was misinterpreted 
                      to be anti-Palestinian," said Howard Schultz.  
                      "My position has always been pro-peace and for the 
                      two nations to co-exist peacefully.  I am deeply saddened 
                      by the current events in the Middle East."</p>

                    234.5 mm. The acquisition consists of 198 Mapco Express filling

                    for $ 147 mm and 36 East Coast convenience store-gas stations

<p>All
six Starbucks cafes in Israel will be shut down at the end of the week,
Starbucks Coffee International and the Delek Group said as they
announced the end of their brief partnership. All 120 of the coffee
chain's employees in Israel will be laid off. </p>
<p>According
to Israel's Haaretz.com, poor sales and Delek's failure to find an
investor to bail it out of a losing venture caused the decision to shut
down the expensive coffeehouses. Starbucks Corp., the parent of
Starbucks Coffee International, told Haaretz that its decision to
dissolve the joint venture was driven by "market challenges," an
allusion, the newspaper said, to "Israel's severe recession and
security problems."</p>

<p> Bowl 4 Israel <br/>
      Bowl-A-Thon 2002 &amp; Bowl-A-Thon 2003 (9 Nov, 2003)</p>
<p>
Starbucks sponsers "bowl 4 israel", one of the fund raisers for Israel
organised by Elie Haller. Her last fund raiser was a barbeque that
"raised $15,000 for a paratrooper unit in the Israel Defense
Forces".[a] This time the money raised - some $50,000 was to be
distributed to families of "Israeli terror victims" by the Israel
Emergency Solidarity Fund (OneFamily).[a] [d] Innocent enough you may
think, but you'd be wrong - apparently their definition of "terror
victim" includes israeli soldiers who were killed whilst they were
butchering Palestinian women and children during the Jenin massacre
(April 2002). For April 2002, their spending record includes the
following entry:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"P.
W. lost his brother S. in an anti-terror operation in Jenin April 8,
2002. The family is left with eight children, of whom P. is the first
to get married. OneFamily (Israel Emergency Solidarity Fund) gave them
$1000 toward the wedding."[c] </p>
</blockquote>
<p>So the fund rewards the families of war criminals for a job well done!</p>

<p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">ADL vouches for Starbucks zionist credentials</font></b></p>
<p>
After Starbucks closed down its cafes in Israel[14], many zionists were
upset and accused Starbucks of succumbing to the boycott. Some even
suggested boycotting Starbucks:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It
is time for all Americans to boycott Starbucks Coffee. Spread the word
on this. They are stopping business relations with Israel, because like
so many companies, people, and leaders in the world, they do not have
the moral values or courage needed to do otherwise. Add this to the
fact that Starbucks does tons of business in Lebanon, Saudi Arabia,
Qatar, as well as other radical Arab countries who are working to
destroy America. Where they will not pull out of and it makes it clear
their stand is with the enemies of Israel and of America. Standing is
something that takes moral value and courage today.And their stand
indicates the lack of quality of their product. Starbucks has chosen.
NOW is the time for us to choose to boycott. Let's call on everyone we
can to boycott Starbucks.. [a] </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Its
interesting to observe that it was the ultra-zionist Anti-Defamation
League (ADL) that came to Starbucks rescue[b] and put down the zionist
backlash against it. (For those unaware of the activities of the ADL
see <a href="boycott-news-0313.html">http://www.inminds.co.uk/boycott-news-0313.html</a> ). As the New York Times put it: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Perhaps
the most effective of the company's weapons used to combat the rumor,
experts said, came from the Anti-Defamation League, which lent its
support. Starbucks, which is based in Seattle, did not place any
messages refuting the rumor on its Web site. But the Anti-Defamation
League contacted the company to investigate the matter and later
circulated the company's message to interested parties on its Web site
and in telephone calls.” </p>
</blockquote>
<p>It
also quoted Starbuck chairman Howard Shultz, describing him as "a
Jewish American who has long been supportive of Jewish organizations
and causes in the United States and in Israel", saying that the company
will return to Israel in due course.[a] </p>
<p>See also [17] for another zionist defence of Starbucks.</p>
<p>Many other zionist groups also came to Starbucks defence including the Jewish Council for Public Affairs whose alert[d] states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p> "The chairman of Starbucks is an avid Zionist who opened the stores in Israel despite the ongoing violence.


 Coffee is serious business in Israel, and Starbucks was unable to penetrate the market."</p>

<p>NB:
Boycott Watch is a zionist organisation[a] which provides the above
photos as part of their campaign to support Starbucks from any possible
zionist boycott for closing its stores in Israel.</p>

                    leading the fight against divestment and boycott campaigns against<br/>
                    Israel." </p>

<p> </p> <p>Also according to the American Forces Press Service Nov.9 2004:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Starbucks
Chief Executive Officer Jim Donald said during a Capitol Hill press
conference today in the office of U.S. Rep. Norm Dicks that his company
would provide 50,000 pounds of free, whole-bean coffee that will be
brewed and distributed by Red Cross workers to troops serving in
Kuwait, Afghanistan and Iraq. </p>
<p>"It's
important that we show the support – and we have shown support -- for
our troops overseas," Donald explained. In fact, he said, Starbucks,
headquartered in Seattle, has 80 employees in the military now deployed
in Iraq and Afghanistan. </p>
<p>And many of
Starbuck's 85,000 employees, Donald pointed out, have friends and
family members serving overseas in the military. Starbuck's partnership
with the Red Cross, he noted, "is just a way of reaching into the
community and supporting troops from all over the U.S."</p>
