<font color="#000000" face="verdana, helvetica" size="-1">
For <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20000817182630/http://www.eonline.com/News/Items/0,1,1852,00.html">Jenny McCarthy</a> fans, it was a strange invitation too good to piss away--a chance to own a pint of the bombshell-comic's liquid waste. At least, that's the gist of a press release that was sent to McCarthy's network (NBC), her sponsor (Candie's shoes) and other strategic Jenny locals.
    </font></p><p><font color="#000000" face="verdana, helvetica" size="-1">
    It came addressed from a company called GCS Productions and listed a guy named Stoidi Puekaw as the contact. If you liked the shoe ad featuring the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/web/20000817182630/http://www.eonline.com/Reviews/Tube/Grid/Shows/jenny.html"><i>Jenny</i></a> star sitting on the can with her panties around her Candie's, the release reads, you'll definitely want this gag gift that promises to be bigger than the Pet Rock. For $19.95, "Jenny's Pint o' Pee" is yours.
    </font></p><p><font color="#000000" face="verdana, helvetica" size="-1">
    Of course, Jenny's lawyer was left with a burning sensation, and quickly fired off a cease-and-desist letter to CEO Puekaw, warning him to dispose of the 500,000 cases of gift-wrapped product he claimed was stored in Mexico, awaiting the thirsty holiday rush. 
    </font></p><p><font color="#000000" face="verdana, helvetica" size="-1">
    Surprise! GCS stands for "Good Comedy Satire." Stoidi Puekaw spelled backwards reads "Wake up idiots." And "Jenny's Pint o' Pee" is not really a product. Turns out Jenny and her people got had by <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20000817182630/http://www.eonline.com/Facts/People/0,12,20938,00.html">Alan Abel</a>--a professional hoaxster, founder of the "Omar School for Beggars"  (a fictitious pan-handler college) and the Society for Indecency to Naked Animals. A living 67-year-old Connecticut man who once got <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20000817182630/http://www.sybercity.com/abelobit.html"><i>The New York Times</i></a> to run his obituary.
    </font></p><p><font color="#000000" face="verdana, helvetica" size="-1">
    Abel simply felt McCarthy had gotten a little too tasteless for his liking with <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20000817182630/http://www.eonline.com/News/Items/0,1,1601,00.html">her Candies ad</a>. "I like Jenny very much," he says. "Now that Pamela Lee's retired to life with Tommy and the baby, we need somebody new. I just think she stepped over the line a little when she stepped on the can."
    </font></p><p><font color="#000000" face="verdana, helvetica" size="-1">
    So, with the help of writing partner Ron Kershman, Abel--who's next "product" will be a paperweight called the "Ellen Dildo"--printed out 50 press releases and sent them to the right places. "You get people working around email and fax machines, and it spreads like wildfire," he explains.
    </font></p><p><font color="#000000" face="verdana, helvetica" size="-1">
    McCarthy's Los Angeles-based attorney, Larry Stein--who originally construed Abel's actions as a genuine trademark infringement--is not amused. "Too many people need my resources who have real problems," he says. "I usually shoot off a [cease-and-desist] letter like [the one he sent Abel] once a week or so, but this is the first time it's been a hoax. Still, anytime someone threatens to violate someone else's rights, it's serious."
    </font></p><p><font color="#000000" face="verdana, helvetica" size="-1">
    Now that the hoax has been uncovered, both parties think the issue will probably flush itself away. Still, Abel had a trademark defense at the ready. "We weren't selling Jenny McCarthy's pee," he explains. "It comes from Jenny Hernandez in the Bronx."
    </font></p><p><font color="#000000" face="verdana, helvetica" size="-1">
    And Abel can understand why the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20000817182630/http://www.eonline.com/News/Items/0,1,1200,00.html">former <i>Playboy</i> pin-up</a> might be offended--sort of: "I'm sure her network and her associates don't want her to seem rude, even though she may belch on TV."</font>
