Barrister uncovers root of national schizophrenia

</b></p><p><b>

People born in the USA have dual citizenship

</b></p><p><b>

By Don Harkins

</b></p><p><b>

SPOKANE, Wash.</b> -- Florida Barrister Austin Gary Cooper
of Taking Back America (TBA) presented what appears to be a
flawless line of logic to nearly 150 people at the Ramada
near the airport here November 7, 2001. Cooper provided
convincing evidence that suggests all persons born in the
United States have dual citizenship: American and U.S. --
one by birth and the other by contract.

</p><p>

“American Citizens are to abide six laws; U.S.
citizens are subject to 60 million statutes,” Cooper
explained and then added, “What would you rather do --
obey six laws or try to obey 60 million statutes?

</p><p>

According to Cooper, the dividing line came with the
ratification of the 14th Amendment in 1868. Until that time
Americans were sovereign state Citizens under the
Constitution. Upon passage of the 14th Amendment, we closed
the southern plantation and freed the Negro slaves; opened
the federal plantation, created U.S. citizens -- all of
whom are slaves.

</p><p>

 What Cooper uncovered to prove that we are
 born with dual citizenship is that a little known law was
 passed by the 40th Congress July 27, 1868 -- the day
 before the 14th Amendment was ratified.

</p><p>
<i>“An Act concerning the Rights of American Citizens
 in foreign States...Be it enacted by the Senate and the
 House of Representatives of the United States of America
 in Congress assembled, that any declaration, instruction,
 order or decision of any Officers of this government which
 denies, restricts, impairs or questions the right of
 expatriation, is hereby declared inconsistent with the
 fundamental principles of this government.” </i><b>
 ~United States Statutes at Large, Volume 15, Chapter 249,
 page 223, 40th Congress.</b>
</p><p>

 Cooper then explains the concept of foreign states. Under
 the definition, the United States is the proper name for
 the federal government and its territories and possessions
 and is, therefore, a state foreign to a person born into
 American citizenship. “The 40th Congress, knowing
 what was coming the following day, gave us the ability to
 expatriate ourselves from the U.S. side, and repatriate
 ourselves back into the American side.

</p><p>

 As an American Citizen, “the law gives you all the
 power in the world to do anything you want so long as you
 don't injure a person or his property, or take the rights
 of others,” Cooper explained.

</p><p>

 “As a U.S. citizen, you are a possession of the
 United States government and therefore are subject to its
 60 million statutes.”

</p><p>

 The goal of TBA is to teach Americans the fundamentals of
 citizenship and the difference between laws and statutes:
 “Laws are given to us by God and are described in
 English Common Law; statutes are abrogations of law,”
 said Cooper who added that Congress was authorized by the
 Constitution to make laws, not pass statutes which are
 actually bylaws for the corporation that U.S. citizens
 must obey.

</p><p>

 Cooper has a lot of disdain for attorneys and the Bar
 association which he believes is running  the government
 of this country. He also commented that BAR is an acronym
 for British Accredited Registry. A look at Cooper's
 documentation would support his claim that all attorneys
 are guilty of treason. “They are officers of the
 court first; government agents next. Their job is take
 from you and give to the crown,” Cooper said.

</p><p>
<b> Note: </b><i>There are a lot of “programs”
 out there with regard to this subject matter. Most of them
 require quantum leaps in logic to accept as valid. This is
 the first time I have ever heard anyone mention the
 expatriation/repatriation act of the 40th Congress. The
 rest of Cooper's material fits with other research to
 which I have been exposed.

 status as people living in this bizarre time, I suggest
