<a name="bookmark01"></a> <h3>General Information</h3>
<h4>Description</h4>
<p>Formaldehyde is a nearly colorless gas 
                    with a pungent, irritating odor even at very low concentrations 
                    (below 1 ppm). Its vapors are flammable and explosive. Because 
                    the pure gas tends to polymerize, it is commonly used and 
                    stored in solution. Formalin, the aqueous solution of formaldehyde 
                    (30% to 50% formaldehyde), typically contains up to 15% methanol 
                    as a stabilizer.</p>
<h4>Routes of Exposure</h4>
<h5>Inhalation</h5>
<p>Most formaldehyde exposures occur by 
                    inhalation or by skin/eye contact. Formaldehyde vapor is readily 
                    absorbed from the lungs. In cases of acute exposure, formaldehyde 
                    will most likely be detected by smell; however, persons who 
                    are sensitized to formaldehyde may experience headaches and 
                    minor eye and airway irritation at levels below the odor threshold 
                    (odor threshold is 0.5 to 1.0 ppm; OSHA PEL is 0.75 ppm). 
                    <b>For sensitized persons, odor is not an adequate indicator 
                    of formaldehyde's presence and may not provide reliable warning 
                    of hazardous concentrations. Odor adaptation can occur</b>. 
                    Low-dose acute exposure can result in headache, rhinitis, 
                    and dyspnea; higher doses may cause severe mucous membrane 
                    irritation, burning, and lacrimation, and lower respiratory 
                    effects such as bronchitis, pulmonary edema, or pneumonia. 
                    Sensitive individuals may experience asthma and dermatitis, 
                    even at very low doses. Formaldehyde vapors are slightly heavier 
                    than air and can result in asphyxiation in poorly ventilated, 
                    enclosed, or low-lying areas.</p>
<p> Children exposed to the same levels 
                    of formaldehyde as adults may receive larger doses because 
                    they have greater lung surface area:body weight ratios and 
                    increased minute volumes:weight ratios. In addition, they 
                    may be exposed to higher levels than adults in the same location 
                    because of their short stature and the higher levels of formaldehyde 
                    found nearer to the ground. </p>
<h5>Skin/Eye Contact</h5>
<p>Ocular exposure to formaldehyde vapors 
                    produces irritation and lacrimation. Depending on the concentration, 
                    formaldehyde solutions may cause transient discomfort and 
                    irritation or more severe effects, including corneal opacification 
                    and loss of vision. Formaldehyde is absorbed through intact 
                    skin and may cause irritation or allergic dermatitis; rapid 
                    metabolism makes systemic effects unlikely following dermal 
                    exposure.</p>
<p> Children are more vulnerable to toxicants 
                    absorbed through the skin because of their relatively larger 
                    surface area:body weight ratio.</p>
<h5>Ingestion</h5>
<p>Ingestion of as little as 30 mL (1 oz.) 
                    of a solution containing 37% formaldehyde has been reported 
                    to cause death in an adult. Ingestion may cause corrosive 
                    injury to the gastrointestinal mucosa, with nausea, vomiting, 
                    pain, bleeding, and perforation. Corrosive injuries are usually 
                    most pronounced in the pharyngeal mucosa, epiglottis and esophagus. 
                    Systemic effects include metabolic acidosis, CNS depression 
                    and coma, respiratory distress, and renal failure.</p>
<h4>Sources/Uses</h4>
<p>Formaldehyde is synthesized by the oxidation 
                    of methanol. It is among the 25 most abundantly produced chemicals 
                    in the world and is used in the manufacture of plastics, resins, 
                    and urea-formaldehyde foam insulation. Formaldehyde or formaldehyde-containing 
                    resins are used in the manufacture of chelating agents, a 
                    wide variety of organic products, glass mirrors, explosives, 
                    artificial silk, and dyes. It has been used as a disinfectant, 
                    germicide, and in embalming fluid. In the agricultural industry, 
                    formaldehyde has been used as a fumigant, preventative for 
                    mildew in wheat and rot in oats, a germicide and fungicide 
                    for plants, an insecticide, and in the manufacture of slow-release 
                    fertilizers. Formaldehyde is found in construction materials 
                    such as plywood adhesives. Formaldehyde also is or has been 
                    used in the sugar, rubber, food, petroleum, pharmaceuticals, 
                    and textiles industries. </p>
<h4>Standards and Guidelines</h4>
<p>OSHA PEL (permissible exposure limit) 
                    = 0.75 ppm (averaged over an 8-hour workshift)</p>
<p>OSHA STEL (short-term exposure limit) 
                    = 2 ppm (15 minute exposure)</p>
<p>NIOSH IDLH (immediately dangerous to

                    for up to 1 hour without experiencing or developing irreversible 
                    or other serious health effects or symptoms which could impair 
                    an individual's ability to take protective action) = 10 ppm</p>
<h4>Physical Properties</h4>
<p><i>Description</i>: Nearly colorless 
                    gas with a pungent, irritating odor</p>
<p><i>Warning properties</i>: Odor is detectable 
                    at less than 1 ppm, but many sensitive persons experience 
                    symptoms below the odor threshold.</p>

<h4>Incompatibilities</h4>
<p>Formaldehyde reacts with strong oxidizers, 
                    alkalis, acids, phenols, and urea. Pure formaldehyde has a 
                    tendency to polymerize.</p>

<a name="bookmark02"></a><h3>Health Effects</h3>
<ul>
<li>Formaldehyde is an eye, skin, and respiratory tract irritant. 
                      Inhalation of vapors can produce narrowing of the bronchi 
                      and an accumulation of fluid in the lungs.</li>
<li> Children may be more susceptible than adults to the respiratory 
                      effects of formaldehyde.</li>
<li> Formaldehyde solution (formalin) causes corrosive injury 
                      to the gastrointestinal tract, especially the pharynx, epiglottis, 
                      esophagus, and stomach.</li>
<li>The systemic effects of formaldehyde are due primarily 
                      to its metabolic conversion to formate, and may include 
                      metabolic acidosis, circulatory shock, respiratory insufficiency, 
                      and acute renal failure.</li>
<li>Formaldehyde is a potent sensitizer and a probable human 
                      carcinogen.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Acute Exposure</h4>
<p>Formaldehyde vapor produces immediate 
                    local irritation in mucous membranes, including eyes, nose, 
                    and upper respiratory tract. Ingestion of formalin causes 
                    severe injury to the gastrointestinal tract. The exact mechanism 
                    of action of formaldehyde toxicity is not clear, but it is 
                    known that it can interact with molecules on cell membranes 
                    and in body tissues and fluids (e.g., proteins and DNA) and 
                    disrupt cellular functions. High concentrations cause precipitation 
                    of proteins, which results in cell death. Absorption from 
                    the respiratory tract is very rapid; absorption from the gastrointestinal 
                    tract is also rapid, but may be delayed by ingestion with 
                    food. Once absorbed, formaldehyde is metabolized to formic 
                    acid, which may cause acid-base imbalance and a number of 
                    other systemic effects.</p>
<p> Children do not always respond to chemicals 
                    in the same way that adults do. Different protocols for managing 
                    their care may be needed.</p>
<h5>CNS</h5>
<p>Malaise, headache, sleeping disturbances, 
                    irritability, and impairment of dexterity, memory, and equilibrium 
                    may result from a single, high level, exposure to formaldehyde.</p>
<h5>Respiratory</h5>
<p>Even fairly low concentrations of formaldehyde 
                    can produce rapid onset of nose and throat irritation, causing 
                    cough, chest pain, shortness of breath, and wheezing. Higher 
                    exposures can cause significant inflammation of the lower 
                    respiratory tract, resulting in swelling of the throat, inflammation 
                    of the windpipe and bronchi, narrowing of the bronchi, inflammation 
                    of the lungs, and accumulation of fluid in the lungs. Pulmonary 
                    injury may continue to worsen for 12 hours or more after exposure.</p>
<p>Previously sensitized individuals can 
                    develop severe narrowing of the bronchi at very low concentrations 
                    (e.g., 0.3 ppm). Bronchial narrowing may begin immediately 
                    or can be delayed for 3 to 4 hours; effects may worsen for 
                    up to 20 hours after exposure and can persist for several 
                    days.</p>
<p> Exposure to certain chemical irritants 
                    can lead to Reactive Airway Dysfunction Syndrome (RADS), a 
                    chemically- or irritant-induced type of asthma.</p>
<p> Children may be more vulnerable to corrosive 
                    agents than adults because of the relatively smaller diameter 
                    of their airways.</p>
<p> Children may be more vulnerable because 
                    of relatively increased minute ventilation per kg and failure 
                    to evacuate an area promptly when exposed.</p>
<h5>Metabolic</h5>
<p>Accumulation of formic acid can cause 
                    an anion-gap acid-base imbalance. If formalin is ingested, 
                    absorption of the methanol stabilizer may contribute to the 
                    imbalance and can result in an osmolal gap, as well as an 
                    anion gap.</p>
<h5>Immunologic</h5>
<p>In persons who have been previously sensitized, 
                    inhalation and skin contact may cause various skin disorders, 
                    asthma-like symptoms, anaphylactic reactions and, rarely, 
                    hemolysis. The immune system in children continues to develop 
                    after birth, and thus, children may be more susceptible to 
                    certain chemicals.</p>
<h5>Gastrointestinal</h5>
<p>Ingestion of aqueous solutions of formaldehyde 
                    can result in severe corrosive injury to the esophagus and 
                    stomach. Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, inflammation 
                    of the stomach, and ulceration and perforation of the oropharynx, 
                    epiglottis, esophagus, and stomach may occur. Both formaldehyde 
                    and the methanol stabilizer are easily absorbed and can contribute 
                    to systemic toxicity.</p>
<h5>Ocular</h5>
<p>Exposure to low concentrations of formaldehyde 
                    vapor can cause eye irritation, which abates within minutes 
                    after exposure has ended. Formalin splashed in the eyes can 
                    result in corneal ulceration or cloudiness of the eye surface, 
                    death of eye surface cells, perforation, and permanent loss 
                    of vision; these effects may be delayed for 12 hours or more.</p>
<h5>Dermal</h5>
<p>Exposure to formaldehyde vapor or to 
                    formalin solutions can cause skin irritation and burns. In 
                    sensitized persons, contact dermatitis may develop at very 
                    low exposure levels.</p>
<h5>Potential Sequelae</h5>
<p>In survivors of inhalation injury, pulmonary 
                    function usually returns to normal. Eye exposure to high concentrations 
                    of formaldehyde vapor or formalin can eventually cause blindness. 
                    Narrowing of the esophagus and severe corrosive damage to 
                    the stomach lining can result from ingesting formalin.</p>
<h3>Chronic Exposure</h3>
<p>The major concerns of repeated formaldehyde 
                    exposure are sensitization and cancer. In sensitized persons, 
                    formaldehyde can cause asthma and contact dermatitis. In persons 
                    who are not sensitized, prolonged inhalation of formaldehyde 
                    at low levels is unlikely to result in chronic pulmonary injury. 
                    Adverse effects on the central nervous system such as increased 
                    prevalence of headache, depression, mood changes, insomnia, 
                    irritability, attention deficit, and impairment of dexterity, 
                    memory, and equilibrium have been reported to result from 
                    long-term exposure. Chronic exposure may be more serious for 
                    children because of their potential longer latency period.</p>
<h4>Carcinogenicity</h4>
<p>The Department of Health and Human Services 
                    has determined that formaldehyde may reasonably be anticipated 
                    to be a carcinogen. In humans, formaldehyde exposure has been 
                    weakly associated with increased risk of nasal cancer and 
                    nasal tumors were observed in rats chronically inhaling formaldehyde.</p>
<h4>Reproductive and Developmental Effects</h4>
<p>There is limited evidence that formaldehyde 
                    causes adverse reproductive effects. The TERIS database states 
                    that the risk of developmental defects to the exposed fetus 
                    ranges from none to minimal. Formaldehyde is not included 
                    in <i>Reproductive and Developmental Toxicants</i>, a 1991 
                    report published by the U.S. General Accounting Office (GAO) 
                    that lists 30 chemicals widely acknowledged to have reproductive 
                    and developmental consequences.</p>
<p> There have been reports of menstrual 
                    disorders in women occupationally exposed to formaldehyde, 
                    but they are controversial. Studies in experimental animals 
                    have reported some effects on spermatogenesis. Formaldehyde 
                    has not been proven to be teratogenic in animals and is probably 
                    not a human teratogen at occupationally permissible levels. 
                    Formaldehyde has been shown to have genotoxic properties in 
                    human and laboratory animal studies producing sister chromatid 
                    exchange and chromosomal aberrations.</p>
<p> Special consideration regarding the 
                    exposure of pregnant women is warranted, since formaldehyde 
                    has been shown to be a genotoxin; thus, medical counseling 
                    is recommended for the acutely exposed pregnant woman.</p>

<a name="bookmark03"></a> <h3>Prehospital Management</h3>
<ul>
<li>Victims exposed only to formaldehyde gas do not pose significant 
                      risks of secondary contamination to personnel outside the 
                      Hot Zone. Victims whose clothing or skin is contaminated 
                      with a formaldehyde-containing solution (formalin) can secondarily 
                      contaminate personnel by direct contact or through off-gassing 
                      vapor.</li>
<li>Inhalation of formaldehyde can cause airway irritation, 
                      bronchospasm, and pulmonary edema.</li>
<li>Absorption of large amounts of formaldehyde via any route 
                      can cause severe systemic toxicity, leading to metabolic 
                      acidosis, tissue and organ damage, and coma.</li>
<li>There is no antidote for formaldehyde. Treatment consists 
                      of supportive measures including decontamination (flushing 
                      of skin and eyes with water, gastric lavage, and administration 
                      of activated charcoal), administration of supplemental oxygen, 
                      intravenous sodium bicarbonate and/or isotonic fluid, and 
                      hemodialysis.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Hot Zone</h4>
<p>Rescuers should be trained and appropriately 
                    attired before entering the Hot Zone. If the proper equipment 
                    is not available, or if rescuers have not been trained in 
                    its use, assistance should be obtained from a local or regional 
                    HAZMAT team or other properly equipped response organization.</p>
<h5>Rescuer Protection</h5>
<p>Formaldehyde is a highly toxic systemic 
                    poison that is absorbed well by inhalation. The vapor is a 
                    severe respiratory tract and skin irritant and may cause dizziness 
                    or suffocation. Contact with formaldehyde solution may cause 
                    severe burns to the eyes and skin. </p>
<p><i>Respiratory Protection</i>: Positive-pressure, 
                    self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) is recommended in 
                    response situations that involve exposure to potentially unsafe 
                    levels of formaldehyde vapor.</p>
<p><i>Skin Protection</i>: Chemical-protective 
                    clothing is recommended because formaldehyde can cause skin 
                    irritation and burns.</p>
<h5>ABC Reminders</h5>
<p>Quickly access for a patent airway, ensure 
                    adequate respiration and pulse. If trauma is suspected, maintain 
                    cervical immobilization manually and apply a cervical collar 
                    and a backboard when feasible.</p>
<h5>Victim Removal</h5>
<p>If victims can walk, lead them out of 
                    the Hot Zone to the Decontamination Zone. Victims who are 
                    unable to walk may be removed on backboards or gurneys; if 
                    these are not available, carefully carry or drag victims to 
                    safety.</p>
<p> Consider appropriate management of chemically 
                    contaminated children, such as measures to reduce separation 
                    anxiety if a child is separated from a parent or other adult. 
                  </p>
<h4>Decontamination Zone</h4>
<p>Victims exposed only to formaldehyde 
                    vapor who have no skin or eye irritation may be transferred 
                    immediately to the Support Zone. All others require decontamination 
                    (see <i>Basic Decontamination</i> below).</p>
<p><b>Rescuer Protection</b></p>
<p>If exposure levels are determined to 
                    be safe, decontamination may be conducted by personnel wearing 
                    a lower level of protection than that worn in the Hot Zone 
                    (described above).</p>
<h5>ABC Reminders</h5>
<p>Quickly access for a patent airway, ensure 
                    adequate respiration and pulse. Stabilize the cervical spine 
                    with a collar if trauma is suspected. Administer supplemental 
                    oxygen as required. Assist ventilation with a bag-valve-mask 
                    device if necessary.</p>
<h5>Basic Decontamination</h5>
<p>Victims who are able may assist with 
                    their own decontamination. Remove and double-bag contaminated 
                    clothing and personal belongings.</p>
<p>Flush liquid-exposed skin and hair with 
                    plain water for 3 to 5 minutes. Wash area thoroughly with 
                    soap and water when possible. Use caution to avoid hypothermia 
                    when decontaminating children or the elderly. Use blankets 
                    or warmers when appropriate.</p>
<p>Irrigate exposed or irritated eyes with 
                    plain water or saline for 15 minutes. Remove contact lenses 
                    if easily removable without additional trauma to the eye. 
                    If pain or injury is evident, continue eye irrigation while 
                    transferring the victim to the Support Zone.</p>
<p>In cases of formalin ingestion, <b>do 
                    not induce emesis</b>. Victims who are conscious and able 
                    to swallow should be given 4 to 8 ounces of water or milk. 
                    Gastric lavage with a small bore NG tube should be considered 
                    if it can be performed within 1 hour after ingestion. The 
                    effectiveness of activated charcoal administration is unknown, 
                    but it is suggested following lavage (administer activated 
                    charcoal at 1 gm/kg, usual adult dose 60-90 g, child dose 
                    25-50 g). A soda can and straw may be of assistance when offering 
                    charcoal to a child.</p>
<p> Consider appropriate management of chemically 
                    contaminated children at the exposure site. Also, provide 
                    reassurance to the child during decontamination, especially 
                    if separation from a parent occurs. If possible, seek assistance 
                    from a child separation expert.</p>
<h5>Transfer to Support Zone</h5>
<p>As soon as basic decontamination is complete, 
                    move the victim to the Support Zone.</p>
<h5>Support Zone</h5>
<p>Be certain that victims have been decontaminated 
                    properly (see <i>Decontamination Zone</i> above). Persons 
                    who have undergone decontamination or who have been exposed 
                    only to vapor pose no serious risks of secondary contamination. 
                    Support Zone personnel require no specialized protective gear 
                    in such cases.</p>
<h5>ABC Reminders</h5>
<p>Quickly access for a patent airway. If 
                    trauma is suspected, maintain cervical immobilization manually 
                    and apply a cervical collar and a backboard when feasible. 
                    Ensure adequate respiration and pulse. Administer supplemental 
                    oxygen as required and establish intravenous access if necessary. 
                    Place on a cardiac monitor. Watch for signs of airway swelling 
                    and obstruction such as progressive hoarseness, stridor, or 
                    cyanosis.</p>
<h5>Additional Decontamination</h5>
<p>Continue irrigating exposed skin and 
                    eyes, as appropriate. </p>
<p>In cases of formalin ingestion, <b>do 
                    not induce emesis</b>. If water has not been given previously, 
                    administer 4 to 8 ounces of milk or water if the patient is 
                    able to swallow.</p>
<h5>Advanced Treatment</h5>
<p>In cases of respiratory compromise secure 
                    airway and respiration via endotracheal intubation. If not 
                    possible, perform cricothyroidotomy if equipped and trained 
                    to do so.</p>
<p> Treat patients who have bronchospasm 
                    with aerosolized bronchodilators. The use of bronchial sensitizing 
                    agents in situations of multiple chemical exposures may pose 
                    additional risks. Consider the health of the myocardium before 
                    choosing which type of bronchodilator should be administered. 
                    Cardiac sensitizing agents may be appropriate; however, the 
                    use of cardiac sensitizing agents after exposure to certain 
                    chemicals may pose enhanced risk of cardiac arrhythmias (especially 
                    in the elderly). Formaldehyde poisoning is not known to pose 
                    additional risk during the use of bronchial or cardiac sensitizing 
                    agents. </p>
<p> Consider racemic epinephrine aerosol 
                    for children who develop stridor. Dose 0.25-0.75 mL of 2.25% 
                    racemic epinephrine solution in 2.5 cc water, repeat every 
                    20 minutes as needed, cautioning for myocardial variability. 
                  </p>
<p> Patients who are comatose, hypotensive, 
                    or have seizures or cardiac dysrhythmias should be treated 
                    according to advanced life support (ALS) protocols. Treat 
                    acidosis with intravenous sodium bicarbonate (adult dose = 
                    1 ampule; pediatric dose = 1 Eq/kg). Further bicarbonate therapy 
                    should be guided by arterial blood gas (ABG) measurements. 
                    Hemodialysis should be considered in patients with severe 
                    acid-base disturbances that are refractory to conventional 
                    therapy or in cases with significant methanol levels. </p>
<p> If evidence of shock or hypotension 
                    is observed begin fluid administration. For adults, bolus 
                    1,000 mL/hour intravenous saline or lactated Ringer's solution 
                    if blood pressure is under 80 mm Hg; if systolic pressure 
                    is over 90 mm Hg, an infusion rate of 150 to 200 mL/hour is 
                    sufficient. For children with compromised perfusion administer 
                    a 20 mL/kg bolus of normal saline over 10 to 20 minutes, then 
                    infuse at 2 to 3 mL/kg/hour. Follow with administration of 
                    dopamine (2 to 20 μg/kg/min) or norepinephrine (0.1 to 
                    0.2 μg/kg/min), if necessary.</p>
<h5>Transport to Medical Facility</h5>
<p>Only decontaminated patients or patients 
                    not requiring decontamination should be transported to a medical 
                    facility. "Body bags" are not recommended.</p>
<p> Report to the base station and the receiving 
                    medical facility the condition of the patient, treatment given, 
                    and estimated time of arrival at the medical facility.</p>
<p>If formaldehyde has been ingested, prepare 
                    the ambulance in case the victim vomits toxic material. Have 
                    ready several towels and open plastic bags to quickly clean 
                    up and isolate vomitus.</p>
<h4>Multi-Casualty Triage</h4>
<p>If possible, consult with the base station 
                    physician or the regional poison control center for advice 
                    regarding triage of multiple victims.</p>
<p>Patients who have ingested formalin or 
                    have symptoms (e.g., severe wheezing or dyspnea) or obvious 
                    injuries (e.g., skin or eye burns) should be transported immediately 
                    to a medical facility for evaluation.</p>
<p>Patients who have no eye, skin, or throat 
                    irritation, or only mild or transient symptoms may be released 
                    from the scene after their names, addresses, and telephone 
                    numbers are recorded. Those discharged should be advised to 
                    seek medical care promptly if symptoms develop (see <i>Patient 
                    Information Sheet</i> below).</p>

<a name="bookmark04"></a> <h3>Emergency Department Management</h3>
<ul>
<li>Hospital personnel in an enclosed area can be secondarily 
                      contaminated by direct contact, by vapors off-gassing from 
                      heavily soaked clothing, or from the vomitus of victims 
                      who have ingested formaldehyde. Patients do not pose serious 
                      contamination risks after contaminated clothing is removed 
                      and the skin is thoroughly washed.</li>
<li>Inhalation of formaldehyde can cause airway irritation, 
                      bronchospasm, and pulmonary edema.</li>
<li>Absorption of large amounts of formaldehyde via any route 
                      can cause severe systemic toxicity, leading to metabolic 
                      acidosis, tissue and organ damage, and coma.</li>
<li>There is no antidote for formaldehyde. Treatment consists 
                      of supportive measures including decontamination (flushing 
                      of skin and eyes with water, gastric lavage, and administration 
                      of activated charcoal), administration of supplemental oxygen, 
                      intravenous sodium bicarbonate and/or isotonic fluid, and 
                      hemodialysis.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Decontamination Area</h4>
<p>Previously decontaminated patients and 
                    patients exposed only to formaldehyde vapor who have no skin 
                    or eye irritation may be transferred immediately to the Critical 
                    Care Area. Other patients will require decontamination as 
                    described below. Because formaldehyde is absorbed (although 
                    poorly) through the skin, don butyl rubber gloves and apron 
                    before treating patients. Formaldehyde readily penetrates 
                    most rubbers and barrier fabrics or creams, but butyl rubber 
                    provides good skin protection.</p>
<p> Be aware that use of protective equipment 
                    by the provider may cause fear in children, resulting in decreased 
                    compliance with further management efforts.</p>
<p> Because of their relatively larger surface 
                    area:body weight ratio, children are more vulnerable to toxicants 
                    absorbed through the skin. Also, emergency room personnel 
                    should examine children's mouths for corrosive injury because 
                    of the frequency of hand-to-mouth activity among children.</p>
<h5>ABC Reminders</h5>
<p>Evaluate and support airway, breathing, 
                    and circulation. Children may be more vulnerable to corrosive 
                    agents than adults because of the smaller diameter of their 
                    airways. In cases of respiratory compromise secure airway 
                    and respiration via endotracheal intubation. If not possible, 
                    surgically create an airway.</p>
<p>Treat patients who have bronchospasm 
                    with aerosolized bronchodilators. The use of bronchial sensitizing 
                    agents in situations of multiple chemical exposures may pose 
                    additional risks. Consider the health of the myocardium before 
                    choosing which type of bronchodilator should be administered. 
                    Cardiac sensitizing agents may be appropriate; however, the 
                    use of cardiac sensitizing agents after exposure to certain 
                    chemicals may pose enhanced risk of cardiac arrhythmias (especially 
                    in the elderly). Formaldehyde poisoning is not known to pose 
                    additional risk during the use of bronchial or cardiac sensitizing 
                    agents. </p>
<p> Consider racemic epinephrine aerosol 
                    for children who develop stridor. Dose 0.25-0.75 mL of 2.25% 
                    racemic epinephrine solution in 2.5 cc water, repeat every 
                    20 minutes as needed, cautioning for myocardial variability.</p>
<p> Patients who are comatose, hypotensive, 
                    or have seizures or ventricular dysrhythmias should be treated 
                    in the conventional manner.</p>
<p> Correct acidosis in the patient who 
                    has coma, seizures, or cardiac dysrhythmias by administering 
                    intravenously sodium bicarbonate (adult dose = 1 ampule; pediatric 
                    dose = 1 Eq/kg). Further bicarbonate therapy should be guided 
                    by ABG measurements. Hemodialysis should be considered in 
                    patients with severe acid-base disturbances that are refractory 
                    to conventional therapy or in cases with significant methanol 
                    levels. </p>
<p> If evidence of shock or hypotension 
                    is observed begin fluid administration. For adults, bolus 
                    1,000 mL/hour intravenous saline or lactated Ringer's solution 
                    if blood pressure is under 80 mm Hg; if systolic pressure 
                    is over 90 mm Hg, an infusion rate of 150 to 200 mL/hour is 
                    sufficient. For children with compromised perfusion administer 
                    a 20 mL/kg bolus of normal saline over 10 to 20 minutes, then 
                    infuse at 2 to 3 mL/kg/hour. Follow with administration of 
                    dopamine (2 to 20 μg/kg/min) or norepinephrine (0.1 to 
                    0.2 μg/kg/min), if necessary.</p>
<h5>Basic Decontamination</h5>
<p>Patients who are able may assist with 
                    their own decontamination. </p>
<p>Because contact with formalin may cause 
                    burns, ED staff should don chemical-resistant jumpsuits (e.g., 
                    of Tyvek or Saranex) or butyl rubber aprons, rubber gloves, 
                    and eye protection if the patient's clothing or skin is wet 
                    with formalin. After the patient has been decontaminated, 
                    no special protective clothing or equipment is required for 
                    ED personnel.</p>
<p>Quickly remove and double-bag contaminated 
                    clothing and personal belongings. Flush exposed skin and hair 
                    with water (preferably under a shower) for 5 minutes. If possible, 
                    wash hair and skin with soap and water, then rinse thoroughly 
                    with water. Use caution to avoid hypothermia when decontaminating 
                    children or the elderly. Use blankets or warmers when appropriate.</p>
<p>Flush exposed eyes with water or saline 
                    for at least 15 minutes. Remove contact lenses if easily removable 
                    without additional trauma to the eye. An ophthalmic anesthetic, 
                    such as 0.5% tetracaine, may be necessary to alleviate blepharospasm, 
                    and lid retractors may be required to allow adequate irrigation 
                    under the eyelids. If pain or injury is evident, continue 
                    irrigation while transporting the patient to the Critical 
                    Care Area.</p>
<p>In cases of formalin ingestion, <b>do 
                    not induce emesis</b>. If water has not been given previously, 
                    administer 4 to 8 ounces if the patient is alert and able 
                    to swallow. The effectiveness of activated charcoal administration 
                    is unknown, but may be beneficial (if not administered previously) 
                    following lavage if it can be performed within 1 hour after 
                    ingestion (administer activated charcoal at 1 gm/kg, usual 
                    adult dose 60-90 g, child dose 25-50 g). A soda can and straw 
                    may be of assistance when offering charcoal to a child. (More 
                    information is provided in <i>Ingestion Exposure</i> under 
                    <i>Critical Care Area</i> below.)</p>
<h4>Critical Care Area</h4>
<p>Be certain that appropriate decontamination 
                    has been carried out (see <i>Decontamination Area</i> above).</p>
<h5>ABC Reminders</h5>
<p>Evaluate and support airway, breathing, 
                    and circulation as in <i>ABC Reminders</i> above. Children 
                    may be more vulnerable to corrosive agents than adults because 
                    of the relatively smaller diameter of their airways. Establish 
                    intravenous access in seriously ill patients if this has not 
                    been done previously. Continuously monitor cardiac rhythm.</p>
<p>Patients who are comatose, hypotensive, 
                    or have seizures or cardiac dysrhythmias should be treated 
                    in the conventional manner. Correct acidosis in the patient 
                    who has coma, seizures, or cardiac dysrhythmias by administering 
                    intravenously sodium bicarbonate (adult dose = 1 ampule; pediatric 
                    dose = 1 Eq/kg). Further bicarbonate therapy should be guided 
                    by ABG measurements. Hemodialysis should be considered in 
                    patients with severe acid-base disturbances that are refractory 
                    to conventional therapy or in cases with significant methanol 
                    levels.</p>
<p>If evidence of shock or hypotension is 
                    observed begin fluid administration. For adults, bolus 1,000 
                    mL/hour intravenous saline or lactated Ringer's solution if 
                    blood pressure is under 80 mm Hg; if systolic pressure is 
                    over 90 mm Hg, an infusion rate of 150 to 200 mL/hour is sufficient. 
                    For children with compromised perfusion administer a 20 mL/kg 
                    bolus of normal saline over 10 to 20 minutes, then infuse 
                    at 2 to 3 mL/kg/hour. Follow with administration of dopamine 
                    (2 to 20 μg/kg/min) or norepinephrine (0.1 to 0.2 μg/kg/min), 
                    if necessary.</p>
<h5>Inhalation Exposure</h5>
<p>Administer supplemental oxygen by mask 
                    to patients who have respiratory complaints. Treat patients 
                    who have bronchospasm with aerosolized bronchodilators. The 
                    use of bronchial sensitizing agents in situations of multiple 
                    chemical exposures may pose additional risks. Consider the 
                    health of the myocardium before choosing which type of bronchodilator 
                    should be administered. Cardiac sensitizing agents may be 
                    appropriate; however, the use of cardiac sensitizing agents 
                    after exposure to certain chemicals may pose enhanced risk 
                    of cardiac arrhythmias (especially in the elderly). Formaldehyde 
                    poisoning is not known to pose additional risk during the 
                    use of bronchial or cardiac sensitizing agents. </p>
<p> Consider racemic epinephrine aerosol 
                    for children who develop stridor. Dose 0.25-0.75 mL of 2.25% 
                    racemic epinephrine solution in 2.5 cc water, repeat every 
                    20 minutes as needed, cautioning for myocardial variability. 
                  </p>
<p> Observe patients who are in respiratory 
                    distress for up to 12 hours and periodically repeat chest 
                    examinations and order other appropriate studies. Follow up 
                    as clinically indicated.</p>
<h5>Skin Exposure</h5>
<p>If formalin or high concentrations of 
                    formaldehyde vapor were in contact with the skin, chemical 
                    burns may result; treat as thermal burns.</p>
<p> Because of their relatively larger surface 
                    area:body weight ratio, children are more vulnerable to toxicants 
                    absorbed through the skin.</p>
<h5>Eye Exposure</h5>
<p>Continue irrigation for at least 15 minutes. 
                    Test visual acuity. Examine the eyes for corneal damage and 
                    treat appropriately. Immediately consult an ophthalmologist 
                    for patients who have severe corneal injuries.</p>
<h5>Ingestion Exposure</h5>
<p><b>Do not induce emesis</b>. Give 4 to 
                    8 ounces of water to alert patients who can swallow if not 
                    done previously. If a large dose has been ingested and the 
                    patient's condition is evaluated within 30 minutes after ingestion, 
                    consider gastric lavage and endoscopy to evaluate the extent 
                    of corrosive injury to the gastrointestinal tract. Care must 
                    be taken when placing the gastric tube because blind gastric-tube 
                    placement may further injure the chemically damaged esophagus 
                    or stomach. Extreme throat swelling may require endotracheal 
                    intubation or cricothyriodotomy. The effectiveness of activated 
                    charcoal in binding formaldehyde is unknown, but may be beneficial 
                    (if not administered previously) following lavage if it can 
                    be performed within 1 hour after ingestion (administer activated 
                    charcoal at 1 gm/kg, usual adult dose 60-90 g, child dose 
                    25-50 g). A soda can and straw may be of assistance when offering 
                    charcoal to a child.</p>
<p> Because children do not ingest large 
                    amounts of corrosive materials, and because of the risk of 
                    perforation from NG intubation, lavage is discouraged in children 
                    unless intubation is performed under endoscopic guidance.</p>
<p> Toxic vomitus or gastric washings should 
                    be isolated (e.g., by attaching the lavage tube to isolated 
                    wall suction or another closed container).</p>
<h5>Antidotes and Other Treatments</h5>
<p>There is no antidote for formaldehyde. 
                    Treat patients who have metabolic acidosis with sodium bicarbonate 
                    (adult dose = 1 ampule; pediatric dose = 1 Eq/kg). Further 
                    correction of acidosis should be guided by ABG measurements.</p>
<p>Hemodialysis is effective in removing 
                    formic acid (formate) and methanol and in correcting severe 
                    metabolic acidosis.</p>
<p>If methanol poisoning from ingestion 
                    of formalin is suspected, as indicated by a serum methanol 
                    level of greater than 20 mg/dL or elevated osmolal gap, start 
                    ethanol infusion. With 10% ethanol, the loading dose is 7.5 
                    mL/kg body weight; maintenance dose is 1.0 to 1.5 mL/kg/hour; 
                    and maintenance dose during hemodialysis is 1.5 to 2.5 mL/kg/hour. 
                    In this setting, the target blood level of ethanol is 0.1 
                    mg/dL.</p>
<h4>Laboratory Tests</h4>
<p>Routine laboratory studies for all exposed 
                    patients include CBC, glucose, and electrolyte determinations. 
                    Additional studies for patients exposed to formaldehyde include 
                    urinalysis (protein, casts, and red blood cells may be present), 
                    methanol level, osmolal gap, and ABG measurements (to monitor 
                    acidosis in severe toxicity). Chest radiography and pulse 
                    oximetry may be helpful in cases of inhalation exposure. Plasma 
                    formaldehyde levels are not useful.</p>
<h4>Disposition and Follow-up</h4>
<p>Consider hospitalizing patients who have 
                    evidence of systemic toxicity from any route of exposure.</p>
<h4>Delayed Effects</h4>
<p>Patients who have substantial ingestion 
                    exposure may develop aspiration pneumonitis or renal failure 
                    and should be admitted to an intensive care unit for observation. 
                    Corrosive gastritis, fibrosis of the stomach (shrinkage and 
                    contracture), hematemesis, or edema and ulceration of the 
                    esophagus may occur.</p>
<p>Patients who have inhalation exposure 
                    and who complain of chest pain, chest tightness, or cough 
                    should be observed and examined periodically for 6 to 12 hours 
                    to detect delayed-onset bronchitis, pneumonia, pulmonary edema, 
                    or respiratory failure.</p>
<p>Formaldehyde poisoning can cause permanent 
                    alterations of nervous system function, including problems 
                    with memory, learning, thinking, sleeping, personality changes, 
                    depression, headache, and sensory and perceptual changes.</p>
<h5>Patient Release</h5>
<p>Patients who are asymptomatic should 
                    be observed for 4 to 6 hours, then discharged if no symptoms 
                    occur during this period. Advise discharged patients to seek 
                    medical care promptly if symptoms develop (see the <i>Formaldehyde-Patient 
                    Information Sheet</i> below).</p>
<h5>Follow-up</h5>
<p>Obtain the name of the patient's primary 
                    care physician so that the hospital can send a copy of the 
                    ED visit to the patient's doctor.</p>
<p> Patients with symptoms of seizures, 
                    convulsions, headache, or confusion, need to be followed for 
                    permanent central nervous system dysfunction with neurobehavioral 
                    toxicity testing, with particular attention to problems with 
                    memory, personality changes, and perceptual dysfunction.</p>
<p> Patients with injury to the mucous membranes 
                    of the respiratory or gastrointestinal tracts should be monitored 
                    for the development of ulceration or fibrosis.</p>
<p> Patients who have corneal injuries should 
                    be reexamined within 24 hours.</p>
<h4>Reporting</h4>
<p>If a work-related incident has occurred, 
                    you may be legally required to file a report; contact your 
                    state or local health department.</p>
<p>Other persons may still be at risk in 
                    the setting where this incident occurred. If the incident 
                    occurred in the workplace, discussing it with company personnel 
                    may prevent future incidents. If a public health risk exists, 
                    notify your state or local health department or other responsible 
                    public agency. When appropriate, inform patients that they 
                    may request an evaluation of their workplace from OSHA or 
                    NIOSH. See Appendices III and IV for a list of agencies that 
                    may be of assistance.</p>

<p>This handout provides information and 
                    follow-up instructions for persons who have been exposed to 
                    formaldehyde. </p>

<b>What is formaldehyde?</b>
<p>Formaldehyde is a nearly colorless, highly 
                    irritating gas with a sharp odor. It dissolves easily in water 
                    and is found in formalin (a solution of formaldehyde, water, 
                    and methanol). Formaldehyde is used in the manufacture of 
                    plastics; urea-formaldehyde foam insulation; and resins used 
                    to make construction materials (e.g., plywood), paper, carpets, 
                    textiles, paint, and furniture.</p>
<b>What immediate health effects can be caused by exposure to formaldehyde?</b>
<p>Formaldehyde can cause irritation of 
                    the eyes, nose, and throat, even at low levels for short periods. 
                    Longer exposure or higher doses can cause coughing or choking. 
                    Severe exposure can cause death from throat swelling or from 
                    chemical burns to the lungs. Direct contact with the skin, 
                    eyes, or gastrointestinal tract can cause serious burns. Drinking 
                    as little as 30 mL (about 2 tablespoons) of formalin can cause 
                    death. Formate, a formaldehyde metabolite, can cause death 
                    or serious systemic effects. Generally, the more serious the 
                    exposure to formaldehyde, the more severe the symptoms. Previously 
                    sensitized persons may develop a skin rash or breathing problems 
                    from very small exposures.</p>
<b>Can formaldehyde poisoning be treated?</b>
<p>There is no antidote for formaldehyde, 
                    but its effects can be treated, and most exposed persons get 
                    well. Patients who have had a serious exposure (with signs 
                    and symptoms such as tearing eyes, running nose, or severe 
                    or persistent coughing) may need to be hospitalized. Patients 
                    with direct exposure to very concentrated vapors or liquid 
                    or who have swallowed formalin may require intensive hospital 
                    treatment and may experience long-term effects.</p>
<b>Are any future health effects likely to occur?</b>
<p>A single small exposure from which a 
                    person recovers quickly is not likely to cause delayed or 
                    long-term effects. After a severe exposure, some symptoms 
                    may not occur for up to 18 hours. See <i>Follow-up Instructions</i> 
                    for signs and symptoms to watch for. If any of them occur, 
                    seek medical care. Long-term, repeated exposure to formaldehyde 
                    in the workplace may cause cancer of the nasal passages.</p>
<b>What tests can be done if a person has been exposed to formaldehyde?</b>
<p>Specific tests for the presence of formaldehyde 
                    in blood or urine may be available, but the results generally 
                    are not useful to the doctor. If a severe exposure has occurred, 
                    blood and urine analyses and other tests may show whether 
                    the lungs have been injured or if systemic effects are possible. 
                    If seizures or convulsions have occurred neurobehavioral toxicity 
                    testing may be necessary. Testing is not needed in every case.</p>
<b>Where can more information about formaldehyde be found?</b>
<p>More information about formaldehyde can 
                    be obtained from your regional poison control center; your 
                    state, county, or local health department; the Agency for 
                    Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR); your doctor; 
                    or a clinic in your area that specializes in occupational 
                    and environmental health. If the exposure happened at work, 
                    you may wish to discuss it with your employer, the Occupational 
                    Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), or the National Institute 
                    for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). Ask the person 
                    who gave you this form for help in locating these telephone 
                    numbers.</p>
