<p><font face="Helvetica">African American Vernacular
            English (AAVE) is the variety formerly known as Black
            English Vernacular or Vernacular Black English among
            sociolinguists, and commonly called Ebonics outside the
            academic community. While some features of AAVE are
            apparently unique to this variety, in its structure it
            also shows many commonalties with other varieties
            including a number of standard and nonstandard English
            varieties spoken in the US and the Caribbean. AAVE has
            been at the heart of several public debates and the
            analysis of this variety has also sparked and sustained
            debates among sociolinguists.</font></p>
<p><font face="Helvetica">It is extremely difficult to
            say how many people speak AAVE because it is not clear
            what exactly this would mean. Some speakers may use some
            distinctive aspects of phonology (pronunciation) and
            lexis (vocabulary) but none of the grammatical features
            associated with the variety. Many sociolinguists would
            reserve the term AAVE for varieties which are marked by
            the occurrence of certain distinctive grammatical
            features some of which are discussed below. Even so it
            may still be difficult to say with any exactitude how
            many AAVE speakers there are since such grammatical
            features occur variably, that is, in alternation with
            standard features. Such variability in the speech both of
            groups and individuals reflects the complex social
            attitudes surrounding AAVE and other nonstandard
            varieties of English and it was this variability which
            initially attracted the attention of sociolinguists such
            as William Labov. </font></p>
<p><font face="Helvetica">The history of AAVE and its
            genetic affiliation, by which we mean what language
            varieties it is related to, are also a matter of
            controversy. Some scholars contend that AAVE developed
            out of the contact between speakers of West African
            languages and speakers of vernacular English varieties.
            According to such a view, West Africans learnt English on
            plantations in the southern Coastal States (Georgia,
            South Carolina, etc.) from a very small number of native
            speakers (the indentured laborers). Some suggest that
            this led to the development of a rudimentary pidgin which
            was later expanded through a process of creolization.
            </font></p>
<p><font face="Helvetica">Others who advocate a contact
            scenario for the development of AAVE suggest that the
            contact language (an early creole-like AAVE) developed
            through processes of second language acquisition.
            According to such a view West Africans newly arrived on
            plantations would have limited access to English
            grammatical models because the number of native speakers
            was so small (just a few indentured servants on each
            plantation). In such a situation a community of second
            language learners might graft what English vocabulary
            that could be garnered from transient encounters onto the
            few grammatical patterns which are common to the
            languages of West Africa. What linguists refer to as
            universal grammar (the law-like rules and tendencies
            which apply to all natural human language) would have
            played a significant role in such processes as well. This
            kind of thing seems to have taken place in the Caribbean
            and may also have happened in some places, at some times
            in the United States. For instance Gullah or Sea Islands
            Creole spoken in the Coastal Islands of South Carolina
            and Georgia seems to have formed in this way. </font></p>
<p><font face="Helvetica">A number of scholars do not
            accept such a scenario. These researchers argue that the
            demographic conditions in the US and the Caribbean (where
            restructured creole languages are widely spoken) were
            really quite different and that the conditions necessary
            for the emergence of a fully fledged creole language were
            never met in the US. These scholars have shown on a
            number of occasions that what look like distinctive
            features of AAVE today actually have a precedent in
            various varieties of English spoken in Great Britain and
            the Southern United States. It seems reasonable to
            suggest that both views are partially correct and that
            AAVE developed to some extent through restructuring while
            it also inherited many of its today distinctive features
            from older varieties of English which were once widely
            spoken.</font></p>
<p><font face="Helvetica">As mentioned above AAVE is a
            matter of some public controversy as was seen most
            recently in the debate over the Ebonics ruling by the
            Oakland School Board. More than anything this debate made
            it clear to sociolinguists that they had failed in one of
            their primary objectives -- to educate the public and to
            disseminate the results of over twenty-five years of
            intense research. Unfortunately, many public policy
            makers and sections of the public hold on to mistaken and
            prejudiced understandings of what AAVE is and what it
            says about the people who speak it. This matter is
            compounded by the fact that, with the AAVE-speaking
            community, attitudes towards the language are complex and
            equivocal. Many AAVE speakers contrast the variety with
            something they refer to as "Talking Proper". At the same
            time these same speakers may also express clearly
            positive attitudes towards AAVE on other occasions and
            may also remark on the inappropriateness of using
            standard English in certain situations. While the
            situation in this case is made more extreme by the
            context of racial and ethnic conflict, inequality and
            prejudice in the United States, it is not unique. Such
            ambivalent and multivalent attitudes towards nonstandard
            varieties of a language have been documented for a great
            many communities around the world and in the United
            States.</font></p>

</b></font></center>
<p><font face="Helvetica">AAVE does not have a vocabulary
            separate from other varieties of English. However AAVE
            speakers do use some words which are not found in other
            varieties and furthermore use some English words in ways
            that differ from the standard dialects. </font></p>
<p><font face="Helvetica">A number of words used in
            standard English may also have their origin in AAVE or at
            least in the West African languages that contributed to
            AAVE's development. These include:</font></p>
<blockquote><font face="Helvetica">banana
                (Mandingo)<br/>
               yam  (Mandingo)<br/>
               okra  (Akan)<br/>
               gumbo  (Western Bantu)</font></blockquote>
<p><font face="Helvetica">A discussion of AAVE vocabulary
            might proceed by noting that words can be seen to be
            composed of a form (a sound signal) and a meaning. In
            some cases both the form and the meaning are taken from
            West African sources. In other case the form is from
            English but the meaning appears to be derived from West
            African sources. Some cases are ambiguous and seem to
            involve what the late Fredric Cassidy called a multiple
            etymology (the form can be traced to more than one
            language -- e.g. "cat" below).</font></p>
<p><font face="Helvetica">West African Form + West
            African Meaning:</font></p>
<blockquote><font face="Helvetica"><b>bogus</b>
                'fake/fraudulent' cf. Hausa <i>boko</i>, or
               <i>boko-boko</i> 'deceit, fraud'.</font>
<p><font face="Helvetica"><b>hep, hip</b>  'well
               informed, up-to-date' cf. Wolof <i>hepi, hipi</i> 'to
               open one's eyes, be aware of what is going
               on'.</font></p></blockquote>
<p><font face="Helvetica">English Form + West African
            Meaning:</font></p>
<blockquote><font face="Helvetica"><b>cat </b> 'a
               friend, a fellow, etc.' cf. Wolof <i>-kat </i>(a
               suffix denoting a person)</font>
<p><font face="Helvetica"><b>cool</b>  'calm,
               controlled' cf. Mandingo suma 'slow' (literally
               'cool')</font></p>
<p><font face="Helvetica"><b>dig</b>  'to
               understand, appreciate, pay attention' cf. Wolof
               <i>deg, dega</i> 'to understand,
               appreciate'</font></p>
<p><font face="Helvetica"><b>bad</b>  'really
               good' </font></p></blockquote>
<p><font face="Helvetica">In West African languages and
            Caribbean creoles a word meaning 'bad' is often used to
            mean 'good' or 'alot/intense'. For instance, in Guyanese
            Creole <i>mi laik am bad, yu noo</i> means 'I like him
            alot'. Dalby mentions Mandingo (Bambara) <i>a nyinata
            jaw-ke</i> 'She's very pretty.' (literally 'She is
            beautiful bad.'); cf. also Krio ( a creole language
            spoken in West Africa)<i> mi gud baad.</i> </font></p>
<p><font face="Helvetica">Loan Translations:</font></p>
<p><font face="Helvetica">Another interesting set of
            vocabulary items are called loan translations or
            "calques". In such cases a complex idea is expressed in
            some West African language by a combination of two words.
            In AAVE these African words appear to have been directly
            translated and the same concept is expressed by the
            combination of the equivalent English items</font></p>
<blockquote><font face="Helvetica"><b>bad-eye</b>
                'nasty look', cf. Mandingo,
               <i>ny</i></font><font face="Helvetica" size="-2"><i>E</i></font><font face="Helvetica"><i>-jugu</i>
               'hateful glance' (lit. 'bad-eye')</font>
<p><font face="Helvetica"><b>big-eye</b>
                'greedy', cf. Ibo. <i>anya uku</i> 'covetous'
               (literally 'big-eye').</font></p></blockquote>
<p><font face="Helvetica">Any discussion of AAVE
            vocabulary must take note of the many recent innovations
            which occur in this variety and which tend to spread
            rapidly to other varieties of English. Most recent
            innovations are not enduring. These lexical items give
            regionally and generationally restricted varieties of
            AAVE their particular texture.</font></p></blockquote>

</b></font></center>
<p><font face="Helvetica">AAVE and standard English
            pronunciation are sometimes quite different. People
            frequently attach significance to such differences in
            pronunciation or accent and as such the study of
            phonology (the systematic a patterning of sounds in
            language) is an important part of sociolinguistics. It
            should be noted that phonology has nothing to do with
            spelling. The way something is spelt is often not a good
            indication of the way it "should be", or much less is,
            pronounced. </font></p>
<p><font face="Helvetica" size="+1"><b>Consonants</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Helvetica">Clusters at the ends of
            words:</font></p>
<p><font face="Helvetica">When two consonants appear at
            the end of a word (for instance the <b>st</b> in
            <b>test</b>), they are often reduced: the final <b>t</b>
            is deleted. This happens, to some extent, in every
            variety of English including standard ones. In AAVE the
            consonant cluster is reduced variably (i.e. it does not
            happen every time) and systematically.</font></p>
<p><font face="Helvetica">Sociolinguists have shown that
            the frequency of reduction can be expressed by a rule
            which takes account of a number of interacting facts.
            Crucially, the frequency of reduction depends on the
            environment in which the sound occurs. The following two
            factors, among others, have been found to affect the
            frequency of reduction in consonant clusters</font></p>
<p><font face="Helvetica">If the next word starts with a
            consonant, it is more likely to reduce than if the next
            word starts with a vowel. For example, reduction is more
            likely to occur in <b>west side </b>(becoming <b>wes
            side</b>) than in <b>west end</b>.</font></p>
<p><font face="Helvetica">A final <b>t</b> or <b>d</b> is
            more likely to be deleted if it is not part of the past
            tense <b>-ed</b> than if it is. (The past tense
            <b>-ed</b> suffix is pronounced as<b> t</b> or <b>d</b>
            or<b> Id</b> in English depending on the preceding
            sound.) For example, reduction is more likely to occur in
            <b>John ran fast </b>(becoming <b>John ran fas</b>) than
            in <b>John passed the teacher in his car</b>.</font></p>
<p><font face="Helvetica">The <b>th </b>sounds:
            </font></p>
<p><font face="Helvetica">The written symbol <b>th
            </b>can represent two different sounds in English: both
            an "unvoiced" sound as in <b>thought</b>, <b>thin</b> and
            <b>think</b>, and a "voiced" sound as in <b>the</b>,
            <b>they</b> and <b>that</b>. In AAVE the pronunciation of
            this sound depends on where in a word it is
            found.</font></p>
<p><font face="Helvetica">At the beginning of a word, the
            voiced sound (e.g. in <b>that</b>) is regularly
            pronounced as <b>d</b> so 'the', 'they' and 'that' are
            pronounced as <b>de</b>, <b>dey</b> and <b>dat</b>. AAVE
            shares this feature with many other nonstandard dialects,
            including those of the East Coast of United States and
            Canada. Less common in AAVE is the pronunciation of the
            unvoiced sound as <b>t</b>. Thus 'thin' can become
            <b>tin</b> but rarely does. This however is a very common
            feature of Caribbean creoles in which 'think' is
            regularly pronounced as <b>tink</b>, etc. When the th
            sound is followed by <b>r</b>, it is possible in AAVE to
            pronounce the <b>th</b> as <b>f</b> as in <b>froat</b>
            for 'throat'.</font></p>
<p><font face="Helvetica">Within a word, the unvoiced
            sound as in <b>nothing</b>, <b>author</b> or <b>ether</b>
            is often pronounced as <b>f</b>. Thus AAVE speakers will
            sometimes say <b>nufn</b> 'nothing' and <b>ahfuh</b>
            'author'. The voiced sound, within a word, may be
            pronounced <b>v</b>. So 'brother' becomes <b>bruvah</b>,
            etc. </font></p>
<p><font face="Helvetica">At the end of a word, <b>th</b>
            is often pronounced <b>f</b> in AAVE. For instance 'Ruth'
            is pronounced <b>Ruf</b>; 'south' is pronounced<b>
            souf</b>. When the preceding sound is a nasal (e.g.
            <b>n</b> or <b>m</b>) the<b> th</b> is often pronounced
            as<b> t</b> as in <b>tent</b> for 'tenth'; <b>mont
            </b>for 'month'. </font></p>
<p><font face="Helvetica">The sounds<b> l</b> and
            <b>r</b>:</font></p>
<p><font face="Helvetica">When they do not occur at the
            beginning of a word <b>l</b> and <b>r </b>often undergo a
            process known as "vocalization" and are pronounced as
            <b>uh</b>. This is most apparent in a post-vocalic
            position (after a vowel). For instance 'steal', 'sister',
            'nickel' become <b>steauh</b>, <b>sistuh</b>,
            <b>nickuh</b>. In some varieties of AAVE (e.g. in the
            Southern US),<b> r</b> is not pronounced after the vowels
            <b>o</b> and <b>u</b>. The words <b>door</b> and
            <b>doe</b>, <b>four</b> and <b>foe</b>, and <b>sure</b>
            and <b>show</b> can be pronounced alike.</font></p>
<p><font face="Helvetica" size="+1"><b>Vowels</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Helvetica">Nasalized vowels:</font></p>
<p><font face="Helvetica">When a nasal (<b>n</b> or<b>
            m</b>) follows a vowel, AAVE speakers sometimes delete
            the nasal consonant and nasalize the vowel. This
            nasalization is written with a tilde ( ~ ) above the
            vowel. So 'man' becomes <b>mã</b>.</font></p>
<p><font face="Helvetica">Nasals consonants and front
            vowels:</font></p>
<p><font face="Helvetica">In many varieties of English,
            including standard varieties, the vowels <b>i</b> in
            <b>pin</b> and<b> e</b> in <b>pen</b> sound different in
            all words. In AAVE, these sounds are merged before a
            nasal (like <b>n</b> or <b>m</b>). So in AAVE <b>pin</b>
            and <b>pen</b> are pronounced with the same vowel. Most
            Southern US varieties of English merge these vowels too,
            so this is only a distinctive feature of AAVE in the
            northern United States.</font></p>
<p><font face="Helvetica">Diphthongs:</font></p>
<p><font face="Helvetica">Some vowels like those in
            <b>night</b> and <b>my</b> or <b>about</b> and <b>cow</b>
            are called "diphthongs". This means that when the vowel
            is pronounced, the tongue starts at one place in the
            mouth and moves as the vowel is being pronounced. In AAVE
            the vowel in 'night' or in 'my' is often not a diphthong.
            So when pronouncing the words with this diphthong, AAVE
            speakers (and speakers of Southern varieties as well) do
            not move the tongue to the front top position. So 'my' is
            pronounced <b>ma</b> as in <b>he's over at ma sister's
            house</b>.</font></p>
<p><font face="Helvetica">Stress:</font></p>
<p><font face="Helvetica">AAVE s from some other
            varieties in the placement of stress in a word. So, where
            words like <b>police</b>, <b>hotel</b> and <b>July
            </b>are pronounced with stress on the last syllable in
            standard English, in AAVE they may have stress placed on
            the first syllable so that you get <b><i>po-</i>lice</b>,
            <b><i>ho-</i>tel </b>and <b><i>Ju</i>-ly</b>.</font></p>

<p> </p></center>
<blockquote><font face="Helvetica" size="+1"><b>The verb
            "be"</b></font>
<p><font face="Helvetica">Standard English uses a
            conjugated <b>be</b> verb (called a copula) in a number
            of different sentences. (This may occur as <b>is</b>,
            <b>'s</b>, <b>are</b>,<b> 're</b>, etc.) In AAVE this
            verb is often not included. The frequency of inclusion
            has been shown to depend on a variety of factors. Here
            are some examples:</font></p>
<p><font face="Helvetica">  In future sentences
            with <b>gonna</b> or <b>gon </b>(see below):</font></p>
<blockquote><font face="Helvetica"><b>I don't care what
               he say, you __ gon laugh.</b></font>
<p><font face="Helvetica"><b>...as long as i's kids
               around he's gon play rough or however they're playing.
               </b></font></p></blockquote>
<p><font face="Helvetica">  Before verbs with
            the<b> -ing </b>or <b>-in</b>
            ending(progressive):</font></p>
<blockquote><font face="Helvetica"><b>I tell him to be
               quiet because he don't know what he __ talking
               about.</b></font>
<p><font face="Helvetica"><b>I mean, he may say
               something's out of place but he __ cleaning up behind
               it and you can't get mad at him.</b></font></p></blockquote>
<p><font face="Helvetica">  Before adjectives
            and expressions of location:</font></p>
<blockquote><font face="Helvetica"><b>He __ all
               right.</b></font>
<p><font face="Helvetica"><b>And Alvin, he __ kind of
               big, you know?</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Helvetica"><b>She __ at home. The club
               __ on one corner, the Bock is on the other.
               </b></font></p></blockquote>
<p><font face="Helvetica">  Before nouns (or
            phrases with nouns)</font></p>
<blockquote><font face="Helvetica"><b>He __ the one who
               had to go try to pick up the peacock. </b></font>
<p><font face="Helvetica"><b>I say, you __ the one
               jumping up to leave, not me.</b></font></p></blockquote>
<p><font face="Helvetica" size="+1"><b>Agreement</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Helvetica">Standard English varieties mark
            grammatical agreement between the subject and predicate
            in the present tense. If the subject is third person
            singular (he, she, it or the name of a person or object),
            an<b> -s</b> appears at the end of a regular verb. (e.g.
            <b>John walks to the store</b>). In AAVE the verb is
            rarely marked in this way. When regular verbs occur with
            such<b> -s </b>marking, they often carry special
            emphasis. Standard English also has agreement in a number
            of irregular and frequently used verbs such as <b>has
            </b>vs <b>have</b> and <b>is </b>vs <b>are</b> and <b>was
            </b>vs <b>were</b>. In AAVE these distinctions are not
            always made. </font></p>
<p><font face="Helvetica" size="+1"><b>Tense and
            aspect</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Helvetica">The verb in AAVE is often used
            without any ending. As is the case with the English
            creoles, there are some separate words that come before
            the verb which show when or how something happens. These
            are called "tense/aspect markers".</font></p>
<p><font face="Helvetica">Past tense: </font></p>
<p><font face="Helvetica">Past tense may be conveyed by
            the surrounding discourse (with the help of adverbials
            such as, for example, "last night", "three years ago",
            "back in them days", etc., or by the use of conjunctions
            which convey a sequence of actions (e.g. "then"), or by
            the use of an ending as in standard English. The
            frequency with which the<b> -ed </b>ending occurs depends
            on a number of factors including the sounds which follow
            it. </font></p>
<p><font face="Helvetica">Some past events are conveyed
            by placing <b>been</b> before the verb. Speakers of
            standard English may mistake this for the standard
            English "present perfect" with the "have" or "has"
            deleted. However the AAVE sentence with been is in fact
            quite different from the standard English present
            perfect. This can be seen by comparing two sentences such
            as the following:</font></p>
<blockquote><font face="Helvetica">Standard English
               present perfect: <b>He has been married.</b></font>
<p><font face="Helvetica">AAVE <i>been</i>: <b>He been
               married.</b></font></p></blockquote>
<p><font face="Helvetica">In the standard English
            sentence the implication is that he is now no longer
            married. However, in the AAVE sentence the implication is
            quite the opposite: he is still married. </font></p>
<p><font face="Helvetica">Sentences equivalent to
            standard English perfects such as discussed above may be
            conveyed by the use of <b>done</b> in AAVE. For example
            the standard sentence "He has eaten his dinner" can be
            expressed as <b>He done eat his dinner</b>. </font></p>
<p><font face="Helvetica">Future:</font></p>
<p><font face="Helvetica">Future events and those that
            have not yet occurred are marked by<b> gon</b> or
            <b>gonna</b> (see above).</font></p>
<p><font face="Helvetica">Events in progress: </font></p>
<p><font face="Helvetica">Besides using the verb with the
            ending <b>-ing </b>or <b>-in</b> to convey that an event
            is in progress, AAVE has a number of other words which
            add particular nuances. For instance, if the activity is
            vigorous and intentional, the sentence may include the
            word <b>steady</b>. The item <b>steady</b> can be used to
            mark actions that occur consistently or persistently, as
            in <b>Ricky Bell be steady steppin in them number
            nines</b>.</font></p>
<p><font face="Helvetica">Events that occur habitually or
            repeatedly are often marked by <b>be</b> in AAVE as in
            <b>She be working all the time</b>.</font></p>
<p><font face="Helvetica" size="+1"><b>Negatives</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Helvetica">AAVE has a number of ways of
            marking negation. Like a number of other varieties of
            English, AAVE uses <b>ain't </b>to negate the verb in a
            simple sentence. In common with other nonstandard
            dialects of English, AAVE uses <b>ain't </b>in standard
            English sentences which use "haven't". For example
            standard "I haven't seen him." is equivalent to AAVE <b>I
            ain't seen him</b>. Unlike most other nonstandard
            varieties of English, AAVE speakers also sometimes use
            <b>ain't </b>for standard "didn't" as in the following
            examples</font></p>
<blockquote><font face="Helvetica"><b>I ain't step on no
               line.</b></font>
<p><font face="Helvetica"><b>I said, "I ain't run the
               stop sign," and he said, "you ran it!"</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Helvetica"><b>I ain't believe you that
               day, man.</b></font></p></blockquote>
<p><font face="Helvetica">As the first sentence above
            shows, AAVE also allows negation to be marked in more
            that one position in the sentence (so called double or
            multiple negation). In this respect, AAVE resembles
            French and a number of other Romance languages and also a
            number of English creoles. Certain kinds of nouns
            actually require negative marking in negative sentences.
            In so far as the negation must be expressed with
            indefinite nouns (e.g. "anything", "anyone" etc.), this
            is a form of agreement marking. (e.g. <b>I ain't see
            nothing</b>). </font></p>
<p><font face="Helvetica">AAVE also has a special
            negative construction which linguists call "negative
            inversion". An example from Toni Morrison's <i>Song of
            Solomon</i> follows:</font></p>
<blockquote><font face="Helvetica"><b>Pilate they
               remembered as a pretty woods-wild girl "that
               <i>couldn't nobody put shoes on</i>."</b></font></blockquote>
<p><font face="Helvetica">In this example (in the part in
            italics), a negative auxiliary (<b>couldn't</b>) is moved
            in front of the subject (<b>nobody</b>). Some other
            examples illustrate this:</font></p>
<blockquote><font face="Helvetica"><b>Ain't nobody talkin' to you!</b></font>
<p><font face="Helvetica"><b>Can't nobody beat
               'em</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Helvetica"><b>Can't nobody say nothin'
               to dem peoples!</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Helvetica"><b>Don' nobody say nothing
               after that. </b>(Ledbetter, born 1861)</font></p>
<p><font face="Helvetica"><b>Wasn't nobody in there
               but me an' him. </b>(Isom Moseley, born
               1856)</font></p></blockquote>
