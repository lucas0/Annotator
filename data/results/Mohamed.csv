So it was a little strange that when the Oscar winner was asked about her political leanings at a recent event, she went a different route. I dont like the word politics, because I feel like thats the game, she said. Thats the show. I like government.'At a luncheon held in the films honor today at Manhattans Four Seasons restaurant, Bullock alongside co-stars Anthony Mackie and Zoe Kazan participated in a twenty minute chat moderated by NBCs Willie Geist about many aspects of the film. But things really got moving when the conversation skewed more political. When asked by an audience member about how she thinks her character would advise Donald Trumps campaign, Bullock didnt hold back. Unlike her character Calamity Jane Bodine, Bullock said she isnt so interested in the spectacle of politics, and shes particularly disinterested in the performance that Republican presidential candidate Trump is currently putting on.Up till two days ago, I kept saying, Donald Trump needs absolutely no help from anyone, hes already up in the polls, but thats shifted, I think, she said. Secretly, I dont want anyone to be advised, because I want to see who everyone truly is. The thing that makes him so engaging on television is the thing that, you know, might have gotten him derailed. He just says whatever he wants to say, so Im sure the strategist would say, You gotta put a plug in it at some point. Even if you feel that way, dont say it.'Conversely, she added, there is an upside to Trumps unfiltered approach. Im grateful that he says it, so you know who youre dealing with, she said. Im sure someone is coming in to put a little sock in it, going, okay, Donald, just dont' Stop tweeting!, Kazan interrupted. Yes, stop! Bullock laughed.Despite her turn in the film, however, Bullock doesnt fancy herself any kind of expert on political strategy. I could never do this business, I dont have the stomach for it. I would fail miserably, she said.Still, Bullock is optimistic about the future. I like to think that there is still a reason behind the infrastructure that is for the greater good. Albeit, thats naive sometimes, but I believe in the possibility of there being change, Bullock said, citing one recent example: You see what happens to a country and to the world when people of the same sex can get married and love each other legally. That day, you saw so much love, just explode, theres like almost a moment of silence. Later, she tacked on a bipartisan perspective. Whether its Democratic or Republican, moderate or independent, I dont care give me the best person to take care of our country and those who are already here, she said. Thats the person I want.Our Brand is Crisis opens Friday, October 30.READ MORE: Toronto Review: Sandra Bullock Carries Our Brand Is CrisisSign Up: Stay on top of the latest breaking film and TV news!

http://www.politifact.com/ohio/statements/2013/apr/02/progressohio/progressohio-says-ohio-lacks-law-prohibiting-emplo/,"	""It is legal in Ohio to fire an employee or evict a tenant just for being gay.""",true,"['Gays and Lesbians', 'Housing', 'Jobs', 'Workers']",http://www.businessmanagementdaily.com/,http://www.businessmanagementdaily.com/35001/sexual-orientation-discrimination-vs-sexual-stereotypes-discrimination-a-distinction-without-a-difference,2013/04/02,"Matthew Inskeep sued his employer, claiming that he was harassed on the job because of his sexual orientation. In Inskeep v. Western Reserve Transit Auth. (Ohio Ct. App. 3/8/13), the court tossed out his case. And, it did so without even reaching the merits of what allegedly happened to Matthew Inskeep. Instead, it ruled that because Ohios employment discrimination statute does not protect sexual orientation, Inskeep had no claim to bring.As the court statedSeveral states have chosen to enact legislation prohibiting discrimination against homosexuals by adding sexual orientation as a protected status in their discrimination statutes. Because Ohio has not, it has been concluded that sexual orientation is not protected....Although allowing same-sex sexual harassment cases to proceed where based on sex, we still express agreement with the premise that R.C. 4112.02 does not protect sexual orientation.....Ohios lack of protections for sexual orientation discrimination parallels federal law, and the law of 28 other states.Compare the result of Inskeep, however, to the result of another case recently decided under the parallel federal statuteKoren v. The Ohio Bell Telephone Co. (N.D. Ohio 8/14/12). In that case, the employee claimed that his employer fired him because he is a homosexual and took his husbands last name. The court concluded that Koren pleaded an unlawful sexual stereotyping claim under Title VII:The Court agrees with Koren: homosexual males do not by definition, fail to conform to the traditional gender norms by changing their surname upon marriage. And here, Koren chose to take his spouses surnamea traditionally feminine practiceand his co-workers and superiors observed that gender non-conformance when Koren requested to be called by his married name....There is no apparent difference in the employers intent between Inskeep and Koren. Both employers appear to have treated the plaintiffs differently because they are gay. The different results, however, flow from how each plaintiff described the claimInskeep called it sexual orientation discrimination and lost, while Koren called it unlawful sex-based stereotypes and won.It is time that we do away with these ridiculous distinctions. Discrimination is discrimination, no matter what creative label we slap on it. A company should not evade liability for invidious discrimination because of a happenstance of pleading.The time is coming when Congress will end this debate. I believe that before President Obama leaves office, he will sign the Employment Non-Discrimination Act into law and finally include sexual orientation as a class Title VII protects.Until that time, employers should be aware that courts are increasingly protecting sexual orientation under theories of unlawful sex-based stereotypes. To account for these issues, I suggest you amend your own policies, outlaw sexual orientation discrimination in your business, and send a signal to all of your employees that you are a business of inclusion, not one of bigotry and exclusion.
