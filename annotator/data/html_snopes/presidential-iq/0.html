<u>January 14, 2001</u> <h1>Bush gets bad rap on intelligence</h1>
<p><i>By Aubrey Immelman<br/>
</i><em>Times columnist</em></p>
<font size="2">Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold; <br/>
      Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world, <br/>
      The blood-dimmed tide is loosed ...  <br/>
      — W. B. Yeats, "The Second Coming"</font>
<p>A week from today, the sun will rise on the second Bush presidency in a
      generation, in what for some may be a day of trepidation. Does Bush the
      Younger have what it takes to lead the nation in the new millennium?
      </p><p>It's a question that transcends concerns about George W. Bush's
      conservatism or a path to power marred by youthful indiscretions. It's not
      about ideology or character; it's a question of cognitive capacity.
      </p><p>The Spanish physician Juan Huarte in 1575 proposed one of the earliest
      recorded definitions of intelligence: learning ability, imaginativeness
      and good judgment. Undoubtedly, the mantle of the modern U.S. presidency
      imposes a steep learning curve and demands vision, wisdom and discretion.
      </p><p>Equally clear is this: Sheer intellectual brilliance does not cut it in
      the Oval Office.
      </p><p>In terms of brute brainpower, the smartest postwar presidents were
      Richard Nixon, a Duke Law School graduate with a reported IQ of 143; Jimmy
      Carter, who graduated in the top 10 percent of his Naval Academy class;
      and Rhodes scholar Bill Clinton, a graduate of Georgetown University and
      Yale Law School. Deeply flawed presidencies all, despite their potential.
      </p><p>In contrast, take high school graduate Harry Truman <font size="2">—</font>
      railroad worker, clerk, bookkeeper, farmer, road inspector and small-town
      postmaster <font size="2">—</font> or Ronald Reagan, sports announcer
      and B-list actor with mediocre college credentials.
      </p><p>Despite their intellectual limitations, both achieved substantial
      political success as president. And, to press home the point, there is
      Franklin D. Roosevelt, a top-tier president in rankings of historical
      greatness, whom the late Supreme Court justice Oliver Wendell Holmes
      branded "a second-rate intellect but a first-class temperament."
      </p><p>Huarte's notion of intelligence comprises a mix of mental acumen and
      emotional discernment that provides a sound foundation for modern-day
      presidential success.
      </p><p>To put it bluntly, the president need not be the sharpest tool in the
      shed, but he does need a full deck of cards. He must be comfortable in his
      own skin, free of emotional demons, and surround himself with competent
      people. With apologies to Saturday Night Live's Stuart Smalley, the
      successful president need not be a towering giant, he just needs to be
      good enough, smart enough <font size="2">—</font> and, doggone-it,
      people must like him.
      </p><p>George W. Bush can be likable and charming. But, as the New York Times
      pondered in a front-page article on June 19, 2000, "is he smart
      enough to be president?"
      </p><p>Unlike John F. Kennedy, who obtained an IQ score of 119, or Al Gore,
      who achieved scores of 133 and 134 on intelligence tests taken at the
      beginning of his high school freshman and senior years, no IQ data are
      available for George W. Bush. But we do know that the young Bush
      registered a score of 1206 on the SAT, the most widely used test of
      college aptitude. (The more cerebral Al Gore obtained 1355.)
      </p><p>Statistically, Bush's test performance places him in the top 16 percent
      of prospective college students <font size="2">—</font> hardly the mark
      of a dimwit. Of course, the SAT is not designed as an IQ test. But it is
      highly correlated with general intelligence, to the tune of .80. In plain
      language, the SAT is two parts a measure of general intelligence and one
      part a measure of specific scholastic reasoning skills and abilities.
      </p><p>If Bush could score in the top 16 percent of college applicants on the
      SAT, he would almost certainly rank higher on tests of general
      intelligence, which are normed with reference to the general population.
      But even if his rank remained constant at the 84th-percentile level of his
      SAT score, it would translate to an IQ score of 115.
      </p><p>It's tempting to employ Al Gore's IQ:SAT ratio of 134:1355 as a formula
      for estimating Bush's probable intelligence quotient <font size="2">—</font>
      an exercise in fuzzy statistics that predicts a score of 119. If the
      number sounds familiar, it's precisely the IQ score attributed to Kennedy,
      whom Princeton political scientist Fred Greenstein, in "The
      Presidential Difference," commended as "a quick study, whose wit
      was an indication of a subtle mind."
      </p><p>As a final clue to Bush's cognitive capacity, consider data from Joseph
      Matarazzo's leading text on intelligence and the National Longitudinal
      Survey of Youth: The average IQ is about 105 for high school graduates,
      115 for college graduates and 125 for people with advanced professional
      degrees. With his MBA from Harvard Business School, it's not unreasonable
      to assume that Bush's IQ surpasses the 115 of the average
      bachelor's-degree-only college graduate.
      </p><p>George W. Bush has often been underestimated. Almost certainly, he's
      received a bad rap on the count of cognitive capacity. Indications are
      that, in the arena of mental ability, Bush is in the same league as John
      F. Kennedy, who graduated 65th in his high-school class of 110 and, in the
      words of one biographer, "stumbled through Latin, French,
      mathematics, and English but made respectable marks in physics and
      history."
      </p><p>The feisty, sometimes-irreverent Bush's mental acuity may lack a little
      of the sharpness of his tongue, but plainly it is sharp enough. The real
      test for the president-elect will be whether he possesses the emotional
      intelligence <font size="2">—</font> the triumph of reason over rigidity
      and restraint over impulse <font size="2">—</font> to steer the course.
