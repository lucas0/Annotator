<p></p><center><b><font size="+1">SWEET CORN</font></b></center><p></p>
<p>  Sweet corn (<i>Zea mays rugosa*</i>) is not only
one of the most common but also one of the most important of vegetable
crops. Like field corn it may be grown on a wide variety of soils.
A corn plant requires more space than does the individual of any
of its cereal relatives. In many varieties the production of suckers
or secondary stems or branches from the lower nodes is very pronounced.
These branches develop their own roots.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1">* The nomenclature is according to Bailey,
  L. H., "Manual of Cultivated Plants," 1924.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>  Sweet corn of the Stowell's Evergreen variety,
a standard, main-crop variety, was planted June 2. This is one
of the old, well-known, and most important canning varieties.
It produces a rank growth. The hills were spaced 42 inches apart
and three to four plants were permitted to grow in each hill.
The grains were planted 2.5 to 3 inches deep. Weeds were kept
in check by repeated shallow cultivation.</p>
<p>  <b>Early Development.</b>--An initial examination
was made June 18, only 16 days after planting. The plants were
7 inches tall, in the sixth-leaf stage, and had a leaf spread
of 8 inches. The total leaf surface averaged 45 square inches.
Unlike field corn, which usually has three roots making up the
primary root system, sweet corn has but one. This seed root was
already 18 inches long on most of the plants examined. Thus, allowing
3 or 4 days for germination, it had grown at the rate of over
1 inch a day. The direction of growth was not downward but obliquely
outward and downward. The lateral spread was sometimes more than
1 foot, but none penetrated deeper than 11 inches (Fig. 3). The
last 3 inches of root were unbranched but the remainder was covered
with branches at the rate of 25 per inch. The younger ones were
scarcely 1/4 inch in length, but toward the seed they became progressively
longer and many on the older portion of the root were 3 inches
long. A few were even more extensive, reaching a maximum length
of 10 inches. The longer and older laterals were densely rebranched
with laterals seldom exceeding 1/4 inch, but the younger ones
were simple. Occasionally, a second long root arose from the base
of the stem near the seed. one of these is shown in the drawing.</p>

<p><font size="-1">  Fig. 3.--Root system of sweet

</blockquote>
<p>  In this connection it is interesting to note that
recent studies on field corn have shown a positive correlation
between high seminal-root production and yield. There is also
some evidence that high seminal-root production tends to enhance
vigor of early growth. <font size="-2">141</font></p>
<p>  The secondary root system,. originating from a
node on the stem about 1 inch below the soil surface, had also
begun to appear. This consisted of 6 to 10 rather thick, mostly
horizontally spreading roots. Apparently these were of rather
recent origin but were developing rapidly. Some were 8 inches
long, others just emerging from the stem. The younger and shorter
ones were smooth and unbranched like the 3 to 4 inches on the
ends of the older ones. Otherwise short branches occurred at the
rate of 20 to 25 per inch. Root hairs were very abundant and the
roots were so covered with adhering soil particles, except the
shiny white ends, that they appeared very thick and black even
after removal from the soil. Figure 3 shows that the total absorbing
area of the roots really was quite large. In the case of field
corn it has been found to exceed that of the tops.</p>
<p>  Experiments with the smaller cereals, <i>viz.,</i>
wheat, barley, and rye, indicate that the primary root system
(seminal roots and their branches) serve largely the main stem,
whereas the nodal roots chiefly serve the tillers. To what degree
a similar relationship holds in sweet corn would constitute an
interesting and valuable experiment. <font size="-2">82</font></p>
<p>  <b>Relation of Absorbing Area to Soil Moisture.</b>
<font size="-2">169</font>--In one experiment Nebraska White Prize
dent corn of the <i>F</i><font size="-2">1</font> generation from
two pure-line parental strains and, consequently, of similar hereditary
constitution was grown for 5 weeks in fertile loess soil with
original water contents of 9 and 19 per cent, respectively, above
the hygroscopic coefficient. The plants were in the eighth-leaf
stage when the roots were examined. In the more moist soil the
area of the tops, including the stem and both surfaces of the
leaves, was 82 per cent of that of the roots. But in the drier
soil the tops had only 46 per cent as great an area as the roots.
In other words, the absorbing area of the roots (exclusive of
root hairs which covered the entire root system) was 1.2 times
as great as the area of the tops in the more moist soil and 2.2
times as great in the drier soil. The total length of the main
roots in the two cases was about the same, as was also their diameter.
In neither case did the main roots make up more than 11 per cent
of the total absorbing area. In the drier soil 75 per cent of
the area was furnished by the primary laterals and the remaining
14 per cent by branches from these. But in the more moist soil
the primary branches furnished only 38 per cent of the root area.
It seemed as though the plant had blocked out a root system quite
inadequate to meet the heavy demands for absorption made by the
vigorous tops, and as the soil became drier the remaining 51 per
cent of the area was furnished by an excellent development of
secondary and tertiary branches.</p>
<p>  Maize, in loess soil with only 2 to 3 per cent
of water in excess of the hygroscopic coefficient, had, in proportion
to the length of the main roots, about one-third more laterals
than it had in a similar soil of medium water content. Moreover,
the absorbing area in comparison to tops was greater.</p>
<p>  Similar top-and-root area relations have been found
to hold for other plants when grown in like soils of different
water content. Numerous experiments have shown that root extent
is greater in dry Soil. <font size="-2">68</font> Because of the
difficulty of recovering the root system in its entirety from
the soil and the onerous task of measuring the length and diameter
of all its parts, but few data are available. For example, a plant
of maize only in the eighth-leaf stage has from 8,000 to 10,000
laterals arising from the 15 to 23 main roots. Usually the relations
are stated in the ratio of the dry weight of roots to tops, an
expression difficult of interpretation in terms of function. The
larger, thicker, and heavier roots are least significant, the
delicate branchlets, too often lost in such determinations, being
of greatest importance although adding little to weight.</p>
<p>  <b>Midsummer Growth.</b>--A second examination
was made July 27. The plants had a height of about 4.5 feet and
were very leafy. The parent stalk had usually given rise to two
to four tillers but sometimes there were as many as six. The very
numerous leaves, averaging 2.5 feet long and 3.5 inches wide at
the base, offered a very large area for food manufacture and transpiration.
For example, one plant with four tillers had a leaf surface of
20 square feet. The tassels were about half out.</p>
<p>  The root system had made a really wonderful growth
and was clearly in a state of very rapid development. After considerable
study a plant with four tillers was selected as typically representative,
and was fully examined and described. There were 45 roots of larger
diameter, 3 to 4 millimeters. These were older and longer than
the others. Another lot of 15 roots were about, 1.5 millimeters
in diameter and also extended widely. In addition there were 33
young roots of a diameter of 1.5 to 3.5 millimeters and of an
average length of 4 inches (varying from 1.2 to 8.5 inches). Finally,
29 smaller, fine roots only 0.5 millimeter thick and about 2 inches
long arose from the root crown. It is impossible to represent
all of these in detail in the most carefully executed drawing.
But at least the principal features can be clearly portrayed (Fig.
4).</p>
<blockquote>
<p><img align="BOTTOM" border="0" height="266" naturalsizeflag="3" src="http://soilandhealth.org/wp-content/uploads/01aglibrary/010137veg.roots/fig4.jpg" width="455"/></p>
<p><font size="-1">  Fig. 4.--Root system of sweet
  corn 8 weeks old.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>  The primary root (often erroneously called temporary),
which could still be easily identified, pursued an obliquely downward
and outward course, ending 28 inches horizontally from the base
of the stalk and at a depth of 37 inches. Only a few roots penetrated
deeper. One, however, was found near the 4-foot level, but the
usual depth of maximum penetration scarcely exceeded 3 feet. The
working level was at a depth of 2 feet and a maximum lateral spread
of 3 feet had been attained. The working level, or the working
depth, means that to which many roots penetrate and at which much
absorption must occur.</p>
<p>  The thorough occupancy of even the surface 3 inches
of soil and the competition of the roots between the 42-inch rows
may be plainly seen. The lax, meandering course of the longer
main roots of the adventitious or secondary root system was such
as to ramify the soil completely from the surface to directly
beneath the plant. These strong, tough roots were 3 to 4 millimeters
in diameter at their origin and maintained a diameter of 1.5 to
2 millimeters to their tips. They were extremely well branched.
Only the 3 to 5 inches of the rapidly growing root ends were free
from branches. The branches were usually most numerous and often
longest throughout the first few feet of their course. Here they
were frequently distributed 18 to 25 per inch, but they were profuse
throughout, <i>i.e.,</i> 8 to 12 per inch. All of the branches
are not shown in the drawing. These were variable in length, the
usual length of the shorter ones ranging from 0.2 to 2 inches.
But branches 6 inches to 2 to 3 feet long were also common. The
shorter rootlets were often unbranched, but longer ones (mostly
those over 1 inch in length) were rebranched with 20 branches,
0.1 to 1 inch long, per inch. These longer sublaterals were again
rebranched. Often the larger branches on the main roots were 1
to 1.5 millimeters thick and branched like the main root. Thus,
dense masses of roots and rootlets ramified the soil.</p>
<p>  The root network was especially dense within a
radius of 6 to 10 inches from the plant. Here, in addition to
the older roots, new surface roots were formed. For example, one
of these only 7.5 inches long was 5 millimeters thick. It tapered-to
a tip 2 millimeters in diameter. There was a total of 63 branches,
many of which were profusely rebranched as shown in Fig. 5; 33
roots of this general type were found near the base of the plant,
and some actually had 40 branches per inch! Some aerial roots,
as yet without branches, extended 2 to 4 inches into the rootfilled
soil. All of the surface roots were very turgid and brittle. In
fact, the denseness and abundance of the rapidly growing roots
can scarcely be overemphasized.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>  <b>Maturing Plants.</b>--Late in August a final
examination was made. The plants had an average height of 5.3
feet; some stalks were 6.5 feet tall. The leaves had not increased
in average size but there were more of them owing to the development
of the tillers, some of which were now as large as the parent
plant. Only a few of the basal leaves had deteriorated and the
plants were in good condition. The one selected for detailed study
had five stalks and seven ears. The kernels were well filled but
the husks were only beginning to dry.</p>
<p>  The root system had developed proportionately to
the tops. Branchlets extended to the root tips and indicated that
growth was practically complete. The surface area delimited at
the former examination (approximately 3 feet on all sides of the
plant) had not been greatly extended, but the soil volume, of
which this was one end, had been greatly extended in depth. A
working level of 50 inches was found and numerous roots ended
between 60 and 68 inches, which was the maximum depth.</p>
<p>  After continued study a typical plant was selected
and its root system worked out in the usual manner. A total of
78 main roots (<i>i.e.,</i> roots of large diameter, 3.5 millimeters
or more) arose from the base of this plant and 123 smaller ones.
Those of the latter group ranged from 0.5 to 2 millimeters thick.
Nine of the large main roots extended outward 18 to 42 inches
from the base of the plant in the surface soil and then, turning
downward, reached depths of 3 to 5 feet. Twenty-five main roots
(20 to 30 on other plants) extended outward only a short distance
from the base of the plant or, more usually, ran obliquely downward
in such a manner that even at their ends (at depths of 3.5 to
5 feet) they were only 12 to 18 inches from a vertical line from
the base of the plant. Figure 4 shows that some of these more
vertically descending roots were half grown at the earlier examination.
But many more of them had developed at this time. The remainder
of the large roots consisted of prop roots and others with a large
diameter (not infrequently 5 millimeters) which mostly extended
only a short distance, usually not over 12 inches, from the base
of the plant.</p>
<p>  As regards the remaining very numerous but smaller
roots, these extended outward almost entirely in the surface foot
of soil. Here they ended at distances of 3 to 24 inches from the
base of the plant. Thus, the surface soil, especially the first
10 inches and within a radius of 9 inches from the crown, was
filled with a dense tangle of roots, a network so complex and
so profuse that there seemed actually to be more roots than soil.
Certainly no moisture could evaporate from this soil volume. Indeed
it seems many more roots were present than were necessary to exhaust
it of its water and readily available nutrients! Figure 6 shows
a surface view of this root complex, the soil having been removed
and the roots exposed to a depth of 12 inches.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><font size="-1"><img align="BOTTOM" border="0" height="340" naturalsizeflag="3" src="http://soilandhealth.org/wp-content/uploads/01aglibrary/010137veg.roots/fig6.jpg" width="432"/></font></p>

  corn found in the 12 inches of surface soil. They are shown in

</blockquote>
<p>  As regards degree of branching, it was indeed profuse.
On the main, long, widely spreading roots, laterals occurred as
before at the rate of 8 to 12 branches per inch, but 30 branches
per inch were not uncommon. Even at depths of 4 feet or more 5
to 10 short branches per inch were usual. The branches, moreover,
were, in general, longer than at the earlier examination; in fact
long branches (over 5 inches) were much more numerous, and the
network of branches due to rebranching much more profuse. Similar
branching occurred on the long, rather vertically descending main
roots, but these, like the others, were less profusely branched
below 3 feet. From the tough, yellowish, cord-like roots many
long branches filled the soil. Some of these in the deeper soil
were quite yellow in color. Branching of the finer surface laterals
occurred at the rate indicated in the drawing. Here also the length
of the branches and their degree of rebranching are shown in detail.</p>
<p>  If one can visualize the root system of the sweet-corn
plant, he will see the surface 12 inches of soil near the plant
filled with a tangled root mass even to within 1 inch of the soil
surface. Extending beyond this to distances of 18 to 42 inches,
main horizontal roots pursue their course. From these long branches
extend into the deeper soil and finally the main roots themselves
turn downward and penetrate deeply. Below the 10-inch level, roots
are still abundant, but not so dense, until the working level
at 50 inches is reached. Still deeper roots are fewer but occasionally
occur at a depth of 68 inches. The main vertical roots penetrating
downward, spreading 12 inches or more on all sides of a vertical
line from the base of the plant, go thoroughly fill the soil that
in comparison there seems to be more or less of a gap between
this soil volume and that so completely occupied by the main horizontal
ones. In some plants this is less pronounced since, as in field
corn, the roots spread at wider angles and thus thoroughly occupy
this portion of the soil volume.</p>
<p>  <b>Summary.</b>--Sweet corn is an important vegetable
crop. The primary root system, unlike that of field corn, usually
consists of a single, much-branched root. During the first few
weeks this grows outward and downward over 1 inch a day. The secondary
root system consists of numerous horizontally spreading roots
which arise from the nodes of the stem just beneath the soil surface.
The roots are so profusely furnished with laterals that the absorbing
area; exceeds the area of the tops. In rather dry soil the absorbing
surface is much greater than in soil that is more moist. Plants
only in the eighth-leaf stage have from 7,000 to 10,000 branches.
At the time of tillering both the primary and secondary root systems
are still vigorously growing. The root system is composed of about
100 thick, coarse roots, about a third of which have just commenced
growth, and approximately one-third as many finer ones. They spread
3 feet on all sides of the plant and thoroughly occupy the soil,
interlacing between the rows, and reach a working depth of 2 feet.
Maturing plants show 6 inches greater lateral spread and the soil
is ramified to a depth of 5 feet. Thus, over 180 cubic feet of
soil are occupied by the roots of a single plant. Branching is
profuse, 8 to 30 long, much rebranched laterals occurring per
inch of main root. Briefly, sweet-corn roots extend laterally
more than half as far as the stalk extends upward, and the root
depth is equal to the height of this rather imposing vegetable
crop.</p>
<p>  <b>Comparison with Roots of Field Corn.</b>--The
root system of sweet corn is very similar to that of field corn.
Field corn is usually of larger stature, has a greater lateral
spread (often 3.5 feet on all sides of the plant), and penetrates
more deeply, usually to 5 and sometimes to 8 feet. This deeply
rooting habit has been observed in Nebraska, <font size="-2">174</font>
Colorado <font size="-2">68</font> Kansas, <font size="-2">105</font>
Wisconsin, <font size="-2">80</font> Illinois, <font size="-2">58</font>
and New York. <font size="-2">2</font> That it is greatly modified
by irrigation, <font size="-2">68</font> drainage <font size="-2">32</font>
fertilizers, etc. has also been ascertained.<font size="-2"> 104,
78, 50</font> The root system of sweet corn is so similar to that
of field corn and the plants are so closely related that it is
believed that similar modifications of the soil environment would
induce like responses in root development.</p>
<p>  Further investigations will undoubtedly show that
different varieties exhibit differences in rooting habit. Such
information is of great scientific and practical value. For example,
it has been shown that inbred strains of field corn differ greatly
in the character and extent of their root systems. "Certain
strains . . . have such a limited and inefficient root system
that they are unable to function normally during the hot days
of July and August, when the soil moisture is low."<font size="-1"> </font><font size="-2">58 </font>Different strains
show differences in resistance and susceptibility to root rot.
It has further been shown that, in general, weak-rooted strains
when compared with better-rooted ones, are more likely to lodge
and give a lower yield of grain.<font size="-1"> </font><font size="-2">81</font> This is due in part to being more susceptible
to injury from unfavorable environment and in part to parasitic
factors.<font size="-2"> 58</font> Experimental evidence has also
been found which supports the suggestion that selective absorption
by individual corn plants may prove to be a very important heritable
character.<font size="-2"> 56, 57</font> The relation of the root
habits to cultural practices in growing the crops of sweet and
field corn are practically identical.</p>
<p>  <b>Relation of Root Habits to Crop Production.--</b>A
study of the root habit clearly shows why corn does best on a
deep, well-drained soil which has an abundant and uniform supply
of water throughout the growing season.</p>
<p>  <i>Cultivation.</i>--If the soil is well prepared
before planting, the main benefits of cultivation are derived
from keeping down weeds, preventing the crusting of the surface,
and keeping the soil receptive to rainfall. The superficial position
of the roots clearly shows why deep cultivation is harmful. Fortunately,
weeds are most easily destroyed when coming through the surface
of the soil by shallow cultivation such as harrowing surface-planted
corn. This also breaks the soil crust, gives a drier and warmer
soil, and a more vigorous crop results. Thorough preparation of
the seed bed and shallow cultivation make a good combination.
The harmful effect of letting weeds grow for a time is not entirely
due to rapid removal of water and plant-food material by them
from the soil but to the breaking of the corn roots in the deeper
cultivation necessary for weed eradication.</p>
<p>  On heavy soils, however, a slight benefit from
cultivation other than weed control may be gained by better aeration.
As the oxygen supply in the soil air is decreased, rate of growth
diminishes in a soil with a high temperature.<font size="-2">
22</font> For example, corn roots, in a soil atmosphere of 96.4
per cent nitrogen and only 3.6 per cent oxygen, at a temperature
of 30°C. grow about one-third as rapidly as at the same temperature
under normal conditions of aeration. But at 18°C., growth
is increased to about two-thirds the normal rate at that temperature
when the soil is well aerated.<font size="-2"> 21</font> When
one considers, the enormous mass of respiring roots, it is clear
why an abundant air supply is needed.<font size="-2"> 27</font>
But in most soils the air is changed naturally by diffusion, displacement,
renewal due to rains, etc.</p>
<p>  An examination of the half-grown root system explains
why late tillage, except for weed eradication, is of little value.
The roots are so well distributed through the soil that little
moisture will escape even from uncultivated land. Hilling at the
last cultivation not only acts as a mechanical support to the
stem but also encourages the development of brace roots which
are an additional aid in holding the plant up against strong winds.
But, if hilled early, later cultivation partly removes the hill
and exposes a portion of the root system. Even shallow cultivation
cuts many of the roots and deep cultivation is very harmful and
greatly decreases the yield. Cultivation of field corn to a depth
of 4 inches during a period of 9 years in Ohio gave a decreased
yield every season but one, as compared with similar cultivation
to a depth of 1.5 inches. The average decrease per acre was 4
bushels of grain and 183 pounds of fodder.<font size="-2"> 179</font>
In Indiana, very similar results have been obtained.<font size="-2">
90</font> In Missouri, deep cultivation compared with shallow
reduced the yield 6.5 to 13 bushels per acre.<font size="-2">
166, 54</font> The harmful effects of deep cultivation are always
more pronounced during years of drought. In Illinois where the
roots were pruned to a depth of 4 inches at a distance of 6 inches
from the hill, the yield was decreased 17 bushels per acre.<font size="-2"> 109, 181</font> During a period of 8 years, the average
yield of corn in a cultivation experiment in Illinois was 39.2
bushels on plats cultivated three times; 45.9 bushels where no
cultivation was given but where the weeds were kept down by scraping
with the hoe; and 7.3 bushels per acre on plats where the weeds
were allowed to grow.<font size="-2"> 109</font> When the plants
begin to shade the ground, wind movement is reduced, evaporation
is decreased, and the thick network of roots near the surface
absorbs the water and prevents its escape into the air.</p>
<p>  As a result of a series of cooperative experiments
carried on in 28 states during a period of 6 years, it has been
found that as large yields of grain were gotten by keeping down
the weeds by cutting them at the surface of the soil without forming
a mulch as by cultivation.<font size="-2"> 25</font> Further analysis
of these findings showed that in subhumid or semiarid sections
the average yield from the uncultivated land was only 85.9 per
cent of that from the cultivated. Thus, the greater need for cultivation
in such sections, compared to humid ones, is illustrated. The
yields without cultivation, moreover, were found to be relatively
higher on sandy loams and silt loams than on clays or clay loams.
A difference of 13 per cent was determined between the sandy loams
and clays. <font size="-2">109</font> For the highest yields,
cultivation should never be deep enough to injure the roots seriously.
They should be allowed fully to occupy the richest portion of
the soil, which is usually the furrow slice. The proper type of
cultivation is one which is deep enough to kill the weeds but
shallow enough to reduce root injury to a minimum.</p>
<p>  <b>Fertilizers.</b>--Hill fertilizing of corn promotes
more vigorous early vegetative development with earlier tasseling
and earing. The observation of farmers that corn fertilized in
the hill sometimes suffers more from drought than when grown in
soil where the fertilizer has been uniformly distributed may be
explained by a study of root extent in relation to tops. Although
no differences were found in the actual abundance, depth, or lateral
spread of the roots, the more luxuriant plants resulting from
hill fertilizing had a relatively smaller root system.<font size="-2">
104</font> This may also explain why, in Missouri, applying fertilizer
in the hill or row yields good returns during seasons of abundant
rainfall, but in dry seasons there is more danger that the fertilizer
may cause the corn to "fire" than when it is applied
ahead of the planter with a fertilizer drill.<font size="-2">
54</font> Because of the extensive development of the roots of
practically all cultivated plants, it seems probable that the
chief effect of hill manuring is to promote vigorous early growth
and that the plant receives little benefit from the manure at
the time it is completing its growth and maturing its seed.</p>
<p>  Experiments have shown that corn absorbs nitrates
and undoubtedly other nutrients at all depths to which the roots
penetrate.<font size="-2"> 174</font> Competition for water and
nutrients from the interlacing roots of plants in the same hill
or in adjacent rows is often very severe. These root relations
should be considered in the rate of planting especially on less
favorable soils and in dry climates.</p>
<p>  <i>Suckering.</i>--The removal of suckers or tillers
from the base of the sweet-corn plant is a very old practice,
formerly followed to a greater extent than it is today. It has
been largely discontinued in field-corn culture. Experiments in
Nebraska<font size="-2"> 98,107</font> and Missisippi<font size="-2">
117</font> have conclusively shown that it materially decreases
the yield. The practice is not followed by a large per cent of
sweet-corn growers. Experiments at Ithaca, N. Y., during a period
of 5 years, show that the removal of the suckers does not accomplish
the results usually claimed for this practice, <i>viz.,</i> increase
of yield, larger yield of high-grade ears, larger size of ear,
and earlier and more even maturity. Golden Bantam, which suckers
or tillers rather freely, and Stowell's Evergreen, which produces
relatively few suckers, were used in the experiments.<font size="-2">
159</font> The data for the 5-year average show a reduced yield
from removing the suckers, the greatest reduction occurring when
they were removed at the beginning of tasseling. The results show,
moreover, that removing the suckers reduces the yield of stover,
a valuable by-product. "Under most conditions the practice
of suckering is not justified and is more likely to result in
loss than in gain. The later the suckering, the greater is the
chance for loss."<font size="-2"> 159</font> An examination
of Figs. 4 and 6 will make clear that this is quite what might
be expected. The larger the sucker at the time of removal the
more the balance between roots and stalks would be upset and also
