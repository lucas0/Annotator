                Everyone's favorite family of superheroes is back in "Incredibles 2"--but this time Helen (voice of Holly Hunter) is in the spotlight, leaving Bob (voice of Craig T. Nelson) at home with Violet (voice of Sarah Vowell) and Dash (voice of Huck Milner) to navigate the day-to-day heroics of "normal" life. It's a tough transistion for everyone, made tougher by the fact that the family is still unaware of baby Jack-Jack's emerging superpowers. When a new villain hatches a brilliant and dangerous plot, the family and Frozone (voice of Samuel L. Jackson) must find a way to work together again--which is easier said than done, even when they're all Incredible.

                        Brad Bird not only directs with the same assured inventiveness he brought to The Incredibles (and Ratatouille, and The Iron Giant), but has written a script every bit as smart, witty and touching as the first.

                        Incredibles 2 regresses to a time when any power women managed to acquire was carefully controlled so as not constitute a threat to the male order. Such nostalgia is self-defeating.

                        Incredibles 2 never justifies "why now" or tries to do more than make people who love their families despite life's frustration feel good. That doesn't prevent it from being a very fun, very good movie.

<div class="mop-audience-reviews__review--comment clamp clamp-4 js-clamp" data-clamp="true">Pixar continues sequelizing their hits with Incredibles 2, a fun and entertaining animated superhero film.  When tech mogul Winston Deavor sees the superhero family The Incredibles saving the city he makes them an offer to partner with them and use his resources to help them improve their public image and get the ban on superheroes repealed.  The animation is really crisp and colorful, and features a host of new superheroes with interesting character designs.  However, the plot is rather formulaic and predictable, but not entirely in a bad way.  Also, the comedy can be a little broad and slapstickly, yet it still delivers a lot of laughs and there are some clever bits of satire.  And, Michael Giacchino provides a pretty good score that compliments the tone and aesthetic of the film.  Ambitious and action-packed, Incredibles 2 is a worthy sequel to one of Pixar's landmark films.</div><div class="clamp-toggle-container"><a class="js-clamp-toggle clamp-toggle--show-more">Show More</a></div>

<div class="mop-audience-reviews__review--comment clamp clamp-4 js-clamp" data-clamp="true">I was happy to see The Incredibles return and for the better part is just as fun as the first film. The problem here is the timing and when the first strolled into cinemas in the early 00's it was a breath of fresh air, but now this is a very standard comic book movie storyline. It is interesting the story continues exactly where the first film ended, the voice acting has aged as it should have, but this is not explained with the timing of the story. The sequel could have focused on the extended time lost between movies. This doesn't deduct from the overall score, it's just my opinion. The issue here is relevance and in the market place, The Incredibles don't stand out from the pact. This made a lot of money and that is no shock as the original was successful, but didn't set the world on fire. The original film made a dent at home and that's where I caught the film and loved it from the first screening. This sequel attempts to capture lightening twice and it struggles to maintain the strength of the first film. The film does hit a point in the story where it gets really good and I feel the shift on Elastigirl is forced in the current climate. The sequel might not be the equivalent of the first, but it is still a lot of fun. 16/02/2019.</div><div class="clamp-toggle-container"><a class="js-clamp-toggle clamp-toggle--show-more">Show More</a></div>
