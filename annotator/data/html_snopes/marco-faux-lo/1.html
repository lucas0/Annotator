<div class="ArticleText">
            DR M. SABIESKI (PROFESSOR OF PHILOSOPHY)<blockquote>
<p>“The militant Muslim is the person cutting the head of the 
              infidel while the moderate Muslim holds the victims feet”. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>MARCO POLO (WORLD TRAVELER) </p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The law which their prophet Mohamed has given to muslims is 
              that any harm done to any one who does not accept their law and 
              any appropriation of his goods, is no sin at all.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>JOHN QUINCY ADAMS (U.S. PRESIDENT) </p>
<blockquote>
<p>”The essence of mohammed’s doctrine was violence and lust: to 
              exalt the brutal over the spiritual part of human nature.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>PROF BERTRAND RUSSELL (PHILOSOPHER) </p>
<p></p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Over a billion people believe in Allah without truly knowing 
              what Allah supposedly stands for or what he really demands of 
              them. And the minority that do understand continue to be Moslems 
              because they have redefined their morality and ethics to fit 
              within the teachings of Islam, which are floridly lacking in 
              morality. They therefore redefine what is good and evil in order 
              to fit their lives into what is preached by Islam, instead of 
              examining Islam to see if it fits within the good life. Backwards 
              thinking, imposed by a backward religion”. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>SIR WINSTON CHURCHILL (BRITISH PRIME MINISTER)</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote>
<p>"How dreadful are the curses which Mohammedanism lays on its 
              votaries! Besides the fanatical frenzy, which is as dangerous in a 
              man as hydrophobia in a dog, there is this fearful fatalistic 
              apathy. Improvident habits, slovenly systems of agriculture, 
              sluggish methods of commerce, and insecurity of property exist 
              wherever the followers of the Prophet rule or live. A degraded 
              sensualism deprives this life of its grace and refinement; the 
              next of its dignity and sanctity. The fact that in Mohammedan law 
              every woman must belong to some man as his absolute property - 
              either as a child, a wife, or a concubine - must delay the final 
              extinction of slavery until the faith of Islam has ceased to be a 
              great power among men.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>ALEXIS DE TOCQVILLE (FRENCH THINKER/HISTORIAN) </p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I studied the Kuran a great deal … I came away from that study 
              with the conviction that by and large there have been few 
              religions in the world as deadly to men as that of Muhammed.” </p>
</blockquote>
<p>EARNEST RENAN (FRENCH THINKER) </p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Muslims are the first victims of Islam. Many times I have 
              observed in my travels that fanaticism comes from a small number 
              of dangerous men who maintain others in the practice of this 
              religion by terror. To liberate the Muslim from his religion is 
              the best service that one can render him.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>WILL DURANT (U.S. HISTORIAN) </p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The Islamic conquest of India is probably the bloodiest story 
              in history. It is a discouraging tale, for its evident moral is 
              that civilization is a precious good, whose delicate complex of 
              order and freedom, culture and peace, can at any moment be 
              overthrown by barbarians invading from without or multiplying 
              within.” </p>
</blockquote>
<p>KOENRAAD ELST (BELGIAN HISTORIAN)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The Muslim conquests, down to the 16th century, were for the 
              Hindus a pure struggle of life and death. Entire cities were burnt 
              down and the populations massacred, with hundreds of thousands 
              killed in every campaign, and similar numbers deported as slaves. 
              Every new invader made (often literally) his hills of Hindus 
              skulls. As a contribution to research on the quantity of the 
              Islamic crimes against humanity, we may mention that the Indian 
              (subcontinent) population decreased by 80 million between 1000 
              (conquest of Afghanistan) and 1525 (end of Delhi Sultanate).” </p>
</blockquote>
<p>POPE BENEDICT/BYZANTINE EMPEROR PALEOGUS </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Show me just what Prophet Muhammad brought that was new, and 
              there you will find things only evil and inhuman, such as his 
              command to spread by the sword the faith he preached.” </p>
</blockquote>
<p>BRIGITTE GABRIEL (WRITER) </p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Islamic societies are suffocated by shackles around the human 
              spirit and brain. Islamic theology is driven by machoism, 
              dominance, intolerance, submission and violence to all that 
              disagrees with Islam’s principles of law”: </p>
</blockquote>
<p>DR. KHUSHWANT SINGH (PROFESSOR) </p>
<p></p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The most successful lecherous man who used religion for his 
              personal gain is Prophet Mohammed. Islam is a cult with it’s 
              complete irrational belief in Allah created by Muhammed who was a 
              liar, thief, murderer and rapist till his last breath”. </p>
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>Dr. R. BRAHAMCHARI (PHYSICIST) </p>
<blockquote>
<p>”Allah is a cruel tyrant, a barbaric killer and a violent 
              despot . Islamic Umma is the biggest criminal gang on earth and 
              Allah is leader and guide of that criminal gang and is trying to 
              establish himself as the God of the world (not of the universe) 
              with the help of the mujahidin through terror and bloodshed”. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dr. BR AMBEDKAR ( THE FATHER OF INDIAN CONSTITUTION) </p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Islam is a false and dangerous way of living.”</p>

</p><h3>Comment</h3><p>Great words of Eminent people. Nothing good has come of this religion and nothing good ever will. People who leave this religion can achieve something.muhammed was a beast throughout his life and even on his deathbed he wanted to kill only. No one has a good word for this beast and we need to show contempt only.</p>

</p><h3>Comment</h3><p>"Consider, for example, the Koran. This wretched book was sufficient to found a religion of the world, to satisfy the metaphysical need of innumerable millions of men for twelve hundred years, to become the foundation of their morality, and of [362 FIRST BOOK. CHAPTER XVII.] no small contempt for death, and also to inspire them to bloody wars and most extended conquests. We find in it the saddest and the poorest form of Theism. Much may be lost through the translations ; but I have not been able to discover one single valuable thought in it."  --------------------

</p><h3>Comment</h3><p>Great thinkers are unanimous about the sheer uncouth barbarity of islam.What do Zakir Naik,Akhter,Ahmed Deedat,etc .have to say to this ? India has seen the worst of islam through its history for nearly a thousand years and it culminated withe creation of Pakistan, and Pakistan is a failed State. Nothing good can ever come out of islam which is nothing but arabian cult of brutal barbarism and  a vehyicle to destroy human civilisation ! Nonarab muslims have become zombies, brainless stooges of arabians - virtual arab arse-lickers with no self respect for their own culture and tradition  and mindless submission to arab barbarism and hegemony. The zombies have become the greatest liabilty and casualty to civilisation ,peace , progress and prosperty and upholding of freedom of thought and speech and humanrights which are inalienable to achieve all this. Sooner the nonarab muslims realise the truth the better it is for humanity.</p>

</p><h3>Comment</h3><p>Gandhi was a politician who was trying to appease muslims.Why is it that whenever an infidel endorses islam either for political reason or out of pure ignorance all muslims get elated and excited and keep quoting him.Why are they so insecure? </p>

</p><h3>Comment</h3><p>Dear mr akhtar,
                i am born into a more austere and devout muslim family than perhaps  what you born into. i have had  most intimate and intuitive  exposure to islam with all its four mainstream school of thoughts as well as socio economic and socio political milieu of contemporary islam &lt; and have finished my study and experiance of so called ahmadi islam just now &gt;.
My quintessence of obtaining reality is that islam have its fair share of blameworthiness which in practical terms make it alsmost Non-reformable and Incorrigiable.
In my study of other relegions such as christanity , juiadasim, and hinduisam i find as much culpability but in case of islam, its crime against humanity and beastly deeds can never be detached from the holy quran and the shariat , the devine path,they are just camoflauged under different deceptive nomen-clatures and highly polarised value judgements. but all other relegions dont replicate this tactic , for whatever evil and obnoxiousness they carried can easily be declared as a dead past which can never be the case when it comes to islam.
MR akhtar i wish to have a one-to-one debate with you right on this foroum anytime later,if you will yourself enough not to perpetuate circular reasoning and instead be willing to make an exchange , not an excommunication.</p>

</p><h3>Comment</h3><p>Listen
You've read the article and seen that more than 70 million (to be conservative with the estimate) people in the indian subcontinent were massacred by the muslim thugs between the year 1000 and 1500. So, get your brain out of the sand Akhter and acknowledge how evil Islam is for a change? How long are you going to keep your head in the sand man? (this is Ibn Kammuna by the way). Peace everyone.</p>

</p><h3>Comment</h3><p>Allah made it clear in his book what was important to him and how he expected his submitters to respond to those directives. Mohammad provides the examples and is a role model. This is dar al-Islam...everything outside that, is dar al-harb. Most of the Quran and many ahadith are concerned with Islam fighting dar al-harb, who's residents are People of the book, Jews, Zoroastrians, atheists, Wiccans, and assorted filthy kuffars etc.
This jihad against everything non Islamic has been going on since Mohammad, millions have died because of it.
Everyone of those people above were right...

</p><h3>Comment</h3><p>Aktar nobody here are hating and intolerent like you.All here are not fond of any relgion.Yes all religions have drawbacks except the graet and practical relgion buddhism.As Einstien has said Religion has no future ,if at all there is it is buddhism.(i am not a born buddhist)I am not propagating buddhism.Buddhism itself attracts every rational and humane thinker.Remainig all religions have are not dangerius except islam.Yes once again .Enquire yourself impartially just hat you do in case of normal high school scinece and mathematics.you can surely know the truth provide you have minmal reasoning and dare to accet impartial truth.WE all get nothing in critising islam .Muslims are unfortunately trapped in it for paradise desires and for fear of imaginery hell.I once again say there is no saitan except your bad thought and desire.know the truth atleast by meditation</p>

</p><h3>Comment</h3><p>Excellent ayesah .these are very funny and informative too.Amebdkar has said hindusm is not good but islam is dangerous.He greatly propheised that muslims can not live in peace and tolencerent with hindus.Not only hindus but with any religion.The fault is not with but with their faith.No religion or people of other religion than islam can live and exist with islam.Partition of india will be disastrous and it will not the end.partion will continue till islam and muslims exists.Yes these are the golden words of the great genous whcih came true.Muslims population in india is grwin day and night and has doubled from 8% to 15%while hindus in pak are almost eliminated(1 or 2%) from 20% before partition.In bangladesh to they were either killed or convertedto islam resulting their population decline from 30% to 8% now.Al this is due to hate and and islam.Now indiam muslims(most of them) support pak and ISI and act aginst the mother country ,india and sobotise it economy through fake currrency and terrorism.They are betrying their own mother nation which is providing them food subsidies,jobs,and hundredos crores for exclusive religious tours like huj .But still they hate india and always want to cheat co indian citizens of remaing faith.They can know that betrying mother country is more worse than betrying mother just only due to islam</p>

</p><h3>Comment</h3><p> point out where i said this.my quintessense is that no relegion is holy grail.this article i myself didn,t write i found it and posted here.i think many non-muslim critique of islam dont have full and composit scholarly study of islam.there are many roboust rationalties in islam but it doesnt mean it is totaly unblemish. there is inhumanity ,and glaring double standards, hate and absurdities in this relegion which you cant get rid ofas against other faiths. this point i can prove in an intelectual and independant depate , but first stop being an irksome pest who just throw one selective ace argument and try to get the debate won on his side.</p>

</p><h3>Comment</h3><p>Ayesha, as always, great article !! I love this quote: "DR. KHUSHWANT SINGH (PROFESSOR): 'The most successful lecherous man who used religion for his personal gain is Prophet Mohammed. Islam is a cult with it’s complete irrational belief in Allah created by Muhammed who was a liar, thief, murderer and rapist till his last breath'”. Most of Islamic countries use the same way to gain power. Still they say Islam is a religion of peace. Ha ha ha .... only donkeys will believe that, ha ha ha ....

</p><h3>Comment</h3><p>surely it is not the first time islam is under attack. people has been doing it from the day it was first declared. either most you are only having names like muslims or you are those of "qadiyani group". nothing immpressive. just one question "if it is so bad of a religion so 'unhumanly' why according to your great F.B.I. report islam is the fastest growing relegion in U.S.A. a word of advice "barking dogs do change the path of caravans" grow up, its not going to work.</p>

</p><h3>Comment</h3><p>Islam claims to be the fastest growing. Muslims have more children ( in Yemen the average is 7).Muslim who convert or renounce their faith keep their mouths shut so they will not be shunned by family or killed. In Pakistan if you convert, all that has to be said is that you blasphemed or did something wrong to a Qu'ran and you will be beaten, killed, you land taken and your wife and daughters raped. So you keep your mouth shut and you worship whatever you want to in your heart. I never understood how somebody who does not profess to believe in something can blaspheme against it. Islam is then blaspemy to Christians and Jews. Those who know God and actually have a relationship with him know that there will be no Muslims on Earth in the next 25 years. Remember you lose the Gog Magog war. You get this for disrespecting Jews, Dogs, and breaking the first 3 COMMANDMENTS. Yahweh is God. Not Allah </p>

</p><h3>Comment</h3><p>                                            

On FFI,   a Muslim named “OneGod” wrote a great numbers of quotations from writers who seems to have said favorable things about Muhammad and Islam. He should be carefull to not quote out of context and out of the spirit in which it has been written. Here is an exemple : OneGod  brings these three quotations from Carlisle :
"A man of truth and fidelity, true in what he did, in what he speaks and thought - this is the only sort of speech worth speaking." -- [Sir Thomas Carlyle, British author]           ( This is the only sort of speech worth speaking ? Really ? Hitler was also this kind of man.)

 
"The word of Mohammad is a voice direct from nature’s own heart - all else is wind in comparison". -- [Thomas Carlyle]
"The lies that we (Christians) have heaped round this man (Muhammad) are disgraceful to ourselves only". -- [Thomas Carlyle]  (Humm…disgrace for telling facts as they are ? Carlisle, here, is lacking knowledge or ….judgement. )

"Here is a quotation from Carlisle from other source :
“The man was an uncultured semi-barbarous Son of Nature, much of the Bedouin still clinging to him: we must take him for that. But for a wretched Simulacrum, a hungry Impostor without eyes or heart . . . we will not and cannot take him. Sincerity, in all senses, seems to me the merit of the Koran; what had rendered it precious to the wild Arab men . . . Curiously, through these incondite masses of tradition, vituperation, complaint, ejaculation in the Koran, a vein of true direct insight, of what we might almost call poetry, is found straggling". [Carlyle 64-67] 
Carlisle does not say that Muhammad and Islam are a beacon for humanity, that Quran was” inimitable”. He does not invite Occident to become Muslims ! And I am absolutely sure he would not have liked to live under Sharia !  Carlisle did not judge Muhammad and Islam  from a moral point of vew but in term of heroïsm. Hitler was a hero too, a great man, eloquent, sincere, charismatic who had a great influence on the world but he was also a mad man. like Muhammad. An very “sincere” also ! 
Here is an other quotation :
“If I were in his presence, I would wash his feet.” -- [Hercules, the Great Roman Emperor]

Who knows this “Great Roman Emperor” ?   Very comic ! And I did know Muhammad lived under Roman Empire. 

Here is a quotation from  William Muir OneGod  cites .

“Mohammad brought an end to idol worship. He preached Monotheism and infinite Mercy of God, human brotherhood, care of the orphan, emancipation of slaves, forbidding of wine. No religion achieved as much success as Islam did.” -- [Sir William Muir, Scottish Orientalist]

Here is a qutation from Muir I cites :  “The sword of Muhammad and the Quran, are the most fatal ennemy of Civilisation, Liberty, and Truth, which the world has yet knonw.”  

In which quotation  Muir makes  a definitive jugement on Islam, do you think ? We must be carefull when we quote. If each quotations OneGod cites were carefully examined, there were not much left to really  praise Islam except deluded persons like Bucaille.   I must say that all quotations  cited by Ayesha are exact. These authors condemmed Islam globally  and without restrictions for what it is, a shame for humanity.
