<p class="cnnBodyText">Aired July 23, 2005 - 16:00   ET</p>
<p class="cnnBodyText">THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.</p>
<p class="cnnBodyText"><br/>     LISA SYLVESTER, CNN HOST:  Ahead this hour, another terror strike, this time at a popular resort city in Egypt.  We're live with the latest.<br/>     And new developments out of London.  Police say they got the wrong man.<br/> <br/>     Here in the U.S., the mercury is rising as the deadly heat wave continues.  Find out if relief is on the way.  <br/> <br/>     And then, a mother speaks out to her daughter's convicted killer. <br/> <br/>     ERIN RUNNION, SAMANTHA RUNNION'S MOTHER:  And she fought.  And I know she fought you.  I know she looked at you with those amazing brown eyes, and you still wanted to kill her.  <br/> <br/>     SYLVESTER:  Hello, and welcome to CNN LIVE SATURDAY.  I'm Lisa Sylvester, Fredricka Whitfield has the day off.  All that and more, after this check of the headlines.<br/> <br/>     Italian soccer team Inter Milan canceled its four-city tour of Britain today citing concerns over the terrorist bombings in London. Inter Milan would have played one match in London.  Its Website says it didn't want to stretch British security services.  <br/> <br/>     Much of the area around Tokyo was rattled by an earthquake today. A Japanese news agency reports more than two dozen people were injured in the magnitude 6.1 quake.  Buildings shook and flights and train service were suspended temporarily.  <br/> <br/>     Secretary of State Condoleeza Rice met with Palestinian leaders today, praising their efforts to clamp down on violent militants.  But Rice said there's still much work to be done as the deadline for Israel's withdrawal from Gaza and parts of the West Bank approaches.  <br/> <br/>     We begin today with the latest on the terror strikes in four countries.  Egyptian investigators now say 83 people were killed in Saturday's bombing in Sharm al Sheikh.  More than 200 people were wounded.  <br/> <br/>     Meanwhile, British officials are expressing regret over the death of a man killed by police investigating Thursday's failed bombings in London.  Police now say he was not connected to the incident.  <br/> <br/>     Spanish authorities arrested two people after a small bomb shook the city of Santiago de Compostela today.  Radical separatist groups are being blamed for the attack.<br/> <br/>     And two people were injured in Istanbul, Turkey, today, when a bomb exploded in a cafe.  Turkish police believe the device was either on a timer or remotely controlled.  <br/> <br/>     And now to the regret in London today, over the death of a man shot by police in the Stockwell area.  British authorities say he was the wrong man and not -- not involved in the attempted attacks.  Our senior international correspondent Nic Robertson is live in London with more -- Nic?  <br/> <br/>     NIC ROBERTSON, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Well, Lisa, we're hearing through Brazilian media that they believe the man that was shot on the train was, in fact, Brazilian.  We understand from the Brazilian Consulate here that they are contacting the police to find out that for a fact.  We don't know that it is being reported in Brazilian media.<br/> <br/>     The police say that it's deeply regrettable that this man was killed, but say they now know he was not connected with the bombings on the previous day, the failed bombing attempts.  They say the man was -- did come out of a building that they were watching, that they did send a surveillance team behind him as he went down the -- as he went towards the station.  The police say that they challenged him at the station, shouted a warning.  He ran off, according to the police. Eyewitnesses saw him jump over a ticket barrier.  And again, according to eyewitnesses, the three policemen chased him onto the train.  He tripped.  He fell.  The police then fired shots from a handgun and he was killed there on the train.<br/> <br/>     In this neighborhood, which is just a few miles away from where that shooting took place, the police are continuing their investigation in search for the four suspect bombers from that attempt, from those attempted bombings.  This area, in this housing area, police came in a few hours ago, armed police assisting police in protective clothing, went into a building just a little bit behind me. Residents here were told by police to stay inside their buildings. But police confirm that this investigation, this raid here, is part of their ongoing investigation into the attempted bombings just two days ago -- Lisa.  <br/> <br/>     SYLVESTER:  All right.  Nic Robertson reporting.  We appreciate that report.  <br/> <br/>     The latest attacks in London and the deadly blasts in Egypt have added to the anxieties here in the U.S.  Many commuters are seeing beefed-up security on subways and other forms of mass transit.  In New York, they're taking it all in stride.  Let's go live to our Susan Lisovicz -- Susan.  <br/> <br/>     SUSAN LISOVICZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Hi, Lisa.  You know The Atlantic Avenue Station is normally one of the busiest in the New York Transit System.  This is where the New York City Subway system intersects with Long Island Railroad.  That's one reason, perhaps, we saw a dozen heavily armed national guardsman arrive on the scene this morning.  In the words of one, to help keep commuters safe.  Meantime, the MTA tells us that several thousand searches have been conducted without incident.  The random searches that we've seen system wide. Something that we didn't even see in the immediate days following September 11.  Commuters we talked to had differing opinions on their effectiveness.  But say it's a harsh reminder of life post-9/11.  <br/> <br/>     (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)<br/> <br/>     UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I think if you're going to be traveling on public transport, that you have to expect that for the safety of everyone involved, that it's a good thing.  <br/> <br/>     UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I wouldn't give them no problem, but I would still feel a little offended.  Like why you picking me out?  But they've got to do what they've got to do, hey, I ain't going to give them no trouble.  <br/> <br/>     UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It's better to, like, have to like be a little late than to die.  <br/> <br/>     (END VIDEOTAPE)<br/> <br/>     LISOVICZ:  On Monday, the New Jersey Transit System will also start conducting random searches for the tens of thousands of commuters who come into New York every day.  The acting governor, Richard Codey, calls it a new level of vigilance, to keep New York commuters safe -- Lisa.<br/> <br/>     SYLVESTER:  And, Susan, we'll have to see how that Monday morning commute goes.  All right.  Susan, thank you very much.  <br/> <br/>     And stay with CNN for the most reliable coverage of news that affects your security.  Coming up in just a few minutes, we're going to take a closer look at who the terrorists are, why they attack innocent people, and why they hate the west so much.  It's a CNN security watch.  Stay with us for that.<br/> <br/>     But now, the heat.  Much of the U.S. is baking in a relentless heat wave that's pushing temperatures into the triple digits, in parts of the Midwest and south.  In St. Louis, police handed out water to hundreds of elderly residents who, along with young children, are especially vulnerable to heat illnesses.  In Chicago, residents are being warned stay inside during the hottest part of the day tomorrow when temperatures are expected to exceed 100.  And unbearably hot temperatures continue to plague some western states where 200 cities set daily record highs this week.  <br/> <br/>     To find out how long these sky-high temperatures are going to last, let's go to the CNN weather center and meteorologist Jacqui Jeras -- Jacqui.<br/> <br/>     JACQUI JERAS, CNN METEOROLOGIST:  Well, Lisa, it's going to last at least through the weekend.  And those of you who are seeing the nice conditions in the east today, don't get used to it, because this heat is going to be spreading your way by the early part of next week. A lot of people getting into that century club this weekend.  Denver, you're hitting it at this hour at 100.  We've got 94 in St. Louis. And 96 degrees in Dallas.<br/> <br/>     But it's not so much the temperature on the thermometer, but when you add in all the humidity, it makes it feel a lot worse.  So take a look at some of these heat index readings.  A hundred and thirteen at this hour in Des Moines, Iowa.  One hundred and eight in Omaha, Nebraska.  One-o-six at this time in Kansas City.  Chicago, looking for a high of only 88 degrees for today, but feeling well into the 90s.  Tomorrow, hitting the 100-degree mark.  It should be the hottest day of the year for you.  Good news is, heat relief in the way, in the middle of the week, down into the 80s.  Right now looking at 105 for your heat index in Oklahoma City.  Check out Little Rock at 101.  A hundred and five in Memphis at this hour.  One hundred in Mobile.  Not as bad in Atlanta at 94, but looking for a high on the thermometer tomorrow of 97, heat indices well into the triple digits for tomorrow.<br/> <br/>     High temperatures for tomorrow afternoon, 102 in St. Louis. There's that 100 in Chicago.  Ninety in Washington, D.C. Ninety nine in Dallas.  And 97 in Atlanta.  Heat also persists across the southwest.  Temperatures down just a little bit here, but the humidity will be on the increase.  Showers and thunderstorms expected all across the four corners.  And we'll see maybe a little bit of relief across parts of the west later on in the week.  We got a little cold front trying to make its way across the Pacific Northwest at this time.  And we've got high pressure bringing in a nice northerly flow into the northeast, and that's why you folks are out of the real hot stuff for today.  But that's going to slide eastward for tomorrow and as we head into Monday and Tuesday.  It will be pretty unbearable. New York City, Philadelphia and Washington, D.C.<br/> <br/>     Also want to keep a quick eye on what's going on in the tropics. We've got Tropical Storm Franklin out there, 70-mile-per-hour winds. And right now, it looks like it should be heading up to the north and into the east and staying away from the United States.  So certainly some good news there.  With Franklin, it could reach hurricane strength, we think, by tomorrow morning.  And it looks like we may have TD number seven ,tropical depression developing in Campeche Bay. And we'll have more updates on that, after five o'clock Eastern time -- Lisa.  <br/> <br/>     SYLVESTER:  So the northeast is going to have to brace itself. Thank you very much.  Thanks, Jacqui.<br/> <br/>     And now, back to our top story.  Terror in Egypt where 83 people were killed after a series of bombings.  Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak today surveying the destruction and condemning the bombings at Sharm al Sheikh.  He vows the attacks will only strengthen Egypt's effort to fight terror.  Our Jon Vause joins us on the phone, now from Sharm al Sheikh.  John, what can you tell us.<br/> <br/>     JOHN VAUSE, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Well, Lisa, it seems in many ways, this resort town is back to how it was less than 24 hours after those attacks.  It was much like this night last (INAUDIBLE) when the bombers struck three different attacks on this resort town.  One of those attacks was caught on home video.<br/> <br/>     Now, we have pictures, I think, of some of the -- of the attack taken by a Polish tourist not far from the old market.  There authorities say a suicide car bomber detonated near a coffee shop.  At least 17 Egyptian workers were killed there.  A minute before that attack, there was another attack at the Ghazala Gardens Hotel.  That explosion ripped apart that hotel.  Now the surge at the hotels and at the three different bomb sites continue, even at this late hour, the authorities are trying to find who may be responsible for this, who may have carried out the attack on the city, which calls itself the city of peace -- Lisa.<br/> <br/>     SYLVESTER:  Very tragic indeed.  Thank you very much, John Vause, for that report.<br/> <br/>     Well, just how dangerous is the summer heat?  Later I'll get some tips for coping with the rising temperatures from a medical expert.  <br/> <br/>     Also, a filmmaker who documented the stories of potential suicide bombers, tells us what drives their violent act.  <br/> <br/>     Next, what makes the newest generation of bombers so dangerous? Some answers from an expert on Islamist terrorism.  <br/> <br/>     (COMMERCIAL BREAK)<br/> <br/>     SYLVESTER:  More now from London.  One of the world's mightiest cities targeted twice in two weeks by coordinated teams of terrorists. Is Britain under siege?  Joining us now live from London, terrorism expert, Sajjan Gohel.  He is director for international security at the London-based Asia Pacific Foundation.  So are we seeing a shift with the London terrorist bombings with Europe now becoming the battleground?  <br/> <br/>     SAJJAN GOHEL, ASIA PACIFIC FOUNDATION:  Very much so.  Before Europe, particularly the UK, had become a playground for the terrorists, a place of staging operations and executing them abroad. For example you had the Hamburg cell that took part in the 9/1 atrocity.  And of course, it had been no secret that British officials, particularly of Pakistani origin, had gone abroad for terrorist activities.  But this time, this was devastatingly new and worrying, these individuals born and brought up in the society they live in decided to launch a devastating mass casualty atrocity.  And of course, the fear is that this is just the beginning, that there could be more.  It was set with the Madrid train bombings last year, now London, and what else is, of course, the big question.  <br/> <br/>     SYLVESTER:  Do you think Thursday's attempted attack was planned by the same network of people that orchestrated the July 7th bombings or two separate groups?  <br/> <br/>     GOHEL:  Well, what we have to look at is past attacks.  If you take the Istanbul attacks in November of 2003, you had the Jewish synagogues hit.  A week later other (ph) interests was hit again in the same city with the British consulate and a bank.  In Madrid, the bombers were intending to hit other interests like the Real Madrid soccer stadium.  And what we see with terrorists is they like to carry out follow-up attacks to keep the wounds, the memories of the previous atrocity fresh in the mind, keep their horror etched in our memory, keep it alive.  And it is worrying that this could have well been connected to the previous attack.  They seem to be different cells, but ultimately going to carry out the same type of attack which was coordinated multiple and hitting at the transportation system.  <br/> <br/>     SYLVESTER:  People have talked a lot about the July 7th attack. It seemed very well planned.  It went off as executed.  The Thursday attack did not.  Does that suggest maybe a copycat, even though they might be affiliated with the same group of individuals, but still a copycat?  <br/> <br/>     GOHEL:  Well, it needed a lot of preparation and timing.  This couldn't have been assembled spontaneously or so soon after the July 7th attacks.  I think we're very fortunate, very lucky, because the explosive material that was used in the attacks just a few days ago had actually degraded.  It had deteriorated.  And therefore, its potency had been completely weakened.  Had the material been stronger like the July 7th, we would have seen as devastating atrocity, and that would have been, of course, catastrophic.  But the bombers made a key mistake.  They didn't check their devices properly, and now the authorities have been able to get their hands on a fully assembled bomb.  We'll be able to trace how these individuals put it together, perhaps where they purchased some of the material, and it could lead to other cells that have been planning attacks inside the UK.  <br/> <br/>     SYLVESTER:  Is it your sense that the war in Iraq is driving this latest round of violence, or in other words, is Britain being punished, essentially, for helping the U.S.?  <br/> <br/>     GOHEL:  Well, there's been this huge debate as to whether, because of Iraq, that countries like Spain and the UK have been hit. But I think we've got to turn that around a bit.  It's got to be looked into a bit more.  The UK is being targeted because it is trying to rebuild the country.  They are targeting countries that are part of the process of turning Iraq around, getting it back on its feet, rebuilding the nation, getting it over the past of the Saddam Hussein dictatorship.  And of course, countries that are in that process will always be targeted, because they want it, the insurgents that is and their affiliates throughout the world, because they're all bonded by the same goals and ideologies, they want to undermine the presence in Iraq.  They want to turn it into a cesspool, another Talibanized Afghanistan.  And of course, they know nothing better than to hitting countries that have actually been contributing and trying to give the Iraqis a better opportunity in life.  <br/> <br/>     SYLVESTER:  In terms of preventing future attacks, and even looking backwards, are we seeing a failure, though, somehow in western intelligence, that they weren't able to pick up or to have prevented these attacks beforehand?  <br/> <br/>     GOHEL:  Well, it's a very important question.  And what we're seeing is it's very difficult for the authorities to have 100 percent success rate on intelligence.  At the most, they can probably do 99 percent.  And unfortunately, that one percent failure can result in a mass casualty atrocity.  The terrorists just need to be successful once.  They wait for opportunities to strike.  And that is the challenge, is that how do you identify an enemy that is entrenched into civilian society, that can't be identified by uniform.  People that lead normal lives, normal jobs, but they get the green light, the message to carry out an attack and then they reappear at a time of their choosing.  And of course, the fact that all these individuals have been trained in Pakistan is, of course, another major concern.  <br/> <br/>     SYLVESTER:  And the challenge also is, how do we fight the extremists.  Your thoughts on that?  <br/> <br/>     GOHEL:  Well, it's got to be looked at in a different number of fronts.  Of course, hunting down and killing and capturing terrorists is important.  But what we're seeing is that these guys are simply being replaced.  The terror cells are able to replenish their ranks. We need to look at two things, one, is the recruitment of terrorists, we've got to stop the flow.<br/> <br/>     For example, the religious schools in Pakistan, they're indoctrinating individuals, turning them into hard-core militants, telling them to hate the west.  That has to be stopped.  General Musharraf has to do a lot more than he's been doing to stop that.  And also we have to kill the idea, the fundamentalist doctrine that Bin Laden has preached, that they're disseminating throughout the world. You have to challenge the ideas, the evil ideology that is basically influencing these young impressionable Muslims.  That has to be done. If we can tackle that, we can arrest a problem that has been existing for a long time.  But this war on terrorism is not a short thing.  The Cold War took some 50 years.  This is not going to be any shorter, I'm afraid.  We have to prepare for the long term.  <br/> <br/>     SYLVESTER:  OK. Thank you very much, Sajjan Gohel, thank you very much for joining us with your thoughts and insights.  <br/> <br/>     GOHEL:  My pleasure.  <br/> <br/>     SYLVESTER:  Coming up, what drives a suicide bomber to give up his or her life?  Next, I'll talk with a filmmaker who has spent time with those who would kill themselves for their cause.<br/> <br/>     (COMMERCIAL BREAK)<br/> <br/>     SYLVESTER:  At this hour, police in London are searching for a team of failed bombers.  In the midst of a rash of suicide attacks, a question.  Why do people surrender their lives to kill innocent strangers.  Why?  These are the words of suicide attackers whose operations failed and their close family members.  They spoke with producer Pierre Rehov for his chilling documentary, "Suicide Killers."  Pierre is our guest now, and he joins us from New York.  So, Pierre, what inspired you to produce "Suicide Killers."  This is your seventh film.  <br/> <br/>     PIERRE REHOV, FILMMAKER:  Actually, I was going to make a film about the victims of terror, and I ended up talking to people who were absolutely paralyzed by the remembering of the very minute when they saw the suicide bomber doing -- I mean, doing his killing.  The guys had a little smile on their face, at the very second when they blew themselves up.  So I compiled together the idea of getting close to the victims and going to the people who did that.  And I got very deeply into this situation, because I spent a lot of time with a lot of suicide bombers in jail, in Israeli jails.  And then I went to the territories and I talked to some families of suicide bombers.<br/> <br/>     So I ended up going deeply -- more and more deep in their psychology, and there is a very scary thing in this psychopathology of the suicide bombers, because basically you are talking to young kids who can be just normal young kids anywhere else in the world.  But they so strongly believe in Allah, and they so strongly believe in what is going to be the afterlife.  But they end up having a kind of neurosis, which leads them to having no other choice than killing themselves and killing other people in the name of Allah, and hoping that this is going to be the door open to a much better life.  <br/> <br/>     SYLVESTER:  They look just like, as you said, normal everyday teenagers and such.  Is there a typical profile, though, of a suicide bomber?  <br/> <br/>     REHOV:  Well most of them are, as you just said, Lisa, between 16 and 20 years old.  With a very strong libido in a society which doesn't allow any approach between men and women.  There is complete separation of men and women in the Islamic Muslim society.  Especially in the Palestinian territories, except for very few exceptions.  So we have really no other hope of having a normal life, except if you have -- are making enough money to end up being one day capable of buying, actually, a woman from the family.<br/> <br/>     And the only hope to have a normal life for them in this situation where we have this deep anxiety of life, with deep anxiety of sexuality, with deep anxiety of everything which would appear normal in the rest of the world.  The only solution for them is to experiment with delusional (INAUDIBLE) of absolute power, in which they are becoming beyond all kind of punishment, beyond the civilization, beyond humankind.  They are so close to God at the very second they do it they have this smile, that any victim, a survivor of a suicide bombing has been telling me about.  <br/> <br/>     SYLVESTER:  And you have your own theory, which you're alluding to, about why these young men decide to become suicide bombers, with sex as a central theme.  Can you explain a little bit more this theory, the idea of the virgins being promised in the afterlife?  <br/> <br/>     REHOV:  Well Islamic is the only religion which is describing heaven, paradise, in so concrete terms.  Among the -- in the other religions, you know, it's kind of vague.  But in Islam, you have this precise description of the women that you're going to have.  They will all be virgins, 72 of them.  Lakes of honey.  You can drink wine. Everything which is forbidden on Earth during this temporary existence.  According to some Imams, it's completely allowed in the afterlife.  So you end up having no other door to really enjoy life, than destroying your own, by doing what you think is the right thing, which is destroying impurity.<br/> <br/>     For these kids, everything which is not Islam is impure.  And they have to give their life in the name of Allah to be in Allah's world.  In other words, this is for them.  The only way to experiment an orgasm.       SYLVESTER:  Really briefly, were any of them sympathetic, any of the young men that you talked to?  Did they have any regrets, express any sense of remorse?  <br/> <br/>     REHOV:  They were all very unsympathetic.  Which is the most frightening part of the entire thing, because they have a logic which is their own, which is understandable when you talk to them.  Their notion of good and evil is completely different from ours.  And I was talking to one of the kids who was 16 years old, and he was telling me, if I had succeeded, my mother would have been very proud of me and she would have been very proud of me because I never drank alcohol and I never did anything bad in my life.  Meaning that killing children and women in an Israeli birth is okay, and drinking alcohol is not. And he was telling me at the end of the interview, as soon as I go out of jail, I'm going to try it once, twice, three times, but I'll finally succeed in being a martyr.  Which is the only way of being what we would be, you know, the dream of any kid in the entire world would be to be a fireman, or a policeman, or cowboy.  He wants to be a martyr, because this is the only way for him to become a hero.  <br/> <br/>     SYLVESTER:  OK.  We're going to have to end there.  Pierre Rehov, the man behind "Suicide Killers."  Thank you very much for that enlightening information.  <br/> <br/>     And coming up, find out how a dropped cell phone led police to a potential terror plot.<br/> <br/>     And summer is here, that means a lot of sweating.  We'll have some hot tips on avoiding anything worse.  Just ahead on CNN SATURDAY.<br/> <br/>     (COMMERCIAL BREAK)<br/> <br/>     SYLVESTER:  Our top stories.  Police in London express regret for the fatal shooting at a subway station.  They say the man police killed yesterday was not -- not -- related to the recent spate of bomb attacks.  Today an armed police unit mounted a raid in South London after a second man was arrested in connection with the failed attacks Thursday.<br/> <br/>     A stronger role for the FBI in the search for Natalee Holloway. An FBI official says authorities in Aruba have agreed to show agents interrogation records and other related materials.  But the FBI still is barred from questioning potential suspects or witnesses.<br/> <br/>     And Lance Armstrong pours it on at the Tour de France.  Armstrong finished first today in the race's next-to-last stage.  And he stretched his mammoth lead to more than 4 1/2 minutes.  He's almost assured a seventh consecutive Tour de France victory as he ends his career tomorrow.<br/> <br/>     Now, back in the U.S, it's the weather that's making the headlines.  A blistering heat wave is blanketing much of the country, sending temperatures soaring into the triple digits.  With more, here's CNN's Catherine Callaway.<br/> <br/>     (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)     CATHERINE CALLAWAY, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Parts of Georgia are under a heat advisory this weekend and residents may see the hottest weather so far this year.<br/> <br/>     (voice-over):  In the Atlanta area, a number of people headed here to centennial park to cool off in the park's water fountains. Children and adults running through the water for a quick respite from the heat that is gripping many parts of the country.  But some are thinking about their loved ones, unable to get out of their homes to find relief from the heat.<br/> <br/>     UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  My mother doesn't have air conditioning at her house.  But I call her every morning to make sure she's all right and just to remind her to drink water, to stay in the shade and just come over if she gets too overheated.<br/> <br/>     CALLAWAY:  In St. Louis, police organized a heat beat to check in on senior citizens; going door to door with hundreds of bottles of water to see if they were coping well with the rising temperatures and making sure their homes were cool during this heat wave.<br/> <br/>     UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I think it is so sweet.  I wouldn't move out of Pine Lawn for anything.<br/> <br/>     CALLAWAY:  In Chicago, with temperatures heading toward 100 degrees, officials are not only concerned about the elderly, but the Lollapalooza rockers partying in the sun.  The city has issued a heat warning and with the hottest weather expected tomorrow and the humidity, temperatures in the Windy City will feel like 115 degrees, the hottest weather in years.<br/> <br/>     To Kansas now, where authorities are concerned about furry friends, giving frozen treats at the Kansas City Zoo to the animals and free water to anyone over the age of three.  A heat advisory remains in effect in Kansas City, and all of Missouri.<br/> <br/>     (on camera):  With advisories popping up all around the country, officials are urging people to keep abreast of the dangerous temperatures and take the warnings seriously.  Catherine Callaway, CNN, Atlanta.<br/> <br/>     (END VIDEOTAPE)<br/> <br/>     SYLVESTER:  So, what's the best way to stay safe in temperatures that can be deadly?  For some answers, here's Dr. Bill Lloyd, who joins us now from Dallas, a city that's sizzling in near 100-degree heat.  So Dr. Lloyd, aside from a bad case of sunburn, how do the high temperatures stress our healthy bodies?<br/> <br/>     DR. BILL LLOYD, UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA DAVIS MEDICAL CENTER: Well, Lisa, every part of the body tries to help the body stay cool when the temperatures rise.  The body wants to increase the circulation just like the radiator in a car to make lots of perspiration to keep you cool.  That means organs like your kidneys which you normally wouldn't normally associate with high temperature may be stressed.  So people with high blood pressure or kidney problems have to be extra careful.  The same is true for the brain, the same is true for the heart, you've got to be extra careful when the temperatures rises.<br/> <br/>     SYLVESTER:  And a headache, I understand, could be one of the first signs of a heat related illness of some sort?<br/> <br/>     LLOYD:  Very, very important tip there, Lisa.  Especially in children who rarely complain of headaches.  If you've got a headache and the temperature's up, it can be a very dangerous warning sign that you're about to have a heat injury.  So, if you sense a headache, get inside, wipe yourself down, get cool in a nice air conditioned room and drink plenty, plenty of fluids.<br/> <br/>     SYLVESTER:  Small children, older folks.  We've often heard that they are particularly susceptible to the heat.  Who else needs to take extra precautions?<br/> <br/>     LLOYD:  It's a very, very big group.  You already mentioned the young and old, those under 4 and those over 65.  But the overweight are already stressing their vascular system.  They need to lay low when the weather gets hot.  People with entirety problems, because the ozone gets high and they could have breathing problems.  There is many prescription medications that can cause problems in people stuck outside in hot weather.  And anyone who's had a previous heat injury, heat stress, heat cramps, heatstroke, is automatically a setup for a repeat injury if they get out in that hot temperature.<br/> <br/>     SYLVESTER:  You mentioned medications.  Give us some examples.<br/> <br/>     LLOYD:  Well, the most common medication used in America is alcohol.  If you're drinking beer by the poolside, you'd better be careful because it can cause you to be dehydrated.  But plenty of other prescription medications.  Things like sleeping pills, people who have Parkinson's disease that are taking medication, people with intestinal problems, diarrhea, irritable bowel, all of those medications can be lethal if you're taking them and stuck outside in the heat.  So ask your doctor or pharmacist, hey, will this medication cause a problem if I'm outside on a nice hot day for a picnic?<br/> <br/>     SYLVESTER:  When the temperature rises, does your body care if it's dry heat versus humid heat?<br/> <br/>     LLOYD:  Well, when it's extra humid, we talk about something called the wet bulb.  The body senses it's actually hotter than it is. And when it does, it turns out lots of perspiration.  Well, that's good as long as you have plenty of fluid onboard.  Outside in the dry heat you probably do perspire as much or do not sense that you're perspiring as much because it evaporates.  In either situation, when it gets over 85 degrees, find yourself a nice bottle of water.<br/> <br/>     SYLVESTER:  So, what are some smart ways, if you absolutely have to be outdoors for a period of time, what precautions can someone take?<br/> <br/>     LLOYD:  Well, the first one is proper coverage.  That could be a hat, loose-fitting clothing, lots of sun block.  Employ the buddy system.  If you're going to be out working on the roof or playing golf, go with someone else.  You check on them and they check on you and each makes sure the other takes plenty of water.<br/> <br/>     Take frequent breaks whenever you're doing any kind of task outside and be sure to replenish the fluids.  That's two to four glasses every hour.  The more activity, the more water you need. Remember the headache, and if you don't feed the need to urinate, you're probably not drinking enough.  And then finally, employ plenty of common sense.  When you've had enough, get indoors, cool off and watch CNN.<br/> <br/>     SYLVESTER:  All right.  That's great advice.  And on that note, we're going to end.  Thank you, Dr. Bill Lloyd.  Always a pleasure to have you on.<br/> <br/>     LLOYD:  We'll talk again soon.<br/> <br/>     SYLVESTER:  Will do.<br/> <br/>     Nest, find out how a clue discovered in this California convenience store helped authorities uncover a potential terrorist plot.<br/> <br/>     And coming up, a man convicted of killing a five-year-old girl is confronted in court by the victim's mother.  Find out what she said.<br/> <br/>     (COMMERCIAL BREAK)<br/> <br/>     SYLVESTER:  Police were trying to run down a rash of robberies in Southern California when their investigation took a dramatic turn.  As CNN's Thelma Gutierrez explains, a dropped clue to possible terrorist activity here in the U.S.<br/> <br/>     (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)<br/> <br/>     THELMA GUTIERREZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  It started out as a typical crime story.  A string of armed robberies in Los Angeles County.  Two masked men hitting gas stations demanding money.<br/> <br/>     UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Put a gun to the guy.  Points a gun at him.<br/> <br/>     GUTIERREZ:  The robbers were successful again and again, until one of them literally dropped a clue.  A cell phone.  Sources familiar with the investigation say the phone belonged to one of these men, 21- year-old Gregory Patterson, or 25-year-old Lavar Washington, a parolee.  Police set up surveillance.<br/> <br/>     UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We're staking them out, and did witness an armed robbery.<br/> <br/>     GUTIERREZ:  Sources familiar with the case tell CNN when the home of Lavar Washington was being searched, investigators found what they found jihadist material.  That's when a routine robbery case became a terror investigation.<br/> <br/>     (on camera):  CNN has learned that investigators found bulletproof vests along with notes suggesting at least one planned attack was in the works.  Potential targets, National Guard recruiting centers, two synagogues and another building.  Investigators believe it might have been the Israeli consulate in Los Angeles.<br/> <br/>     (voice-over):  Sources tell CNN there is a, quote, "pointed and pressing investigation by the FBI's joint terrorism task force that could lead to federal charges against the men."  For now, Patterson and Washington are charged only with armed robbery.<br/> <br/>     WINSTON MCKESSON, PATTERSON'S ATTORNEY:  I really can't comment on that.<br/> <br/>     GUTIERREZ:  Gregory Patterson's lawyer says he was contacted by the U.S. attorney's office but says the government provided no details on its investigation.<br/> <br/>     MCKESSON:  I'm aware that we're in very precarious times.  The country is at war.  There is a terrorist attack on London and I think the government should take their extra precaution and doing that for our safety.  But I believe that once all the facts are in, it's going to point to the fact that my client in no way was part of a terrorist plot.<br/> <br/>     GUTTIEREZ:  Lavar Washington's attorney says it's just too early to make a statement on the terror investigation.  But Patterson's attorney says his client has no criminal record and was trying to help Washington reintegrate into society after he did time for assault with a deadly weapon.<br/> <br/>     JEROME HAIG, WASHINGTON'S ATTORNEY:  My information is that they were friends before they were arrested.  And I don't know how they met.  But they're both devout and religious people.<br/> <br/>     GUTTIEREZ:  Washington did his time in Folsom Prison where sources tell CNN Washington is believed to have converted to Islam.<br/> <br/>     MCKESSON:  This is a country where we honor the Bill of Rights, particularly the First Amendment that talks about the freedom of religion.  I would hope without jumping to conclusions because these men may be sympathetic to the Muslim faith to think that they're necessarily terrorists.<br/> <br/>     GUTTIEREZ:  Both Lavar Washington and Gregory Patterson are in custody awaiting a preliminary hearing on the 10 robbery charges.  But those charges may now take a back seat to a federal terror investigation.  Thelma Gutierrez, CNN, Los Angeles.<br/> <br/>     (END VIDEOTAPE)<br/> <br/>     SYLVESTER:  Now, some other stories making news across America. The search for a registered sex offender in Idaho expands to other states in the Pacific Northwest.  Authorities are searching for John R. Tuggle, the only suspect in the stabbing of his 12-year-old daughter.  The girl is in serious condition but is talking to investigators.     A police car's dashboard camera captures a dramatic high-speed chase.  It began when police tried to pull the car over in North Carolina.  The car reached speeds of 102 miles per hour before hitting an embankment and spinning around in mid air.  A woman and her five- year-old were in the back seat unhurt.  The 18-year-old driver was arrested.<br/> <br/>     And a Boston construction worker is being called a good Samaritan.  He saw a robbery taking place going on at a Dunkin Donuts next to his job site.  And after the suspect walked out Jason Merry (ph) chased the suspect down and demanded the money back.<br/> <br/>     Alejandro Avila was sentenced Friday for the kidnapping, assault and murder of five-year-old Samantha Runnion three years ago.  But as Donna Tetro explained, before he was sentenced to California's death row, Avila faced the anger and pain of Runnion's mother.<br/> <br/>     (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)<br/> <br/>     ERIN RUNNION, SAMANTHA RUNNION'S MOTHER:  I have written and rewritten what I would say to the man who killed Samantha.  And you better pay attention.  Because I never want to address you again.  You don't deserve a place in my family's history.  And so I want you to live.<br/> <br/>     But Alejandro Avila is on his way to death row.<br/> <br/>     JUDGE WILLIAM FROEBERG, ORANGE COUNTY SUPERIOR COURT:  You shall suffer the death penalty.  Said penalty shall be inflicted within the walls of the state prison at San Quentin, California.<br/> <br/>     Sentenced to death for the abduction, brutal rape and murder of 5-year-old Samantha Runnion in the summer of 2002.  Samantha was outside playing with her friend, Sarah Ahn, when Avila nabbed her.<br/> <br/>     SARAH AHN, SAMANTHA RUNNION'S FRIEND:  She said, help!  Tell my grandma!  Then I did.<br/> <br/>     Kicking and screaming she disappeared.  The next day Samantha's body was found in a remote area 50 miles from home.<br/> <br/>     UNIDENTIFIED MALE (audio clip):  Oh, my God!  We found a dead body!  Please hurry.  I'm so scared!  It was a little kid!<br/> <br/>     RUNNION:  And she fought.  And I know she fought you.  I know she looked at you with those amazing brown eyes and you still wanted to kill her.<br/> <br/>     Samantha's fight sealed Avila's fate.  His DNA under her fingernails and DNA likely from Samantha's teardrops inside his car.<br/> <br/>     UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Tragedy brings us together.More than 4,000 people attended Samantha's funeral.<br/> <br/>     RUNNION:  She wanted to be a dancer and a teacher and a mother. She loved so many things.  She had so much passion for life.  I'll never know what she would have become.<br/> <br/>     What Erin Runnion has become isn't anything she could have ever fathomed.  Now she dedicates her life from saving other children from sexual predators, from people like Alexandra Avila.<br/> <br/>     RUNNION:  You knew it was wrong, and you chose not to think about it.  Well, now you have a lot of time to think about it.  Don't waste it.  Write it down so that the rest of us can figure out how to stop you people.<br/> <br/>     Donna Tetro, for CNN, Los Angeles.<br/> <br/>     (END VIDEOTAPE)<br/> <br/>     SYLVESTER:  Coming up tonight at 10:00 Eastern, we'll have the full unedited testimony of Erin Runnion.  We'll also have some tips to help to keep your children safe.  Now joining us now, Carol Lin is here with a preview of what's to come.<br/> <br/>     Carol, what's on tap for your show, 6:00 p.m. Eastern?<br/> <br/>     CAROL LIN, CNN ANCHOR:  Coming up at 6:00 Eastern, there is an award-winning documentary producer who is going out and giving people the microphone over at Ground Zero in New York and saying, record your memories.  Where were you on 9/11.  And he's getting some really compelling stories.  So I'll be talking to him about that project. It's called Storycore.<br/> <br/>     And also, we're going to be talking about the controversy about juice.  It doesn't sound controversial, but if you're a parent, should you give your kid juice, is it addicting.  Does it lead to soda?  So we're going to be talking about that in our "Fountain of Youth" segment and of course, looking forward to the segment with Erin Runnion's -- mother in our prime time show at 10:00.  Her testimony was riveting.<br/> <br/>     SYLVESTER:  We just saw a sampling of it there.<br/> <br/>     LIN:  Just a sampling of it.  And then I'll be talking with Mark Klaas about how to keep your kids safe.  That's at 10 o'clock tonight.<br/> <br/>     SYLVESTER:  Sounds fascinating.  A whole lot on tap.  Appreciate it, Carol.  We'll be tuning in.  Thanks.<br/> <br/>     Their mission would make for a great television drama, but the consequences are very real.  Next go behind the scenes and see how the FBI is trying to connect the dots to prevent new terror attacks.<br/> <br/>     (COMMERCIAL BREAK)<br/> <br/>     SYLVESTER:  Finally this hour, connecting the dots, what the FBI is doing to improve its performance as it tries to prevent another 9/11.  CNN's Kelli Arena reports from Washington.<br/> <br/>     (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)<br/> <br/>     KELLI ARENA, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Dina Corsi is clear about how important her job is.<br/> <br/>     DINA CORSI, FBI SUPERVISORY ANALYST:  On 9/11, no one here lost a husband.  They didn't lose a daughter or a wife.  They lost 3,000. And we all take that responsibility very personally.  It's not something we're ever going to forget.<br/> <br/>     ARENA:  Corsi is a veteran analyst for the FBI.  She works alongside field agents from beginning to end on investigations.  But it wasn't always that way.<br/> <br/>     CORSI:  We've had analysts in the field for a long time, really since the existence of the analytical position in the FBI.  But what we're doing now is making a concerted concentrated effort to make the analytical cadre more a part of the cycle.<br/> <br/>     ARENA:  Building a strong analytical core is vital to preventing another terror attack.  Analysts are the people who connect the dots, pointing field agents in the right directions.  FBI analyst Barbara Tipton was recruited ten months ago.<br/> <br/>     BARBARA TIPTON, FBI INTELLIGENCE ANALYST:  We look for trends. We look for suspicious activities.  We look for pieces of a puzzle that when finally put together might indicate some issue that we need to pay more attention to.<br/> <br/>     ARENA:  Tipton and other analysts he now goes through training at the FBI Academy just like agents do.  This class focused on psychological profiles.<br/> <br/>     UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Purely analytical.<br/> <br/>     ARENA:  There are now more than 2,200 analysts.  That's more than double the number on September 11th.  There are more opportunities for promotions and higher pay.  And the FBI has increased information sharing with other agencies, putting out more than 11,000 intelligence reports since 9/11.  To speed communication, FBI analysts now work in the same room as their CIA counterparts in the new National Counterterrorism Center.<br/> <br/>     MAUREEN BAGINSKI, FBI INTELLIFENCE DIRECTOR:  Everyone understands and equally understands that they have a particular mission to fulfill.  And that to together is the only way this adversary is going to be defeated.<br/> <br/>     ARENA:  Maureen Baginski's job is to drive the FBI's intelligence upgrade.  And she says it's working.<br/> <br/>     BAGINSKI:  I can tell you every day, every one of our reports has a customer feedback page on it.  And I receive all of those personally.  And I could show you some stellar comments from customers who comment on how well written our reporting is.  But more importantly, how actionable it is.<br/> <br/>     ARENA:  Lee Hamilton the vice chairman of the September 11th commission says the FBI is headed in the right direction, but he still sees gaps.     LEE HAMILTON, 9/11 COMMISSION VICE CHAIRMAN:  Their biggest failure by far is in their information technology system, their computer system, which they have acknowledged publicly, has not worked after the investment of scores of millions of dollars.  That's a very dramatic failure.<br/> <br/>     ARENA:  Hamilton says what the FBI needs most is more time.  But one intelligence veteran says, even that may not do the trick.<br/> <br/>     JOHN GANNO, FORMER CIA OFFICIAL:  Even if I give you time, you're never going to get there until Maureen Baginski has budgetary authority, has the personnel authority, really, to control a directorate of intelligence and the people in it.<br/> <br/>     ARENA:  Changes in the works don't go that far, but there are plans to continue the reorganization.<br/> <br/>     ROBERT MUELLER, FBI DIRECTOR:  I see it as an acknowledgement, and a further answer of the development of the FBI to respond to the threats of today.<br/> <br/>     ARENA:  As Britain recovers from terrorist attacks planned by its own citizens, there is a more urgent need for first-rate domestic intelligence gathering here in the United States.  And that falls squarely on the FBI's shoulders.  Kelli Arena, CNN, Washington.<br/> <br/>     (END VIDEOTAPE)<br/> <br/>     SYLVESTER:  There's still much more ahead on CNN.  Straight ahead, PEOPLE IN THE NEWS profiles 50 Cent's rise from drug dealer to multi-platinum rapper.  Then, at 6:00 Eastern, in search of the fountain of youth.  Carol Lin breaks down fact from fiction when it comes to fruit juices.  At 7:00 Eastern, it's ON THE STORY.
