		Commissioner Warns Motorists about Dangerous Gang
	
	</p>
<h1 id="Skip">Commissioner Warns Motorists about Dangerous Gang</h1>
<p>Buffalo Police Commissioner H. McCarthy Gipson continues to warn motorists in the Buffalo and Western New York area about the possibility of a dangerous street gang making its way into the area. Early Wednesday evening, the commissioner alerted the public, after the department received high level credible information that gang members could be targeting motorists. Gipson is alerting all motorists not to get out of their vehicles if they are hit or bumped from behind by another vehicle. One of the tactics of the gang in question is to target motorists, hit them from behind, and then when the driver gets out of the vehicle, gang members either rob or assault the victims. The commissioner has urged motorists to do the following if this happens to you:</p><ul><li>Keep driving, do not get out of your vehicle. </li><li>As soon as possible, call 9-1-1 and alert them of the situation. </li><li>If at all possible, get a description of the vehicle or a license plate number. </li><li>Drive to the nearest police station. The district locations in Buffalo are on our homepage. </li><li>Remain alert and vigilant. </li></ul><p>The Buffalo Police Department continues to investigate the matter. In making the decision to release the information to the public, Commissioner Gipson stressed that the concerns over public safety outweighed any other concerns. Anyone with information regarding this matter is asked to call the Confidential Tip Call Line at (716) 847-2255.</p>
