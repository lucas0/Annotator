data-template="two-column" id="articleBody"><div><div><div class="SectionBreak SectionBreak__sectionBreak___1ppA7"></div><div class="SectionBreak SectionBreak__sectionBreak___1ppA7"><p>In <span data-page="page_1"></span>March, Annabella Sciorra, who received an Emmy nomination for her
role in “The Sopranos,” agreed to talk with me for a story I was
reporting about <a class="ArticleBody__link___1FS03" href="https://www.newyorker.com/tag/harvey-weinstein">Harvey Weinstein</a>. Speaking by phone, I explained that
two sources had told me that she had a serious allegation regarding the
producer. Sciorra, however, told me that Weinstein had never done
anything inappropriate. Perhaps she just wasn’t his type, she said, with
an air of what seemed to be studied nonchalance. But, two weeks ago,
after <em class="">The New Yorker</em> published <a class="ArticleBody__link___1FS03" href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/from-aggressive-overtures-to-sexual-assault-harvey-weinsteins-accusers-tell-their-stories">the story</a>, in which thirteen women
accused Weinstein of sexual assault and harassment, Sciorra called me.
The truth, she said, was that she had been struggling to speak about
Weinstein for more than twenty years. She was still living in fear of
him, and slept with a baseball bat by her bed. Weinstein, she told me,
had violently raped her in the early nineteen-nineties, and, over the
next several years, sexually harassed her repeatedly.</p><p>“I was so scared. I was looking out the window of my living room, and I
faced the water of the East River,” she said, recalling our initial
conversation. “I really wanted to tell you. I was like, ‘This is the
moment you’ve been waiting for your whole life. . . .’ ” she said. “I
really, really panicked,” she added. “I was shaking. And I just wanted
to get off the phone.”</p><p>All told, more than fifty women have now levelled accusations against
Weinstein, in accounts published by the New York <em class="">Times</em>, <em class="">The New
Yorker</em>, and other outlets. But many other victims have continued to be
reluctant to talk to me about their experiences, declining interview
requests or initially agreeing to talk and then wavering. As more women
have come forward, the costs of doing so have certainly shifted. But
many still say that they face overwhelming pressures to stay silent,
ranging from the spectre of career damage to fears about the
life-altering consequences of being marked as sexual-assault victims.
“Now when I go to a restaurant or to an event, people are going to know
that this happened to me,” Sciorra said. “They’re gonna look at me and
they’re gonna know. I’m an intensely private person, and this is the
most unprivate thing you can do.”</p><p>The actress Daryl Hannah told me this week about two incidents that
occurred, during the early aughts, in which Weinstein pounded on her
hotel-room door until she, in one case, escaped out a back entrance.
When it happened again the following day, she barricaded herself in her
room using furniture. Another time, Weinstein asked her if he could
touch her breasts. She believes that, after she refused, Weinstein
retaliated against her professionally. “I am a private person, with a
rule of speaking to the press only for professional reasons,” she told
me. Hannah said that she had decided to speak publicly about her
experiences for the first time, more than a decade after they occurred,
because “I feel a moral obligation to support the women who have
suffered much more egregious transgressions.” She, like many women who
have come forward, still had doubts about the trade-offs she would have
to make for speaking openly. “It’s one of those things your body has to
adjust to. You get dragged into the gutter of nastiness and pettiness
and shame and all of these things, and it sometimes seems healthier and
wiser to just move on with your life and not allow yourself to be
re-victimized.”</p><div class="CneEmbed__cneEmbed___s8Ijz"><div class="CneEmbed__video___2827A"><div class="CneEmbed__videoPlaceHolder___ayuTT"><div class="embed cneembed-embed-component" data-type="cneembed" data-url="script/video/5a0f39d12d1ca05150000005.js?muted=1"><div><div class="cne-player-container" id="9d7b2b5a-ed48-f964-f1dc-208dd0cb367" style="box-sizing:content-box;display:inline-block;height:0px;padding-top:56.25%;position:relative;transition:height 300ms ease-in-out;vertical-align:top;width:100%;"><iframe allowfullscreen="true" allowtransparency="true" frameborder="0" msallowfullscreen="true" scrolling="no" style="height:1px !important;left:0px;min-height:100%;min-width:100%;position:absolute;top:0px;width:1px !important;" title="Video Player"></iframe></div><script async="" class="processed" src="https://player.cnevids.com/script/video/5a0f39d12d1ca05150000005.js?muted=1"></script></div></div></div></div></div><p>A woman who appeared anonymously in my previous article, alleging that
Weinstein raped her while she worked for him, and who has chosen to
remain nameless, told me that she has yet to tell even people close to
her about the full extent of her allegation. “I want to be braver. I
really do,” she told me. “I want to be able to put my name to this and
talk through what happened, but I am surrounded by people who, the first
thing they’ll do is read this article, and I’ll be working three desks
from them, and they’ll know details of my life I haven’t even told my
family.” For many women, this was the most difficult decision of their
lives. Sciorra, too, still has doubts. “Even now, as I tell you, and
have had all these women around saying it’s O.K.,” Sciorra told me, “I’m
petrified again.”</p><p>Sallie Hofmeister, a spokesperson for Weinstein, issued a statement in
response to the allegations by Sciorra and Hannah. “Mr. Weinstein
unequivocally denies any allegations of non-consensual sex,” she said.</p></div><div class="SectionBreak SectionBreak__sectionBreak___1ppA7"><p>Sciorra first met Weinstein in the early nineties, when she was an
emerging star after appearing in films such as “The Hand That Rocks the
Cradle.” Her agent introduced them at an industry party in Los Angeles.
Weinstein was friendly, she said, and gave her a ride home; they talked
about their shared love of film. Several months later, when her friend
Warren Leight was trying to get a romantic-comedy screenplay he’d
written made, Sciorra called Weinstein about it. Weinstein said that he
wanted to make the film, which was called “The Night We Never Met,” and
to start filming with Sciorra in a leading role. He wanted her to start
work immediately after she finished two back-to-back shoots she already
had planned for that summer. “I said, ‘Harvey, I cannot do this right now. I<span data-page="page_2"></span> need some time,’ ” she recalled. “That’s the first time he
threatened to sue me.” (Sources close to Weinstein deny that he
threatened to sue Sciorra.)</p><p>After Sciorra finished making “The Night We Never Met,” she said that
she became ensconced in “this circle of Miramax,” referring to
Weinstein’s studio, which was then gaining an increasingly dominant role
in the industry. There were so many screenings and events and dinners,
Sciorra said, that it was hard to imagine life outside of the Weinstein
ecosystem. At one dinner, in New York, she recalled, “Harvey was there,
and I got up to leave. And Harvey said, ‘Oh, I'll drop you off.’ Harvey
had dropped me off before, so I didn’t really expect anything out of the
ordinary—I expected just to be dropped off.” In the car, Weinstein said
goodbye to Sciorra, and she went upstairs to her apartment. She was
alone and getting ready for bed a few minutes later when she heard a
knock on the door. “It wasn’t that late,” she said. “Like, it wasn’t the
middle of the night, so I opened the door a crack to see who it was. And
he pushed the door open.” She paused to collect herself. Weinstein, she
continued, “walked in like it was his apartment, like he owned the
place, and started unbuttoning his shirt. So it was very clear where he
thought this was going to go. And I was in a nightgown. I didn’t have
much on.” He circled the apartment; to Sciorra, it appeared that he was
checking whether anyone else was there.</p><div class="Callout__inset-right___3Etg2" data-callout="inset-right" data-type="callout"><div class="CuratedEmbed__container___1VdYz"><a class="Link__link___3dWao" href="https://www.newyorker.com/tag/harvey-weinstein/?intcid=embedded_curation" target="_blank"><h3 class="CuratedEmbed__hed___WpzZ8">Read more</h3><p class="CuratedEmbed__dek___4PRlj">Our coverage of Harvey Weinstein.</p></a></div></div><p>Sciorra told me that listening to a recording from 2015 that <em class="">The New
Yorker</em> released earlier this month, in which Weinstein is heard
demanding that a model enter his hotel room, “really triggered me.”
Sciorra remembered Weinstein employing the same tactics as he cornered
her, backing her into her bedroom. “Come here, come on, cut it out, what
are you doing, come here,” she remembered him saying. She tried to be
assertive. “This is not happening,” she told him. “You’ve got to go. You
have to leave. Get out of my apartment.”</p><p>Then Weinstein grabbed her, she said. “He shoved me onto the bed, and he
got on top of me.” Sciorra struggled. “I kicked and I yelled,” she said,
but Weinstein locked her arms over her head with one hand and forced
sexual intercourse on her. “When he was done, he ejaculated on my leg,
and on my nightgown.” It was a family heirloom, handed down from
relatives in Italy and embroidered in white cotton. “He said, ‘I have
impeccable timing,’ and then he said, ‘This is for you.’ ” Sciorra
paused. “And then he attempted to perform oral sex on me. And I
struggled, but I had very little strength left in me.” Sciorra said that
her body started to shake violently. “I think, in a way, that’s what
made him leave, because it looked like I was having a seizure or
something.”</p><p>In the weeks and months that followed the alleged attack, Sciorra didn’t
tell anyone about it. “Like most of these women, I was so ashamed of
what happened,” she said. “And I fought. I <em class="">fought</em>. But still I was
like, Why did I open that door? Who opens the door at that time of
night? I was definitely embarrassed by it. I felt disgusting. I felt
like I had fucked up.” She grew depressed and lost weight. Her father,
unaware of the attack but concerned for her well-being, urged her to seek
help, and she did see a therapist, but, she said, “I don’t even think I
told the therapist. It’s pathetic.”</p><p>Sciorra never spoke to the police. Neither did the anonymous woman who
alleged rape in the earlier <em class="">New Yorker</em> article, although two others
did. The anonymous woman said that, although “I regret not being maybe
stronger in the moment,” her fears that charging Weinstein publicly
might change her life permanently were too great. “It’s hard to know. . . .
It’s like choosing a different life path.”</p><p>Some of the obstacles that Sciorra and other women believed they faced
were related to Weinstein’s power in the film industry. Sciorra said
that she felt the impact on her livelihood almost immediately. “From
1992, I didn’t work again until 1995,” she said. “I just kept getting
this pushback of ‘We heard you were difficult; we heard this or that.’ I
think that that was the Harvey machine.” The actress Rosie Perez, a
friend who was among the first to discuss Sciorra’s allegations with
her, told me, “She was riding high, and then she started acting weird
and getting reclusive. It made no sense. Why did this woman, who was so
talented, and riding so high, doing hit after hit, then all of a sudden
fall off the map? It hurts me as a fellow-actress to see her career not
flourish the way it should have.”</p><p>Several years later, Sciorra did begin working again. Weinstein again
pursued her with unwanted sexual advances, she said. In 1995, she was in
London shooting “The Innocent Sleep,” which Weinstein did not produce.
According to Sciorra, Weinstein began leaving her messages, demanding
that she call him or that they meet at his hotel. “I don’t know how he
found me,” she said. “I’d come home from work and there’d be a message<span data-page="page_3"></span> that Harvey Weinstein had called. This went on and on.” He sent cars to
her hotel to bring her to him, which she ignored. One night, he showed
up at her room and began pounding on the door, she said. “For nights
after, I couldn't sleep. I piled furniture in front of the door, like in
the movies.” Finally, she pleaded with Matthew Vaughn, then a
twenty-two-year-old producer on the film, and more recently a prominent
director, to move her secretly to a different hotel. (Vaughn said that he recalled booking her a room elsewhere.)</p><div class="recircCarouselUnit RecirculationCarousel__carousel___3oV_x" id="RecircCarousel"><p

Sciorra appeared in the crime drama “Cop Land” as Liz
Randone, the wife of a corrupt police officer. She said that she
auditioned for the part without realizing at first that it was a Miramax
film, and she learned that Weinstein’s company was involved only when
she began contract negotiations. (A person close to Weinstein contested
this, saying that the script had the studio’s name on it.) In May, 1997,
shortly before the film’s release, she went to the Cannes Film Festival.
When she checked into the Hôtel du Cap-Eden-Roc, in Antibes, France, a
Miramax associate told her that Weinstein’s room would be next to hers.
“My heart just sank,” Sciorra recalled. Early one morning, while she was
still asleep, there was a knock on the door. Groggy, and thinking she
must have forgotten about an early hair-and-makeup call, she opened the
door. “There’s Harvey in his underwear, holding a bottle of baby oil in
one hand and a tape, a movie, in the other,” she recalled. “And it was
horrific, because I’d been there before.” Sciorra said that she ran from
Weinstein. “He was closing in really quickly, and I pressed all the call
buttons for valet service and room service. I kept pressing all of them
until someone showed up.” Weinstein retreated, she said, when hotel
staff arrived.</p><p>Over time, Sciorra opened up to a small number of people. Perez said
that she heard from an acquaintance about Weinstein’s behavior at the
hotel in London and questioned Sciorra about what happened. Sciorra told
Perez about the attack in her apartment, and Perez, who was sexually
assaulted by a relative during her childhood, began crying. “I said,
‘Oh, Annabella, you’ve gotta go to the police.’ She said, ‘I can’t go to
the police. He’s destroying my career.’ ”</p></div><div class="SectionBreak SectionBreak__sectionBreak___1ppA7"><p>Unlike Sciorra, Daryl Hannah, who is known for her roles in “Splash,”
“Wall Street,” and many other films, told colleagues about what had
happened to her. “I did tell people about it,” she told me. “And it
didn’t matter.” Hannah first met Weinstein at the Cannes Film Festival,
in the early aughts, before she appeared in “Kill Bill: Volume 1,” which
Weinstein produced. She was returning to her room at the Hôtel du
Cap-Eden-Roc, the same hotel where Sciorra said Weinstein harassed her.
She saw Weinstein, who was at a reception in the hotel bar nearby. He
called her over, and told her that he loved her work. Then he asked for
her room number so that he could call her to schedule a meeting.</p><p>“That seemed pretty normal to me, you know, how people talk in business,
and I didn’t know his reputation or anything,” Hannah said. She was in
her room, already in her pajamas and getting ready for bed, when the
phone calls started. “It felt like it was too late to have a meeting. I
didn’t want to answer.” Though she didn’t pick up, she guessed that it
was Weinstein. “And then, shortly thereafter, the knocking on the door
began,” she told me. “It was sort of incessant, and then it started
turning into pounding on my door,” she said. She was certain that it was
Weinstein—as she recalls, she saw him through the peephole in the door.
The pounding became so frightening that Hannah, who was staying on the
ground floor, left her room via an exterior door. She spent the night in
her makeup artist’s room. The following evening, Hannah was in her room
with the makeup artist, packing her things ahead of their departure the
next morning, when the pounding on the door began again. “The knocking
started again and again. And I was like, ‘Oh, shit,’ ” Hannah recalled.
“We actually pushed a dresser in front of the door and just kind of
huddled in the room.” The next morning, as they left, Weinstein was
standing outside the hotel, and appeared, she felt, to be waiting for
her. She left quickly and went to the airport.</p><p>Several years later, while she was promoting “Kill Bill: Volume 2,”
Hannah was in Rome for the film’s Italian première. She and the rest of
the cast were scheduled to depart the following morning on a private
plane belonging to Miramax. The première was followed by a reception,
after which Hannah was in her suite at the  Hotel de Russie with
another hair-and-makeup artist, Steeve Daviault. The two had changed into
their pajamas and were sitting on Hannah’s bed with an order of
room-service spaghetti, watching a Sophia Loren movie, when Weinstein
entered the bedroom. “He had a key,” Hannah recalled. “He came through
the living room and into the bedroom. He just burst in like a raging
bull. And I know with every fibre of my being that if my male makeup
artist was not in that<span data-page="page_4"></span> room, things would not have gone well. It was
scary.” Daviault remembered the incident vividly. “I was there to keep
her safe,” he told me.</p><p>When Hannah asked Weinstein what he was doing, he became flustered and
angry, she said. Weinstein demanded that she get dressed and attend a
party downstairs. Hannah pointed out that no one had ever mentioned a
party. Weinstein stormed out, and she quickly took off her glasses and
pajamas, donned a dress, and headed downstairs. When she arrived at the
reception room Weinstein had mentioned, it was “completely empty,”
Hannah recalled. “And it wasn’t even like there had been a party there.
I didn’t see drinks around.” As she turned to leave, Weinstein was
standing by the elevator. Hannah asked him what was happening and
Weinstein replied, “Are your tits real?” Then he asked if he could feel
them. “I said, ‘No, you can’t!’ And then he said, ‘At least flash me,
then.’ And I said, ‘Fuck off, Harvey.’ ” She took the elevator back to
her room and went to sleep.</p><p>“I experienced instant repercussions,” she told me. The next morning,
the Miramax private plane left without Hannah on it. Her flights for a
trip to Cannes for the film’s French première were cancelled, as were
her hotel room in Cannes and her hair-and-makeup artist for the
festival. “I called everybody,” she recalled, including her manager, a
producer on the film, and its director, Quentin Tarantino, who has since
<a class="ArticleBody__link___1FS03" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/19/movies/tarantino-weinstein.html?_r=0" target="_blank">told the <em class="">Times</em></a> that he knew enough, from his years collaborating with
Weinstein, to have done more to stop him, and regrets his failure to do
so. “I called all the powers that be and told them what had happened,”
Hannah said. “And that I thought that was the repercussion, you know,
the backlash from my experience.”</p><p>“And it didn’t matter,” Hannah said. “I think that it doesn’t matter if
you’re a well-known actress, it doesn’t matter if you’re twenty or if
you’re forty, it doesn’t matter if you report or if you don’t, because
we are not believed. We are more than not believed—we are berated and
criticized and blamed.”</p><p>Other women told me that Hannah’s fear of retaliation was well-founded. The
actress Ellen Barkin told me that, though she was never a victim of
Weinstein’s sexual advances, he frequently verbally abused her, calling
her a “cunt” and “cunt bitch” during the filming of “Into the West,”
which he produced. “The repercussions are real,” she said. “I was
terrified Harvey was going to make it impossible to go back to work,
with those tentacles of his.” She continued, “This fear of losing your
career is not losing your ticket to a borrowed dress and earrings
someone paid you to wear. It’s losing your ability to support yourself,
to support your family, and this is fucking real whether you are the
biggest movie star or the lowest-pay-grade assistant.”</p></div><div class="SectionBreak SectionBreak__sectionBreak___1ppA7"><p>Many of the women with allegations about Weinstein told me that the
forces that kept them quiet continue to this day. Beginning in the early
months of this year, Weinstein and his associates began calling women to
determine who had spoken to the press. Three women who received those
calls said that they were
pressed for details about their communications with reporters. The calls
nearly silenced them. In addition, Sciorra and several other individuals
connected to the story received calls from a man they believed was
working for Weinstein and posing as a journalist, who offered few
details about himself and did not name any publication he was working
for. “He said he was doing a piece about how movies have changed in the
last thirty years, and I was like, ‘You fucker.’ ”</p><p>Sciorra and others said that Weinstein has a reputation for using the
press to smear and intimidate people he sees as threats. “I’ve
known now for a long time how powerful Harvey became, and how he owned a
lot of journalists and gossip columnists,” Sciorra told me. Three
sources with knowledge of the activities of Miramax Books corroborated
some of Sciorra’s suspicions, saying that Weinstein would offer book
deals to gossip columnists. The implication, the sources felt, was that
he was trying to influence them. Weinstein’s reputation for manipulating
the media created an atmosphere of paranoia. During one of our
conversations, Sciorra said to me, “As I was talking to you, I got
scared that it wasn’t really you.”</p><p>The power of the tabloid press to help silence women has been
underscored in recent weeks. While there has been an enormous outpouring
of support for those who have spoken out against Weinstein, there has
also been a backlash. Asia Argento, an Italian actress who alleged, in
the earlier <em class="">New Yorker</em> story, that Weinstein forcibly performed oral
sex on her, and also described, in all its nuance, their ensuing
relationship, which included consensual sex, told me that, when she
decided to speak, she was knowingly sacrificing her reputation. “This
will completely destroy me,” she predicted.</p><p>Since her story was made public, she has fled her native Italy,
following public shaming there. The journalist Renato Farina wrote an
article about her in the conservative daily <em class="">Libero</em>, titled “First they
give it away, then they whine and pretend to repent.” In a radio
interview, the paper’s editor, Vittorio Feltri, said that Argento should
be thankful that Weinstein had forced oral sex on her. Some women<span data-page="page_final"></span> joined
the chorus, including the commentator Selvaggia Lucarelli. She suggested
that it was not “legitimate” to raise an allegation twenty years after
the fact.</p><p>“I knew, when I spoke up, that things would be difficult. That there
would be some who would doubt me, mock me, even malign me. I knew this,”
Argento told me this week. “But I was unprepared for the naked contempt,
the unapologetically hateful public shaming and vilification I received
in my own country. Much of it from women. Women! . . . It hurt me. Badly.”</p><p>Sciorra said that the attacks on Argento and other accusers reinforced
her fears about speaking out, but they also finally made her believe
that she had no choice but to do so. “The way they’re treating Asia, and
the way they’re treating a lot of women, is so infuriating,” she said.
The attempts to downplay the significance of Argento’s allegations made
her realize the importance of her own story. “O.K., you want rape?” she
said, addressing those commentators who questioned whether Argento’s
experience qualified. “Here’s fucking rape.”</p><p>Virtually all the women I talked to who were struggling with whether to
speak publicly said that advice from friends, loved ones, and colleagues
was a deciding factor. Sciorra was one of several who told me that those
they had consulted urged them to stay quiet. “I spoke with two people in
the business who I’ve known for a while, and they were very clearly
against me saying anything,” she told me. “And they were people I always
really trusted and I respect. And they felt that no good could come out
of it. Immediately, the response was ‘Stay as far away from this as
possible.’ ”</p><p>Rosie Perez said that she urged Sciorra to speak by describing her own
experience of going public about her assault. “I told her, ‘I used to
tread water for years. It’s fucking exhausting, and maybe speaking out,
that’s your lifeboat. Grab on and get out,’ ” Perez recalled. “I said,

Annabella Sciorra, who received an Emmy nomination for her\nrole in “The Sopranos,” agreed to talk with me for a story I was\nreporting about ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/tag/harvey-weinstein"},"Harvey Weinstein"],". Speaking by phone, I explained that\ntwo sources had told me that she had a serious allegation regarding the\nproducer. Sciorra, however, told me that Weinstein had never done\nanything inappropriate. Perhaps she just wasn’t his type, she said, with\nan air of what seemed to be studied nonchalance. But, two weeks ago,\nafter ",["em","The New Yorker"]," published ",["a",{"href":"https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/from-aggressive-overtures-to-sexual-assault-harvey-weinsteins-accusers-tell-their-stories"},"the story"],", in which thirteen women\naccused Weinstein of sexual assault and harassment, Sciorra called me.\nThe truth, she said, was that she had been struggling to speak about\nWeinstein for more than twenty years. She was still living in fear of\nhim, and slept with a baseball bat by her bed. Weinstein, she told me,\nhad violently raped her in the early nineteen-nineties, and, over the\nnext several years, sexually harassed her repeatedly."],["p","“I was so scared. I was looking out the window of my living room, and I\nfaced the water of the East River,” she said, recalling our initial\nconversation. “I really wanted to tell you. I was like, ‘This is the\nmoment you’ve been waiting for your whole life. . . .’ ” she said. “I\nreally, really panicked,” she added. “I was shaking. And I just wanted\nto get off the phone.”"],["p","All told, more than fifty women have now levelled accusations against\nWeinstein, in accounts published by the New York ",["em","Times"],", ",["em","The New\nYorker"],", and other outlets. But many other victims have continued to be\nreluctant to talk to me about their experiences, declining interview\nrequests or initially agreeing to talk and then wavering. As more women\nhave come forward, the costs of doing so have certainly shifted. But\nmany still say that they face overwhelming pressures to stay silent,\nranging from the spectre of career damage to fears about the\nlife-altering consequences of being marked as sexual-assault victims.\n“Now when I go to a restaurant or to an event, people are going to know\nthat this happened to me,” Sciorra said. “They’re gonna look at me and\nthey’re gonna know. I’m an intensely private person, and this is the\nmost unprivate thing you can do.”"],["p","The actress Daryl Hannah told me this week about two incidents that\noccurred, during the early aughts, in which Weinstein pounded on her\nhotel-room door until she, in one case, escaped out a back entrance.\nWhen it happened again the following day, she barricaded herself in her\nroom using furniture. Another time, Weinstein asked her if he could\ntouch her breasts. She believes that, after she refused, Weinstein\nretaliated against her professionally. “I am a private person, with a\nrule of speaking to the press only for professional reasons,” she told\nme. Hannah said that she had decided to speak publicly about her\nexperiences for the first time, more than a decade after they occurred,\nbecause “I feel a moral obligation to support the women who have\nsuffered much more egregious transgressions.” She, like many women who\nhave come forward, still had doubts about the trade-offs she would have\nto make for speaking openly. “It’s one of those things your body has to\nadjust to. You get dragged into the gutter of nastiness and pettiness\nand shame and all of these things, and it sometimes seems healthier and\nwiser to just move on with your life and not allow yourself to be\nre-victimized.”"],["inline-embed",{"type":"cneembed","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22cneembed%22%2C%22url%22%3A%22script%2Fvideo%2F5a0f39d12d1ca05150000005.js%3Fmuted%3D1%22%2C%22width%22%3A%22%22%2C%22height%22%3A%22%22%2C%22caption%22%3A%22%22%7D","ref":""}],["p","A woman who appeared anonymously in my previous article, alleging that\nWeinstein raped her while she worked for him, and who has chosen to\nremain nameless, told me that she has yet to tell even people close to\nher about the full extent of her allegation. “I want to be braver. I\nreally do,” she told me. “I want to be able to put my name to this and\ntalk through what happened, but I am surrounded by people who, the first\nthing they’ll do is read this article, and I’ll be working three desks\nfrom them, and they’ll know details of my life I haven’t even told my\nfamily.” For many women, this was the most difficult decision of their\nlives. Sciorra, too, still has doubts. “Even now, as I tell you, and\nhave had all these women around saying it’s O.K.,” Sciorra told me, “I’m\npetrified again.”"],["p","Sallie Hofmeister, a spokesperson for

Angeles.\nWeinstein was friendly, she said, and gave her a ride home; they talked\nabout their shared love of film. Several months later, when her friend\nWarren Leight was trying to get a romantic-comedy screenplay he’d\nwritten made, Sciorra called Weinstein about it. Weinstein said that he\nwanted to make the film, which was called “The Night We Never Met,” and\nto start filming with Sciorra in a leading role.

There were so many screenings and events and dinners,\nSciorra said, that it was hard to imagine life outside of the Weinstein\necosystem. At one dinner, in New York, she recalled, “Harvey was there,\nand I got up to leave. And Harvey said, ‘Oh, I'll drop you off.’ Harvey\nhad dropped me off before, so I didn’t really expect anything out of the\nordinary—I expected just to be dropped off.” In the car, Weinstein said\ngoodbye to Sciorra, and she went upstairs to her apartment. She was\nalone and getting ready for bed a few minutes later when she heard a\nknock on the door. “It wasn’t that late,” she said. “Like, it wasn’t the\nmiddle of the night, so I opened the door a crack to see who it was. And\nhe pushed the door open.” She paused to collect herself. Weinstein, she\ncontinued, “walked in like it was his apartment, like he owned the\nplace, and started unbuttoning his shirt. So it was very clear where he\nthought this was going to go. And I was in a nightgown. I didn’t have\nmuch on.” He circled the apartment; to Sciorra, it appeared that he was\nchecking whether anyone else was there."],["inline-embed",{"type":"callout","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22callout%22%2C%22name%22%3A%22inset-right%22%2C%22body%22%3A%22%3Cinline-embed%20type%3D%5C%22externallink%5C%22%20meta%3D%5C%22%257B%2522type%2522%253A%2522externallink%2522%252C%2522url%2522%253A%2522%252Fexternallinks%252F59ea5ceb33b5d65a6f0547d8%2522%252C%2522width%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522height%2522%253A%2522%2522%252C%2522caption%2522%253A%2522%2522%257D%5C%22%20ref%3D%5C%2259ea5ceb33b5d65a6f0547d8%5C%22%3E%3C%2Finline-embed%3E%22%2C%22attrs%22%3A%7B%7D%7D","ref":""},["inline-embed",{"type":"externallink","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22externallink%22%2C%22url%22%3A%22%2Fexternallinks%2F59ea5ceb33b5d65a6f0547d8%22%2C%22width%22%3A%22%22%2C%22height%22%3A%22%22%2C%22caption%22%3A%22%22%7D","ref":"59ea5ceb33b5d65a6f0547d8"}]],["p","Sciorra told me that listening to a recording from 2015 that ",["em","The New\nYorker"]," released earlier this month, in which Weinstein is heard\ndemanding that a model enter his hotel room, “really triggered me.”\nSciorra remembered Weinstein employing the same tactics as he cornered\nher, backing her into her bedroom. “Come here, come on, cut it out, what\nare you doing, come here,” she remembered him saying. She tried to be\nassertive. “This is not happening,” she told him. “You’ve got to go. You\nhave to leave. Get out of my apartment.”"],["p","Then Weinstein grabbed her, she said. “He shoved me onto the bed, and he\ngot on top of me.” Sciorra struggled. “I kicked and I yelled,” she said,\nbut Weinstein locked her arms over her head with one hand and forced\nsexual intercourse on her. “When he was done, he ejaculated on my leg,\nand on my nightgown.” It was a family heirloom, handed down from\nrelatives in Italy and embroidered in white cotton. “He said, ‘I have\nimpeccable timing,’ and then he said, ‘This is for you.’ ” Sciorra\npaused. “And then he attempted to perform oral sex on me. And I\nstruggled, but I had very little strength left in me.” Sciorra said that\nher body started to shake violently. “I think, in a way, that’s what\nmade him leave, because it looked like I was having a seizure or\nsomething.”"],["p","In the weeks and months that followed the alleged attack, Sciorra didn’t\ntell anyone about it. “Like most of these women, I was so ashamed of\nwhat happened,” she said. “And I fought.

I felt\nlike I had fucked up.” She grew depressed and lost weight. Her father,\nunaware of the attack but concerned for her well-being, urged her to seek\nhelp, and she did see a therapist, but, she said, “I don’t even think I\ntold the therapist. It’s pathetic.”"],["p","Sciorra never spoke to the police. Neither did the anonymous woman who\nalleged rape in the earlier ",["em","New Yorker"]," article, although two others\ndid. The anonymous woman said that, although “I regret not being maybe\nstronger in the moment,” her fears that charging Weinstein publicly\nmight change her life permanently were too great. “It’s hard to know. . . .\nIt’s like choosing a different life path.”"],["p","Some of the obstacles that Sciorra and other women believed they faced\nwere related to Weinstein’s power in the film industry. Sciorra said\nthat she felt the impact on her livelihood almost immediately. “From\n1992, I didn’t work again until 1995,” she said. “I just kept getting\nthis pushback of ‘We heard you were difficult; we heard this or that.’ I\nthink that that was the Harvey machine.” The actress Rosie Perez, a\nfriend who was among the first to discuss Sciorra’s allegations with\nher, told me, “She was riding high, and then she started acting weird\nand getting reclusive. It made no sense. Why did this woman, who was so\ntalented, and riding so high, doing hit after hit, then all of a sudden\nfall off the map? It hurts me as a fellow-actress to see her career not\nflourish the way it should have.”"],["p","Several years later, Sciorra did begin working again. Weinstein again\npursued her with unwanted sexual advances, she said. In 1995, she was in\nLondon shooting “The Innocent Sleep,” which Weinstein did not produce.\nAccording to Sciorra, Weinstein began leaving her messages, demanding\nthat she call him or that they meet at his hotel. “I don’t know how he\nfound me,” she said. “I’d come home from work and there’d be a message",["inline-embed",{"type":"analytics","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22analytics%22%2C%22url%22%3A%223%22%2C%22width%22%3A%22%22%2C%22height%22%3A%22%22%2C%22caption%22%3A%22%22%7D","ref":""}]," that Harvey Weinstein had called. This went on and on.” He sent cars to\nher hotel to bring her to him, which she ignored. One night, he showed\nup at her room and began pounding on the door, she said. “For nights\nafter, I couldn't sleep. I piled furniture in front of the door, like in\nthe movies.” Finally, she pleaded with Matthew Vaughn, then a\ntwenty-two-year-old producer on the film, and more recently a prominent\ndirector, to move her secretly to a different hotel. (Vaughn said that he recalled booking her a room elsewhere.)"],["p","Two years later, Sciorra appeared in the crime drama “Cop Land” as Liz\nRandone, the wife of a corrupt police officer. She said that she\nauditioned for the part without realizing at first that it was a Miramax\nfilm, and she learned that Weinstein’s company was involved only when\nshe began contract negotiations. (A person close to Weinstein contested\nthis, saying that the script had the studio’s name on it.) In May, 1997,\nshortly before the film’s release, she went to the Cannes Film Festival.\nWhen she checked into the Hôtel du Cap-Eden-Roc, in Antibes, France, a\nMiramax associate told her that Weinstein’s room would be next to hers.\n“My heart just sank,” Sciorra recalled. Early one morning, while she was\nstill asleep, there was a knock on the door. Groggy, and thinking she\nmust have forgotten about an early hair-and-makeup call, she opened the\ndoor. “There’s Harvey in his underwear, holding a bottle of baby oil in\none hand and a tape, a movie, in the other,” she recalled. “And it was\nhorrific, because I’d been there before.” Sciorra said that she ran from\nWeinstein. “He was closing in really quickly, and I pressed all the call\nbuttons for valet service and room service. I kept pressing all of them\nuntil someone showed up.” Weinstein retreated, she said, when hotel\nstaff arrived."],["p","Over time, Sciorra opened up to a small number of people. Perez said\nthat she heard from an acquaintance about Weinstein’s behavior at the\nhotel in London and questioned Sciorra about what happened. Sciorra told\nPerez about the attack in her apartment, and Perez, who was sexually\nassaulted by a relative during her childhood, began crying. “I said,\n‘Oh, Annabella, you’ve gotta go to the police.’ She said, ‘I can’t go to\nthe police. He’s destroying my career.’

Sciorra, Daryl Hannah, who is known for her roles in “Splash,”\n“Wall Street,” and many other films, told colleagues about what had\nhappened to her. “I did tell people about it,” she told me. “And it\ndidn’t matter.” Hannah first met Weinstein at the Cannes Film Festival,\nin the early aughts, before she appeared in “Kill Bill: Volume 1,” which\nWeinstein produced. She was returning to her room at the Hôtel du\nCap-Eden-Roc, the same hotel where Sciorra said Weinstein harassed her.\nShe saw Weinstein, who was at a reception in the hotel bar nearby. He\ncalled her over, and told her that he loved her work. Then he asked for\nher room number so that he could call her to schedule a meeting."],["p","“That seemed pretty normal to me, you know, how people talk in business,\nand I didn’t know his reputation or anything,” Hannah said. She was in\nher room, already in her pajamas and getting ready for bed, when the\nphone calls started. “It felt like it was too late to have a meeting. I\ndidn’t want to answer.” Though she didn’t pick up, she guessed that it\nwas Weinstein. “And then, shortly thereafter, the knocking on the door\nbegan,” she told me. “It was sort of incessant, and then it started\nturning into pounding on my door,” she said. She was certain that it was\nWeinstein—as she recalls, she saw him through the peephole in the door.\nThe pounding became so frightening that Hannah, who was staying on the\nground floor, left her room via an exterior door. She spent the night in\nher makeup artist’s room. The following evening, Hannah was in her room\nwith the makeup artist, packing her things ahead of their departure the\nnext morning, when the pounding on the door began again. “The knocking\nstarted again and again. And I was like, ‘Oh, shit,’ ” Hannah recalled.\n“We actually pushed a dresser in front of the door and just kind of\nhuddled in the room.” The next morning, as they left, Weinstein was\nstanding outside the hotel, and appeared, she felt, to be waiting for\nher. She left quickly and went to the airport."],["p","Several years later, while she was promoting “Kill Bill: Volume 2,”\nHannah was in Rome for the film’s Italian première. She and the rest of\nthe cast were scheduled to depart the following morning on a private\nplane belonging to Miramax. The première was followed by a reception,\nafter which Hannah was in her suite at the  Hotel de Russie with\nanother hair-and-makeup artist, Steeve Daviault. The two had changed into\ntheir pajamas and were sitting on Hannah’s bed with an order of\nroom-service spaghetti, watching a Sophia Loren movie, when Weinstein\nentered the bedroom. “He had a key,” Hannah recalled. “He came through\nthe living room and into the bedroom.

When she arrived at the\nreception room Weinstein had mentioned, it was “completely empty,”\nHannah recalled. “And it wasn’t even like there had been a party there.\nI didn’t see drinks around.” As she turned to leave, Weinstein was\nstanding by the elevator. Hannah asked him what was happening and\nWeinstein replied, “Are your tits real?” Then he asked if he could feel\nthem. “I said, ‘No, you can’t!’ And then he said, ‘At least flash me,\nthen.’ And I said, ‘Fuck off, Harvey.’ ” She took the elevator back to\nher room and went to sleep."],["p","“I experienced instant repercussions,” she told me.

The\nactress Ellen Barkin told me that, though she was never a victim of\nWeinstein’s sexual advances, he frequently verbally abused her, calling\nher a “cunt” and “cunt bitch” during the filming of “Into the West,”\nwhich he produced. “The repercussions are real,” she said. “I was\nterrified Harvey was going to make it impossible to go back to work,\nwith those tentacles of his.” She continued, “This fear of losing your\ncareer is not losing your ticket to a borrowed dress and earrings\nsomeone paid you to wear.

of the women with allegations about Weinstein told me that the\nforces that kept them quiet continue to this day. Beginning in the early\nmonths of this year, Weinstein and his associates began calling women to\ndetermine who had spoken to the press. Three women who received those\ncalls said that they were\npressed for details about their communications with reporters. The calls\nnearly silenced them. In addition, Sciorra and several other individuals\nconnected to the story received calls from a man they believed was\nworking for Weinstein and posing as a journalist, who offered few\ndetails about himself and did not name any publication he was working\nfor. “He said he was doing a piece about how movies have changed in the\nlast thirty years, and I was like, ‘You fucker.’ ”"],["p","Sciorra and others said that Weinstein has a reputation for using the\npress to smear and intimidate people he sees as threats. “I’ve\nknown now for a long time how powerful Harvey became, and how he owned a\nlot of journalists and gossip columnists,” Sciorra told me. Three\nsources with knowledge of the activities of Miramax Books corroborated\nsome of Sciorra’s suspicions, saying that Weinstein would offer book\ndeals to gossip columnists. The implication, the sources felt, was that\nhe was trying to influence them. Weinstein’s reputation for manipulating\nthe media created an atmosphere of paranoia. During one of our\nconversations, Sciorra said to me, “As I was talking to you, I got\nscared that it wasn’t really you.”"],["p","The power of the tabloid press to help silence women has been\nunderscored in recent weeks. While there has been an enormous outpouring\nof support for those who have spoken out against Weinstein, there has\nalso been a backlash. Asia Argento, an Italian actress who alleged, in\nthe earlier ",["em","New Yorker"]," story, that Weinstein forcibly performed oral\nsex on her, and also described, in all its nuance, their ensuing\nrelationship, which included consensual sex, told me that, when she\ndecided to speak, she was knowingly sacrificing her reputation. “This\nwill completely destroy me,” she predicted."],["p","Since her story was made public, she has fled her native Italy,\nfollowing public shaming there. The journalist Renato Farina wrote an\narticle about her in the conservative daily ",["em","Libero"],", titled “First they\ngive it away, then they whine and pretend to repent.” In a radio\ninterview, the paper’s editor, Vittorio Feltri, said that Argento should\nbe thankful that Weinstein had forced oral sex on her. Some women",["inline-embed",{"type":"analytics","meta":"%7B%22type%22%3A%22analytics%22%2C%22url%22%3A%22final%22%2C%22width%22%3A%22%22%2C%22height%22%3A%22%22%2C%22caption%22%3A%22%22%7D","ref":""}]," joined\nthe chorus, including the commentator Selvaggia Lucarelli.

That there\nwould be some who would doubt me, mock me, even malign me. I knew this,”\nArgento told me this week. “But I was unprepared for the naked contempt,\nthe unapologetically hateful public shaming and vilification I received\nin my own country. Much of it from women. Women! . . . It hurt me. Badly.”"],["p","Sciorra said that the attacks on Argento and other accusers reinforced\nher fears about speaking out, but they also finally made her believe\nthat she had no choice but to do so. “The way they’re treating Asia, and\nthe way they’re treating a lot of women, is so infuriating,” she said.\nThe attempts to downplay the significance of Argento’s allegations made\nher realize the importance of her own story. “O.K., you want rape?” she\nsaid, addressing those commentators who questioned whether Argento’s\nexperience qualified. “Here’s fucking rape.”"],["p","Virtually all the women I talked to who were struggling with whether to\nspeak publicly said that advice from friends, loved ones, and colleagues\nwas a deciding factor. Sciorra was one of several who told me that those\nthey had consulted urged them to stay quiet. “I spoke with two people in\nthe business who I’ve known for a while, and they were very clearly\nagainst me saying anything,” she told me. “And they were people I always\nreally trusted and I respect. And they felt that no good could come out\nof it. Immediately, the response was ‘Stay as far away from this as\npossible.’ ”"],["p","Rosie Perez said that she urged Sciorra to speak by describing her own\nexperience of going public about her assault. “I told her, ‘I used to\ntread water for years. It’s fucking exhausting, and maybe speaking out,\nthat’s your lifeboat. Grab on and get out,’ ” Perez recalled. “I said,\n‘Honey, the water never goes away. But, after I went public, it became a\npuddle and I built a bridge over it, and one day you’re gonna get there,\ntoo.’

there is no more destructive force on this planet than water. Six inches of it, flowing at a mere seven miles per hour, will knock a grown man off his feet. Two feet of it will sweep away most cars. Two cubic yards of it weighs well over a ton; if that much of it hits you at, say, twenty miles per hour, it will do as much damage to your body as a Subaru. In rough seas, a regular ocean wave can break with a force of two thousand pounds per square foot, more than enough to snap a human neck. A rogue wave—one that is more than twice the height of those around it—can sink a nine-hundred-foot ship.\n\nKeep scaling up the water, and you keep scaling up the trouble. Eight years ago, a tsunami struck the northeast coast of Japan. A tsunami is not like a regular wave, and it is not like a rogue wave; it is more like a rogue ocean. It forms, most often, when an earthquake shifts the seabed and displaces all of the water above it. That displaced water does not crest and fall; it simply rises, like an extremely high tide, until the entire water column is in motion, from seafloor to surface. Then it rolls inland, with ten or twenty or sixty miles of similar waves at its back, and demolishes everything in its path. The tsunami that struck Japan swept over eighteen-foot protective barriers, rushed through towns and cities, and tore them apart, so that those towns and cities became part of the wave, cars and trucks and warehouses and real houses swirling in the water. It reached a hundred and thirty feet high at its apex, travelled up to six miles inland, and killed almost twenty thousand people. Seven years earlier, a similar tsunami rose up out of the Indian Ocean on the day after Christmas, poured outward to India, Sri Lanka, Thailand, and Indonesia, and left more than two hundred and eighty thousand people dead.\n\nFour years ago, I wrote [an article](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/the-really-big-one) for this magazine about a little-known fault line just off the coast of the Pacific Northwest that periodically produces earthquakes of magnitude 9 and greater—which, in turn, produce tsunamis equal in enormity to those that struck Indonesia and Japan. When that fault line next unleashes a full-scale quake, it will affect some hundred and forty thousand square miles of the West Coast. The impact of the tsunami, meanwhile, will be more localized but more thoroughgoing: it will obliterate everything inside a skinny swath of coastline, seven hundred miles long and up to three miles deep, from the northern border of California to southern Canada. That region is known as the tsunami-inundation zone, which is exactly what it sounds like: the area that, according to seismologists, will be completely underwater when the wave arrives. \n\nLast  week, the governor of Oregon signed a law that, among other things, overturns a 1995 prohibition on constructing new public facilities within the tsunami-inundation zone. When the law, known as HB 3309, goes into effect, municipalities will be free to build schools, hospitals, prisons, other high-occupancy buildings, firehouses, and police stations in areas that will be destroyed when the tsunami strikes. (Individuals and private entities were already allowed to build everything from hotels to nursery schools to nursing homes in the inundation zone.) Put differently, the law makes it perfectly legal to use public funds to place vulnerable populations—together with the people professionally charged with responding to emergencies and saving lives—in one of the riskiest places on earth. \n\nThat is not an exaggeration. If there is anything that my reporting on the Cascadia subduction zone made horrifyingly clear, it is that, when the tsunami hits, virtually nothing and almost no one within the inundation zone will survive. (“There aren’t many injuries in the tsunami zone,” one seismic expert with the Oregon Department of Geology and Mineral Industries, or *DOGAMI*{: .small}, told me at the time. “People just die.”) Those who are in it when the earthquake starts will have just ten to thirty minutes to evacuate—a timeframe that, however viable it might be under other circumstances, will be made desperately inadequate by the impact of the earthquake itself. That quake will leave people in the inundation zone—as across the Pacific Northwest—injured, in shock, and anxious to ascertain the safety of their colleagues, friends, and loved ones. In that condition, they will need to escape damaged or destroyed buildings and make their way to higher ground, despite crumpled roads, collapsed bridges, downed electrical lines, and all the secondary disasters an earthquake can trigger, from power outages and fires to landslides and liquefaction. \n\n+++inline-recirc\n+++\n\nAll that is bad enough. But when you factor in the kinds of obstacles that HB 3309 renders inevitable—being seven years old, say, or recovering from heart surgery, or sitting in an emergency room waiting for your broken leg to be X-rayed—a timely evacuation becomes next to impossible. Yet those who do not make it out of the inundation zone will not make it, period. When the tsunami hits the Oregon coast, it will be, at its lowest reaches, twenty feet high, and moving somewhere between ten and twenty miles per hour. Whatever the supporters of HB 3309 would have you believe, or are trying to convince themselves to believe, the fact of the matter is that, if schools and hospitals and prisons are built in the inundation zone, some of their occupants will still be there when that wave hits, and those who are will not survive. Schoolkids will die, together with their teachers. The sick and the injured will die, together with any hospital workers who stay to try to help them. As for the incarcerated, regardless of what sentences they are meant to be serving, they will be condemned to death by drowning.\n\nMeanwhile, by allowing police stations and firehouses to be built within the inundation zone, Oregon is directly endangering the people tasked with showing up when disaster strikes—and, in doing so, doubly abandoning everyone else to their fate. Even if first responders who are based in the inundation zone are able to evacuate, their equipment will be destroyed, leaving communities without the fire trucks and ambulances that they will so urgently need in the aftermath of the catastrophe. The same goes for putting hospitals in the inundation zone: in addition to gravely endangering all the patients, family members, and employees who are in them when the tsunami strikes, it means that, after the ground has stopped shaking and the water has receded, there will be no functioning medical facility to receive the injured and no advanced medical equipment on hand to help save lives. \n\n-=-=-=-\n\nHow did a law with such high stakes sail through the Oregon legislature, where Democrats hold a majority, with a combined eighty-four votes in favor and just five opposed? One answer is that HB 3309 was passed without any public input or formal debate. According to Jay Wilson, the current resilience coördinator for Clackamas County Disaster Management and a former chair of the Oregon Seismic Safety Policy Advisory Commission, even relevant state entities, O.S.S.P.A.C. included, were either discouraged or prevented from participating. The only public testimony came from the members of the Oregon Legislative Coastal Caucus, all but one of whom supported repealing the law—unsurprisingly, as the caucus has historically been antagonistic to mandatory measures to improve earthquake and tsunami safety. Indeed, some observers suspect that the law was largely designed to discredit and further defang the already underfunded *DOGAMI*{: .small}, the state entity that has done the lion’s share of work in mapping the tsunami-inundation zone and trying to keep critical infrastructure and vulnerable citizens out of it.  \n\nLast week, Republican Representative David Brock Smith, who voted in favor of HB 3309, likened the risk that Oregonians face from the tsunami to the risk Oklahomans face from tornadoes. It’s hard to say if he was being deliberately disingenuous or is simply ignorant, but, either way, the analogy is wildly wrong. Never mind, for a moment, the difference in scale between a mile-wide tornado and a seven-hundred-mile-long tsunami. To survive a tornado, you just need a tornado shelter; a simple cellar will suffice. To survive a tsunami in the inundation zone, you need a multimillion-dollar building constructed to the highest possible safety standards. But HB 3309 does not mandate that new buildings in the inundation zone meet those standards. \n\nThat’s probably because any genuinely useful building code would roughly double the price of construction—an outcome unlikely to appeal to lawmakers, many of whom cited economic reasons to explain their support for HB 3309. Back in April, Representative David Gomberg, a Democrat from Oregon’s central coast, championed the bill as a means of attracting and retaining residents in coastal communities. “Who will buy a house in a neighborhood too dangerous for a police station?” he asked. “Who will start a business in an area where fire stations are not allowed?” A better question would have been, Who would deliberately endanger their police and firefighters—to say nothing of their sick, their injured, and their children—in order to lure homeowners and businesses to an area that’s known to be so unsafe?\n\nWhat makes arguments like Gomberg’s particularly maddening is that they aren’t merely based on bad morals; they’re based on bad math. No matter how you crunch the numbers, it’s impossible to imagine any road to financial security that runs through the inundation zone. In places where there’s truly no other evacuation option available, it’s obviously better to have a tsunami-resistant building than nothing at all. But even if the political will suddenly materializes to mandate them, such buildings are expensive to construct, not always foolproof, and, if outcomes in Japan are any indication, likely to be abandoned and destroyed after the tsunami comes. A far better option is simply to start moving citizens and infrastructure out of harm’s way. However daunting the price tag on doing so might seem now, it pales in comparison to how much it will cost to *not* have done so by the time catastrophe strikes. (On average, every dollar invested in disaster mitigation saves six dollars in emergency response—and, out of all natural disasters, those involving water are by far the most expensive.) And that time might not be very far off: in the next fifty years, Oregon faces a one-in-three chance of experiencing a tsunami comparable to those that recently devastated Japan and Indonesia. If lawmakers truly want the state’s coastal communities to thrive, they need a fiscal vision that doesn’t amount to throwing taxpayer dollars—and taxpayers—into the ocean.  \n\nBut vision seems to be in short supply in the state of Oregon right now. The same day that the Democratic governor, Kate Brown, signed HB 3309 into law, the Democratic president of the Senate, Peter Courtney, announced the death of Oregon’s [landmark climate-policy bill](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/how-rogue-republicans-killed-oregons-climate-change-bill). The bill, which had already passed the House, would have capped carbon emissions in the state and required polluters to pay for greenhouse-gas emissions. Courtney’s announcement, which surprised and angered many of his colleagues, came after three Democratic senators refused to support the bill, and after the entire Republican senatorial caucus fled the state, deliberately making it impossible to achieve the necessary quorum to hold a vote. (One of those Republicans, Senator Brian Boquist, threatened to shoot any state troopers dispatched to bring him home. “Send bachelors,” he told Governor Brown, “and come heavily armed.”) Between the passage of the one bill and the failure of the other, Oregon’s message to its residents seems clear: we are turning our backs on danger; we are turning our backs on the future; we are turning our backs on you. That message is particularly upsetting because of how clearly it echoes the register of our times, how squarely it is in keeping with our era of reversals and regression, of failures to do and of undoing. \n\nMore than eight decades ago, [Robert Frost](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/robert-frost), that least sentimental of poets, conjured an everyday beach scene, happy and holiday-ish on its surface, full of people sprawled on the sand and gazing out toward the sea. Like so many of his poems, this one carries on for a while with deceptive simplicity, calmly taking in the terrain, pausing now and again to admire a seagull or a ship. But Frost, as he always did, saw through the daily condition to the existential one, and the poem ends, as this past week has, by reminding us of our terrible shortsightedness:\n\n>They cannot look out far.  \nThey cannot look in deep.  \nBut when was that ever a bar  \nTo any watch they keep?","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1cb541e4c73c088d77ca","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e1cb541e4c73c088d77ca","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Oregon","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"oregon"},{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"name":"Oregon","parent":[{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"},"slug":"oregon"},{"id":"5c2e1d65ee7fe02cbd163416","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e1d65ee7fe02cbd163416","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tsunami","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tsunami"},{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"name":"Tsunami","parent":[{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"},"slug":"tsunami"},{"id":"5c2e1cbd2710c62d1081548f","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e1cbd2710c62d1081548f","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Natural

As the shaking started, everyone in the room began to laugh. Earthquakes are common in Japan—that one was the third of the week—and the participants were, after all, at a seismology conference. Then everyone in the room checked the time.\n\n\n\n\n\nSeismologists know that how long an earthquake lasts is a decent proxy for its magnitude. The 1989 earthquake in Loma Prieta, California, which killed sixty-three people and caused six billion dollars’ worth of damage, lasted about fifteen seconds and had a magnitude of 6.9. A thirty-second earthquake generally has a magnitude in the mid-sevens. A minute-long quake is in the high sevens, a two-minute quake has entered the eights, and a three-minute quake is in the high eights. By four minutes, an earthquake has hit magnitude 9.0.\n\n\n\nWhen Goldfinger looked at his watch, it was quarter to three. The conference was wrapping up for the day. He was thinking about sushi. The speaker at the lectern was wondering if he should carry on with his talk. The earthquake was not particularly strong. Then it ticked past the sixty-second mark, making it longer than the others that week. The shaking intensified. The seats in the conference room were small plastic desks with wheels. Goldfinger, who is tall and solidly built, thought, No way am I crouching under one of those for cover. At a minute and a half, everyone in the room got up and went outside.\n\n\n\nIt was March. There was a chill in the air, and snow flurries, but no snow on the ground. Nor, from the feel of it, was there ground on the ground. The earth snapped and popped and rippled. It was, Goldfinger thought, like driving through rocky terrain in a vehicle with no shocks, if both the vehicle and the terrain were also on a raft in high seas. The quake passed the two-minute mark. The trees, still hung with the previous autumn’s dead leaves, were making a strange rattling sound. The flagpole atop the building he and his colleagues had just vacated was whipping through an arc of forty degrees. The building itself was base-isolated, a seismic-safety technology in which the body of a structure rests on movable bearings rather than directly on its foundation. Goldfinger lurched over to take a look. The base was lurching, too, back and forth a foot at a time, digging a trench in the yard. He thought better of it, and lurched away. His watch swept past the three-minute mark and kept going.\n\n\n\nOh, shit, Goldfinger thought, although not in dread, at first: in amazement. For decades, seismologists had believed that Japan could not experience an earthquake stronger than magnitude 8.4. In 2005, however, at a conference in Hokudan, a Japanese geologist named Yasutaka Ikeda had argued that the nation should expect a magnitude 9.0 in the near future—with catastrophic consequences, because Japan’s famous earthquake-and-tsunami preparedness, including the height of its sea walls, was based on incorrect science. The presentation was met with polite applause and thereafter largely ignored. Now, Goldfinger realized as the shaking hit the four-minute mark, the planet was proving the Japanese Cassandra right.\n\n\n\nFor a moment, that was pretty cool: a real-time revolution in earthquake science. Almost immediately, though, it became extremely uncool, because Goldfinger and every other seismologist standing outside in Kashiwa knew what was coming. One of them pulled out a cell phone and started streaming videos from the Japanese broadcasting station NHK, shot by helicopters that had flown out to sea soon after the shaking started. Thirty minutes after Goldfinger first stepped outside, he watched the tsunami roll in, in real time, on a two-inch screen.\n\n\n\nIn the end, the magnitude-9.0 Tohoku earthquake and subsequent tsunami killed more than eighteen thousand people, devastated northeast Japan, triggered the meltdown at the Fukushima power plant, and cost an estimated two hundred and twenty billion dollars. The shaking earlier in the week turned out to be the foreshocks of the largest earthquake in the nation’s recorded history. But for Chris Goldfinger, a paleoseismologist at Oregon State University and one of the world’s leading experts on a little-known fault line, the main quake was itself a kind of foreshock: a preview of another earthquake still to come.\n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nMost people in the United States know just one fault line by name: the San Andreas, which runs nearly the length of California and is perpetually rumored to be on the verge of unleashing “the big one.” That rumor is misleading, no matter what the San Andreas ever does. Every fault line has an upper limit to its potency, determined by its length and width, and by how far it can slip. For the San Andreas, one of the most extensively studied and best understood fault lines in the world, that upper limit is roughly an 8.2—a powerful earthquake, but, because the Richter scale is logarithmic, only six per cent as strong as the 2011 event in Japan.\n\n \n\n+++inset-left\n\n[#cartoon: /cartoon/593b63368a032b339a0cd470]||||||\n\n+++\n\n \n\n\n\nJust north of the San Andreas, however, lies another fault line. Known as the Cascadia subduction zone, it runs for seven hundred miles off the coast of the Pacific Northwest, beginning near Cape Mendocino, California, continuing along Oregon and Washington, and terminating around Vancouver Island, Canada. The “Cascadia” part of its name comes from the Cascade Range, a chain of volcanic mountains that follow the same course a hundred or so miles inland. The “subduction zone” part refers to a region of the planet where one tectonic plate is sliding underneath (subducting) another. Tectonic plates are those slabs of mantle and crust that, in their epochs-long drift, rearrange the earth’s continents and oceans. Most of the time, their movement is slow, harmless, and all but undetectable. Occasionally, at the borders where they meet, it is not.\n\n\n\nTake your hands and hold them palms down, middle fingertips touching. Your right hand represents the North American tectonic plate, which bears on its back, among other things, our entire continent, from One World Trade Center to the Space Needle, in Seattle. Your left hand represents an oceanic plate called Juan de Fuca, ninety thousand square miles in size. The place where they meet is the Cascadia subduction zone. Now slide your left hand under your right one. That is what the Juan de Fuca plate is doing: slipping steadily beneath North America. When you try it, your right hand will slide up your left arm, as if you were pushing up your sleeve. That is what North America is not doing. It is stuck, wedged tight against the surface of the other plate.\n\n\n\nWithout moving your hands, curl your right knuckles up, so that they point toward the ceiling. Under pressure from Juan de Fuca, the stuck edge of North America is bulging upward and compressing eastward, at the rate of, respectively, three to four millimetres and thirty to forty millimetres a year. It can do so for quite some time, because, as continent stuff goes, it is young, made of rock that is still relatively elastic. (Rocks, like us, get stiffer as they age.) But it cannot do so indefinitely. There is a backstop—the craton, that ancient unbudgeable mass at the center of the continent—and, sooner or later, North America will rebound like a spring. If, on that occasion, only the southern part of the Cascadia subduction zone gives way—your first two fingers, say—the magnitude of the resulting quake will be somewhere between 8.0 and 8.6. _That_’_s_ the big one. If the entire zone gives way at once, an event that seismologists call a full-margin rupture, the magnitude will be somewhere between 8.7 and 9.2. That’s the very big one.\n\n\n\nFlick your right fingers outward, forcefully, so that your hand flattens back down again. When the next very big earthquake hits, the northwest edge of the continent, from California to Canada and the continental shelf to the Cascades, will drop by as much as six feet and rebound thirty to a hundred feet to the west—losing, within minutes, all the elevation and compression it has gained over centuries. Some of that shift will take place beneath the ocean, displacing a colossal quantity of seawater. (Watch what your fingertips do when you flatten your hand.) The water will surge upward into a huge hill, then promptly collapse. One side will rush west, toward Japan. The other side will rush east, in a seven-hundred-mile liquid wall that will reach the Northwest coast, on average, fifteen minutes after the earthquake begins. By the time the shaking has ceased and the tsunami has receded, the region will be unrecognizable. Kenneth Murphy, who directs *FEMA*{: .small}’s Region X, the division responsible for Oregon, Washington, Idaho, and Alaska, says, “Our operating assumption is that everything west of Interstate 5 will be toast.”\n\n\n\nIn the Pacific Northwest, the area of impact will cover[*](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/the-really-big-one#correction) some hundred and forty thousand square miles, including Seattle, Tacoma, Portland, Eugene, Salem (the capital city of Oregon), Olympia (the capital of Washington), and some seven million people. When the next full-margin rupture happens, that region will suffer the worst natural disaster in the history of North America. Roughly three thousand people died in San Francisco’s 1906 earthquake. Almost two thousand died in Hurricane Katrina. Almost three hundred died in Hurricane Sandy. *FEMA*{: .small} projects that nearly thirteen thousand people will die in the Cascadia earthquake and tsunami. Another twenty-seven thousand will be injured, and the agency expects that it will need to provide shelter for a million displaced people, and food and water for another two and a half million. “This is one time that I’m hoping all the science is wrong, and it won’t happen for another thousand years,” Murphy says.\n\n\n\nIn fact, the science is robust, and one of the chief scientists behind it is Chris Goldfinger. Thanks to work done by him and his colleagues, we now know that the odds of the big Cascadia earthquake happening in the next fifty years are roughly one in three. The odds of the very big one are roughly one in ten. Even those numbers do not fully reflect the danger—or, more to the point, how unprepared the Pacific Northwest is to face it. The truly worrisome figures in this story are these: Thirty years ago, no one knew that the Cascadia subduction zone had ever produced a major earthquake. Forty-five years ago, no one even knew it existed. \n\n+++inset-left\n\n[#cartoon: /cartoon/593b63327206a168e2d176d1]||||||\n\n+++\n\n \n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nIn May of 1804, Meriwether Lewis and William Clark, together with their Corps of Discovery, set off from St. Louis on America’s first official cross-country expedition. Eighteen months later, they reached the Pacific Ocean and made camp near the present-day town of Astoria, Oregon. The United States was, at the time, twenty-nine years old. Canada was not yet a country. The continent’s far expanses were so unknown to its white explorers that Thomas Jefferson, who commissioned the journey, thought that the men would come across woolly mammoths. Native Americans had lived in the Northwest for millennia, but they had no written language, and the many things to which the arriving Europeans subjected them did not include seismological inquiries. The newcomers took the land they encountered at face value, and at face value it was a find: vast, cheap, temperate, fertile, and, to all appearances, remarkably benign.\n\n\n\n\n\nA century and a half elapsed before anyone had any inkling that the Pacific Northwest was not a quiet place but a place in a long period of quiet. It took another fifty years to uncover and interpret the region’s seismic history. Geology, as even geologists will tell you, is not normally the sexiest of disciplines; it hunkers down with earthly stuff while the glory accrues to the human and the cosmic—to genetics, neuroscience, physics. But, sooner or later, every field has its field day, and the discovery of the Cascadia subduction zone stands as one of the greatest scientific detective stories of our time.\n\n\n\nThe first clue came from geography. Almost all of the world’s most powerful earthquakes occur in the Ring of Fire, the volcanically and seismically volatile swath of the Pacific that runs from New Zealand up through Indonesia and Japan, across the ocean to Alaska, and down the west coast of the Americas to Chile. Japan, 2011, magnitude 9.0; Indonesia, 2004, magnitude 9.1; Alaska, 1964, magnitude 9.2; Chile, 1960, magnitude 9.5—not until the late nineteen-sixties, with the rise of the theory of plate tectonics, could geologists explain this pattern. The Ring of Fire, it turns out, is really a ring of subduction zones. Nearly all the earthquakes in the region are caused by continental plates getting stuck on oceanic plates—as North America is stuck on Juan de Fuca—and then getting abruptly unstuck. And nearly all the volcanoes are caused by the oceanic plates sliding deep beneath the continental ones, eventually reaching temperatures and pressures so extreme that they melt the rock above them.\n\n\n\nThe Pacific Northwest sits squarely within the Ring of Fire. Off its coast, an oceanic plate is slipping beneath a continental one. Inland, the Cascade volcanoes mark the line where, far below, the Juan de Fuca plate is heating up and melting everything above it. In other words, the Cascadia subduction zone has, as Goldfinger put it, “all the right anatomical parts.” Yet not once in recorded history has it caused a major earthquake—or, for that matter, any quake to speak of. By contrast, other subduction zones produce major earthquakes occasionally and minor ones all the time: magnitude 5.0, magnitude 4.0, magnitude why are the neighbors moving their sofa at midnight. You can scarcely spend a week in Japan without feeling this sort of earthquake. You can spend a lifetime in many parts of the Northwest—several, in fact, if you had them to spend—and not feel so much as a quiver. The question facing geologists in the nineteen-seventies was whether the Cascadia subduction zone had ever broken its eerie silence.\n\n\n\nIn the late nineteen-eighties, Brian Atwater, a geologist with the United States Geological Survey, and a graduate student named David Yamaguchi found the answer, and another major clue in the Cascadia puzzle. Their discovery is best illustrated in a place called the ghost forest, a grove of western red cedars on the banks of the Copalis River, near the Washington coast. When I paddled out to it last summer, with Atwater and Yamaguchi, it was easy to see how it got its name. The cedars are spread out across a low salt marsh on a wide northern bend in the river, long dead but still standing. Leafless, branchless, barkless, they are reduced to their trunks and worn to a smooth silver-gray, as if they had always carried their own tombstones inside them.\n\n\n\nWhat killed the trees in the ghost forest was saltwater. It had long been assumed that they died slowly, as the sea level around them gradually rose and submerged their roots. But, by 1987, Atwater, who had found in soil layers evidence of sudden land subsidence along the Washington coast, suspected that that was backward—that the trees had died quickly when the ground beneath them plummeted. To find out, he teamed up with Yamaguchi, a specialist in dendrochronology, the study of growth-ring patterns in trees. Yamaguchi took samples of the cedars and found that they had died simultaneously: in tree after tree, the final rings dated to the summer of 1699. Since trees do not grow in the winter, he and Atwater concluded that sometime between August of 1699 and May of 1700 an earthquake had caused the land to drop and killed the cedars. That time frame predated by more than a hundred years the written history of the Pacific Northwest—and so, by rights, the detective story should have ended there. \n\n+++inset-left\n\n[#cartoon: /cartoon/593b63336f669264efc138bd]||||||\n\n+++\n\n \n\n\n\nBut it did not. If you travel five thousand miles due west from the ghost forest, you reach the northeast coast of Japan. As the events of 2011 made clear, that coast is vulnerable to tsunamis, and the Japanese have kept track of them since at least 599 A.D. In that fourteen-hundred-year history, one incident has long stood out for its strangeness. On the eighth day of the twelfth month of the twelfth year of the Genroku era, a six-hundred-mile-long wave struck the coast, levelling homes, breaching a castle moat, and causing an accident at sea. The Japanese understood that tsunamis were the result of earthquakes, yet no one felt the ground shake before the Genroku event. The wave had no discernible origin. When scientists began studying it, they called it an orphan tsunami.\n\n\n\nFinally, in a 1996 article in _Nature_, a seismologist named Kenji Satake and three colleagues, drawing on the work of Atwater and Yamaguchi, matched that orphan to its parent—and thereby filled in the blanks in the Cascadia story with uncanny specificity. At approximately nine o’ clock at night on January 26, 1700, a magnitude-9.0 earthquake struck the Pacific Northwest, causing sudden land subsidence, drowning coastal forests, and, out in the ocean, lifting up a wave half the length of a continent. It took roughly fifteen minutes for the Eastern half of that wave to strike the Northwest coast. It took ten hours for the other half to cross the ocean. It reached Japan on January 27, 1700: by the local calendar, the eighth day of the twelfth month of the twelfth year of Genroku.\n\n\n\nOnce scientists had reconstructed the 1700 earthquake, certain previously overlooked accounts also came to seem like clues. In 1964, Chief Louis Nookmis, of the Huu-ay-aht First Nation, in British Columbia, told a story, passed down through seven generations, about the eradication of Vancouver Island’s Pachena Bay people. “I think it was at nighttime that the land shook,” Nookmis recalled. According to another tribal history, “They sank at once, were all drowned; not one survived.” A hundred years earlier, Billy Balch, a leader of the Makah tribe, recounted a similar story. Before his own time, he said, all the water had receded from Washington State’s Neah Bay, then suddenly poured back in, inundating the entire region. Those who survived later found canoes hanging from the trees. In a 2005 study, Ruth Ludwin, then a seismologist at the University of Washington, together with nine colleagues, collected and analyzed Native American reports of earthquakes and saltwater floods. Some of those reports contained enough information to estimate a date range for the events they described. On average, the midpoint of that range was 1701.\n\n\n\nIt does not speak well of European-Americans that such stories counted as evidence for a proposition only after that proposition had been proved. Still, the reconstruction of the Cascadia earthquake of 1700 is one of those rare natural puzzles whose pieces fit together as tectonic plates do not: perfectly. It is wonderful science. It was wonderful _for_ science. And it was terrible news for the millions of inhabitants of the Pacific Northwest. As Goldfinger put it, “In the late eighties and early nineties, the paradigm shifted to ‘uh-oh.’ ”\n\n\n\nGoldfinger told me this in his lab at Oregon State, a low prefab building that a passing English major might reasonably mistake for the maintenance department. Inside the lab is a walk-in freezer. Inside the freezer are floor-to-ceiling racks filled with cryptically labelled tubes, four inches in diameter and five feet long. Each tube contains a core sample of the seafloor. Each sample contains the history, written in seafloorese, of the past ten thousand years. During subduction-zone earthquakes, torrents of land rush off the continental slope, leaving a permanent deposit on the bottom of the ocean. By counting the number and the size of deposits in each sample, then comparing their extent and consistency along the length of the Cascadia subduction zone, Goldfinger and his colleagues were able to determine how much of the zone has ruptured, how often, and how drastically.\n\n\n\nThanks to that work, we now know that the Pacific Northwest has experienced forty-one subduction-zone earthquakes in the past ten thousand years. If you divide ten thousand by forty-one, you get two hundred and forty-three, which is Cascadia’s recurrence interval: the average amount of time that elapses between earthquakes. That timespan is dangerous both because it is too long—long enough for us to unwittingly build an entire civilization on top of our continent’s worst fault line—and because it is not long enough. Counting from the earthquake of 1700, we are now three hundred and fifteen years into a two-hundred-and-forty-three-year cycle.\n\n\n\nIt is possible to quibble with that number. Recurrence intervals are averages, and averages are tricky: ten is the average of nine and eleven, but also of eighteen and two. It is not possible, however, to dispute the scale of the problem. The devastation in Japan in 2011 was the result of a discrepancy between what the best science predicted and what the region was prepared to withstand. The same will hold true in the Pacific Northwest—but here the discrepancy is enormous. “The science part is fun,” Goldfinger says. “And I love doing it. But the gap between what we know and what we should do about it is getting bigger and bigger, and the action really needs to turn to responding. Otherwise, we’re going to be hammered. I’ve been through one of these massive earthquakes in the most seismically prepared nation on earth. If that was Portland”—Goldfinger finished the sentence with a shake of his head before he finished it with words. “Let’s just say I would rather not be here.” \n\n+++inset-left\n\n[#cartoon: /cartoon/593b6338c195de33cba58f08]||||||\n\n+++\n\n \n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nThe first sign that the Cascadia earthquake has begun will be a compressional wave, radiating outward from the fault line. Compressional waves are fast-moving, high-frequency waves, audible to dogs and certain other animals but experienced by humans only as a sudden jolt. They are not very harmful, but they are potentially very useful, since they travel fast enough to be detected by sensors thirty to ninety seconds ahead of other seismic waves. That is enough time for earthquake early-warning systems, such as those in use throughout Japan, to automatically perform a variety of lifesaving functions: shutting down railways and power plants, opening elevators and firehouse doors, alerting hospitals to halt surgeries, and triggering alarms so that the general public can take cover. The Pacific Northwest has no early-warning system. When the Cascadia earthquake begins, there will be, instead, a cacophony of barking dogs and a long, suspended, what-was-that moment before the surface waves arrive. Surface waves are slower, lower-frequency waves that move the ground both up and down and side to side: the shaking, starting in earnest.\n\n\n\n\n\nSoon after that shaking begins, the electrical grid will fail, likely everywhere west of the Cascades and possibly well beyond. If it happens at night, the ensuing catastrophe will unfold in darkness. In theory, those who are at home when it hits should be safest; it is easy and relatively inexpensive to seismically safeguard a private dwelling. But, lulled into nonchalance by their seemingly benign environment, most people in the Pacific Northwest have not done so. That nonchalance will shatter instantly. So will everything made of glass. Anything indoors and unsecured will lurch across the floor or come crashing down: bookshelves, lamps, computers, cannisters of flour in the pantry. Refrigerators will walk out of kitchens, unplugging themselves and toppling over. Water heaters will fall and smash interior gas lines. Houses that are not bolted to their foundations will slide off—or, rather, they will stay put, obeying inertia, while the foundations, together with the rest of the Northwest, jolt westward. Unmoored on the undulating ground, the homes will begin to collapse.\n\n\n\nAcross the region, other, larger structures will also start to fail. Until 1974, the state of Oregon had no seismic code, and few places in the Pacific Northwest had one appropriate to a magnitude-9.0 earthquake until 1994. The vast majority of buildings in the region were constructed before then. Ian Madin, who directs the Oregon Department of Geology and Mineral Industries (*DOGAMI*{: .small}), estimates that seventy-five per cent of all structures in the state are not designed to withstand a major Cascadia quake. *FEMA*{: .small} calculates that, across the region, something on the order of a million buildings—more than three thousand of them schools—will collapse or be compromised in the earthquake. So will half of all highway bridges, fifteen of the seventeen bridges spanning Portland’s two rivers, and two-thirds of railways and airports; also, one-third of all fire stations, half of all police stations, and two-thirds of all hospitals.\n\n\n\nCertain disasters stem from many small problems conspiring to cause one very large problem. For want of a nail, the war was lost; for fifteen independently insignificant errors, the jetliner was lost. Subduction-zone earthquakes operate on the opposite principle: one enormous problem causes many other enormous problems. The shaking from the Cascadia quake will set off landslides throughout the region—up to thirty thousand of them in Seattle alone, the city’s emergency-management office estimates. It will also induce a process called liquefaction, whereby seemingly solid ground starts behaving like a liquid, to the detriment of anything on top of it. Fifteen per cent of Seattle is built on liquefiable land, including seventeen day-care centers and the homes of some thirty-four thousand five hundred people. So is Oregon’s critical energy-infrastructure hub, a six-mile stretch of Portland through which flows ninety per cent of the state’s liquid fuel and which houses everything from electrical substations to natural-gas terminals. Together, the sloshing, sliding, and shaking will trigger fires, flooding, pipe failures, dam breaches, and hazardous-material spills. Any one of these second-order disasters could swamp the original earthquake in terms of cost, damage, or casualties—and one of them definitely will. Four to six minutes after the dogs start barking, the shaking will subside. For another few minutes, the region, upended, will continue to fall apart on its own. Then the wave will arrive, and the real destruction will begin.\n\n\n\nAmong natural disasters, tsunamis may be the closest to being completely unsurvivable. The only likely way to outlive one is not to be there when it happens: to steer clear of the vulnerable area in the first place, or get yourself to high ground as fast as possible. For the seventy-one thousand people who live in Cascadia’s inundation zone, that will mean evacuating in the narrow window after one disaster ends and before another begins. They will be notified to do so only by the earthquake itself—“a vibrate-alert system,” Kevin Cupples, the city planner for the town of Seaside, Oregon, jokes—and they are urged to leave on foot, since the earthquake will render roads impassable. Depending on location, they will have between ten and thirty minutes to get out. That time line does not allow for finding a flashlight, tending to an earthquake injury, hesitating amid the ruins of a home, searching for loved ones, or being a Good Samaritan. “When that tsunami is coming, you run,” Jay Wilson, the chair of the Oregon Seismic Safety Policy Advisory Commission (*OSSPAC*{: .small}), says. “You protect yourself, you don’t turn around, you don’t go back to save anybody. You run for your life.” \n\n\n+++inset-right\n[#externallink: /externallinks/5b4cfe2055a23a0b5421cd59]||||||\n+++\n\n\nThe time to save people from a tsunami is before it happens, but the region has not yet taken serious steps toward doing so. Hotels and businesses are not required to post evacuation routes or to provide employees with evacuation training. In Oregon, it has been illegal since 1995 to build hospitals, schools, firehouses, and police stations in the inundation zone, but those which are already in it can stay, and any other new construction is permissible: energy facilities, hotels, retirement homes. In those cases, builders are required only to consult with *DOGAMI*{: .small} about evacuation plans. “So you come in and sit down,” Ian Madin says. “And I say, ‘That’s a stupid idea.’ And you say, ‘Thanks. Now we’ve consulted.’ ”\n\n\n\nThese lax safety policies guarantee that many people inside the inundation zone will not get out. Twenty-two per cent of Oregon’s coastal population is sixty-five or older. Twenty-nine per cent of the state’s population is disabled, and that figure rises in many coastal counties. “We can’t save them,” Kevin Cupples says. “I’m not going to sugarcoat it and say, ‘Oh, yeah, we’ll go around and check on the elderly.’ No. We won’t.” Nor will anyone save the tourists. Washington State Park properties within the inundation zone see an average of seventeen thousand and twenty-nine guests a day. Madin estimates that up to a hundred and fifty thousand people visit Oregon’s beaches on summer weekends. “Most of them won’t have a clue as to how to evacuate,” he says. “And the beaches are the hardest place to evacuate from.”\n\n\n\nThose who cannot get out of the inundation zone under their own power will quickly be overtaken by a greater one. A grown man is knocked over by ankle-deep water moving at 6.7 miles an hour. The tsunami will be moving more than twice that fast when it arrives. Its height will vary with the contours of the coast, from twenty feet to more than a hundred feet. It will not look like a Hokusai-style wave, rising up from the surface of the sea and breaking from above. It will look like the whole ocean, elevated, overtaking land. Nor will it be made only of water—not once it reaches the shore. It will be a five-story deluge of pickup trucks and doorframes and cinder blocks and fishing boats and utility poles and everything else that once constituted the coastal towns of the Pacific Northwest.\n\n\n\nTo see the full scale of the devastation when that tsunami recedes, you would need to be in the international space station. The inundation zone will be scoured of structures from California to Canada. The earthquake will have wrought its worst havoc west of the Cascades but caused damage as far away as Sacramento, California—as distant from the worst-hit areas as Fort Wayne, Indiana, is from New York. *FEMA*{: .small} expects to coördinate search-and-rescue operations across a hundred thousand square miles and in the waters off four hundred and fifty-three miles of coastline. As for casualties: the figures I cited earlier—twenty-seven thousand injured, almost thirteen thousand dead—are based on the agency’s official planning scenario, which has the earthquake striking at 9:41 *A.M.*{: .small} on February 6th. If, instead, it strikes in the summer, when the beaches are full, those numbers could be off by a horrifying margin.\n\n\n\nWineglasses, antique vases, Humpty Dumpty, hip bones, hearts: what breaks quickly generally mends slowly, if at all. *OSSPAC*{: .small} estimates that in the I-5 corridor it will take between one and three months after the earthquake to restore electricity, a month to a year to restore drinking water and sewer service, six months to a year to restore major highways, and eighteen months to restore health-care facilities. On the coast, those numbers go up. Whoever chooses or has no choice but to stay there will spend three to six months without electricity, one to three years without drinking water and sewage systems, and three or more years without hospitals. Those estimates do not apply to the tsunami-inundation zone, which will remain all but uninhabitable for years.\n\n\n\nHow much all this will cost is anyone’s guess; *FEMA*{: .small} puts every number on its relief-and-recovery plan except a price. But whatever the ultimate figure—and even though U.S. taxpayers will cover seventy-five to a hundred per cent of the damage, as happens in declared disasters—the economy of the Pacific Northwest will collapse. Crippled by a lack of basic services, businesses will fail or move away. Many residents will flee as well. *OSSPAC*{: .small} predicts a mass-displacement event and a long-term population downturn. Chris Goldfinger didn’t want to be there when it happened. But, by many metrics, it will be as bad or worse to be there afterward.\n\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\nOn the face of it, earthquakes seem to present us with problems of space: the way we live along fault lines, in brick buildings, in homes made valuable by their proximity to the sea. But, covertly, they also present us with problems of time. The earth is 4.5 billion years old, but we are a young species, relatively speaking, with an average individual allotment of three score years and ten. The brevity of our lives breeds a kind of temporal parochialism—an ignorance of or an indifference to those planetary gears which turn more slowly than our own.\n\n\n\n\nThis problem is bidirectional. The Cascadia subduction zone remained hidden from us for so long because we could not see deep enough into the past. It poses a danger to us today because we have not thought deeply enough about the future. That is no longer a problem of information; we now understand very well what the Cascadia fault line will someday do. Nor is it a problem of imagination. If you are so inclined, you can watch an earthquake destroy much of the West Coast this summer in Brad Peyton’s “San Andreas,” while, in neighboring theatres, the world threatens to succumb to Armageddon by other means: viruses, robots, resource scarcity, zombies, aliens, plague. As those movies attest, we excel at imagining future scenarios, including awful ones. But such apocalyptic visions are a form of escapism, not a moral summons, and still less a plan of action. Where we stumble is in conjuring up grim futures in a way that helps to avert them.\n\n\n\nThat problem is not specific to earthquakes, of course. The Cascadia situation, a calamity in its own right, is also a parable for this age of ecological reckoning, and the questions it raises are ones that we all now face. How should a society respond to a looming crisis of uncertain timing but of catastrophic proportions? How can it begin to right itself when its entire infrastructure and culture developed in a way that leaves it profoundly vulnerable to natural disaster?\n\n\n\nThe last person I met with in the Pacific Northwest was Doug Dougherty, the superintendent of schools for Seaside, which lies almost entirely within the tsunami-inundation zone. Of the four schools that Dougherty oversees, with a total student population of sixteen hundred, one is relatively safe. The others sit five to fifteen feet above sea level. When the tsunami comes, they will be as much as forty-five feet below it.\n\n\n\nIn 2009, Dougherty told me, he found some land for sale outside the inundation zone, and proposed building a new K-12 campus there. Four years later, to foot the hundred-and-twenty-eight-million-dollar bill, the district put up a bond measure. The tax increase for residents amounted to two dollars and sixteen cents per thousand dollars of property value. The measure failed by sixty-two per cent. Dougherty tried seeking help from Oregon’s congressional delegation but came up empty. The state makes money available for seismic upgrades, but buildings within the inundation zone cannot apply. At present, all Dougherty can do is make sure that his students know how to evacuate.\n\n\n\nSome of them, however, will not be able to do so. At an elementary school in the community of Gearhart, the children will be trapped. “They can’t make it out from that school,” Dougherty said. “They have no place to go.” On one side lies the ocean; on the other, a wide, roadless bog. When the tsunami comes, the only place to go in Gearhart is a small ridge just behind the school. At its tallest, it is forty-five feet high—lower than the expected wave in a full-margin earthquake. For now, the route to the ridge is marked by signs that say “Temporary Tsunami Assembly Area.” I asked Dougherty about the state’s long-range plan. “There is no long-range plan,” he said.\n\n\n\nDougherty’s office is deep inside the inundation zone, a few blocks from the beach. All day long, just out of sight, the ocean rises up and collapses, spilling foamy overlapping ovals onto the shore. Eighty miles farther out, ten thousand feet below the surface of the sea, the hand of a geological clock is somewhere in its slow sweep. All across the region, seismologists are looking at their watches, wondering how long we have, and what we will do, before geological time catches up to our own. ♦ [](){:name=correction} \n\n\n\n*An earlier version of this article misstated the location of the area of impact.","canonicalUrl":"http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/the-really-big-one","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1cb6e56e652c902746bc","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Earthquakes","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"earthquakes"},{"id":"5c2e1cb6397f5b30646d063c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Seismology","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"seismology"}],"sections":[{"id":"5907ef591c7a8e33fb3891f6","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Annals of Seismology","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"annals-of-seismology"}]},"channel":"","contentSource":"magazine","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"5910a8aadf652b705f4a7587","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Kathryn Schulz joined *The New Yorker* as a staff writer in 2015.

Anticipating wide-scale chaos—like what might have befallen the world if most of its computers went berserk—made people in 1999 go a little nuts, but it also helped people plan, technologically and otherwise, and thus feel somewhat reassured in the run-up to the moment. It also helped people survive. A couple of survivalists who ran a wilderness school outside San Diego seemed deeply eccentric, even paranoid, for most of the series—sleeping outdoors for a decade, digging crawl spaces, tanning hides—until the wildfires of 2003 came. Because of their preparedness, they made it through; twelve of their neighbors didn’t.\n\n“[The Big One](https://the-big-one.scpr.org/),” a podcast that débuted yesterday from the Southern California NPR station KPCC, is riveting for similar reasons. It reminds us of a fact that we enjoy not thinking about: that the San Andreas Fault, which runs nearly the length of California, is due for a giant shakeup. A devastating earthquake could come any minute—or not for another several decades. Whenever it is, Los Angeles could be hit hard. “The Big One” aims to prepare the listener by explaining the likely destruction that such an earthquake would cause, its ripple effects, and its science. It’s the stuff of nightmares. But—even though it inspires a strong urge to avoid living in California—it’s also strangely reassuring.\n\nThe podcast, produced by Misha Euceph, is hosted by the KPCC science reporter Jacob Margolis. As the series begins, he takes us through a you-are-there scenario. (A similar mode is found in “[The Really Big One](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/20/the-really-big-one),” a piece, in this magazine, on the earthquake that could devastate the coastal Northwest.) Subtle music, suggesting anticipation, plays in the background. “Imagine you work in downtown L.A.—the heart of Los Angeles,” Margolis says. “Every morning, you wake up at your house in the suburbs, you walk to the train, and you make your way in. You’re headed to Union Station. You and a hundred thousand other people pass through here every day. Maybe you work in finance or in fashion.” This doesn’t sound like me, but O.K. “You say hey to the barista you’ve known for the past three years; you reach into your pocket for your wallet.” Not so fast, you and the barista—“There’s a monster beneath your feet, lying in wait,” and today, it strikes. A hundred and sixty miles away, in the desert, two massive tectonic plates slip against each other, sending a huge amount of energy through the earth. We hear the beginning of an earthquake—deep and ominous tremors—and it’s powerful listening. You imagine the underground plates and feel some tremors yourself. The seismologist Lucy Jones, a wise and down-to-earth expert who appears throughout the series, takes us through earthquake seismology, step by step. Margolis contextualizes and also keeps painting our narrative picture: the ground shakes harder and harder, you dive under a table, people fall to the ground; outside, car alarms go off. Then our scenario begins to rub me the wrong way. “You try to call your wife. And try again,” Margolis says. (I don’t want a wife!) “Panicked, you text, ‘Are you home? Are you O.K.?’&nbsp;” He puts some emotion into this delivery, which begins to feel manipulative—we don’t need to be coached to be scared here. “You can’t get ahold of your mom and dad, your sister, anyone you love.” O.K., O.K. “The shaking starts again.”\n\nIn the first few episodes, “The Big One” maintains this balance—mostly fascinating listening, full of illuminating science, history, and context, with occasional off notes. The strong parts dominate. We hear first-person accounts of the Northridge earthquake of 1994—not a big one—in which, we learn, a hundred thousand people were suddenly without homes, and bricks and glass rained down. (A doctor says that removing glass from feet was his most common post-earthquake request.) The third episode dives hard into the science; one charming story involves a junior at U.C. Riverside freaking out over seeing Charles Richter, of Richter-scale fame, at a 1970 local meeting of the Geological Society of America. The production consistently makes effective use of sound. Early on, just as I was noting to myself how much I was enjoying the show’s spare, satisfying use of stringed instruments—light tapping and humming, evocative of vibes in the earth—it suddenly made the instruments active characters, comparing “bows dragged against strings” to the shifting of tectonic plates, and indicating various earthquake magnitudes by playing a series of deepening, loudening double-bass notes. A little “[Peter and the Wolf](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zILQzPcEy24)”-ish for a podcast, perhaps, but I loved it.\n\nThe off notes, to me, are of two kinds. First, that occasional mild flirtation with scaring us, or being a little dramatic. (Or disgusting us, via imaginings of raw sewage and the like, sometimes in podcast-speak: “Shit’s? Streaming out.”) But with this subject the line between terror and education is thin; shocking us repeatedly is mostly legitimate and helps us understand. The show’s other off note is its point of view, which seems to presume an audience of educated, financially comfortable listeners: homeowners living in the suburbs, working in finance or fashion, saying hey to the barista. A conversation in Episode 2 between Margolis and his wife about their big-one worries has a similar tenor: they talk about possibly getting stranded during the workday, far from their nanny and son. In the fourth episode, Margolis and another reporter visit Unincorporated Palmdale, a neighborhood in a liquefaction zone, above the fault—a very dangerous place to be during an earthquake. The other reporter asks a man named Tyrone Jordan, “When you were choosing a home, was it kind of, like, ‘You gotta live *somewhere*?’&nbsp;” “Not at all,” Jordan says—he loves his neighborhood and his spacious house with a view of a lake. With obvious enthusiasm, he recalls the day he discovered it. You could ask much of the population of California, including people in fire-hazard zones, if they just gotta live *somewhere*—as well as many people all over the world. Later in that episode, you, the married homeowner, get a neighbor friend, Elle, who rents a town house, now inhabitable, which she lives in with her kids. She hasn’t heard from her landlord and has to leave town. I’m glad that the producers included a rental scenario, though I’m less glad that you seem to be better situated than your neighbor. I hope that later episodes continue to broaden in scope and respectfully acknowledge that you might be any kind of Californian.\n\nGenerally, “The Big One” effectively and engagingly helps us think about the unthinkable. Beyond possibly inspiring sales of nonperishable foods, bottled water, flashlights, batteries, radios, and sturdy tables, it provides listeners with something of ineffable value: an idea of what wide-scale devastation might look like and how, practically and psychologically, one might survive it. (I’m assuming that “you” will survive.) And, perhaps above all, it inspires gratitude for every day that the big one doesn’t come.

The horde of candidates had been split into two groups of ten, one group for each night, to make the format slightly less unwieldy, although the host, NBC News, added five moderators to the mix, which made for a lot of voices in the course of each debate’s two hours.\n\nAlthough the race has been under way for months, this week marked the moment, as Benjamin Wallace-Wells noted, when the “campaign has begun to operate on a national scale.” It was the first time many Americans heard from lesser-known candidates in the race, and watched the front-runners, including Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders, engage one another directly.  \n\nThe President, after declaring the first night’s debate “BORING!” on Twitter, fell silent, until he mocked the NBC News production for technical difficulties. Yet if Trump had been attuned to the first night’s substance, he might have seen what John Cassidy identified as a “serious discussion” on a wide range of issues, including the economy, health care, antitrust policy, [gun control](https://www.newyorker.com/news/current/2019-democratic-debate-elizabeth-warrens-caution-on-guns), dealing with the humanitarian crisis at the southern border, and the war in Afghanistan. Several other *New Yorker* writers pointed just how fully the progressive agendas of Sanders and Elizabeth Warren have come to set the terms of discussion for the Democrats heading into 2020. \n\nNo one could accuse the second night of being boring. In what Eric Lach described as the “first turning point of the Democratic Presidential election,” Senator Kamala Harris, of California, challenged Biden directly on his recent comments about working with segregationist colleagues, and his history, in the nineteen-seventies, of opposing federally-mandated school busing. Harris, the only African-American on the stage on Thursday, combined prosecutorial zeal and her own personal narrative to characterize Biden as out of touch on racial issues, before adding that busing policies had changed the lives of countless young students, including her own. In a widely shared sentiment, Wallace-Wells declared that she had “won the night.”\n\nBelow is *The New Yorker’s* complete coverage of the Democratic debates in Miami, and how they have set the stage for the race going forward.\n\n__The Second Debate, June 27th__\n\n[Joe Biden’s Faltering Performance Raises Big Doubts About His Campaign](https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/democratic-debate-2019-joe-bidens-faltering-performance-raises-big-doubts-about-his-campaign)\n\nThe debate raised fresh concerns about the former Vice-President’s preparation, age, grasp of the environment in which he is operating, and basic political skills.\n\n[Kamala Harris Exposed the Biden Weaknesses That Trump Will Exploit](https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/democratic-debate-2019-kamala-harris-exposed-the-biden-weaknesses-that-trump-will-exploit)\n\nThe coalition of voters needed to remove Trump from office will be drawn to the candidate who reminds them least of who we are at this moment and most of who we aspire to be.\n\n[Kamala Harris Won the Night](https://www.newyorker.com/news/current/democratic-debate-2019-kamala-harris-won-the-night)\n\nThe California senator’s remarks to Joe Biden on school integration marked a turning point in the Presidential race.\n\n[Kamala Harris Is the Best Storyteller on the Democratic Stag](https://www.newyorker.com/news/current/kamala-harris-is-the-best-storyteller-on-the-democratic-stage)e\n\nHer narrative instinct enabled her to frame the most powerful moment of the debate.\n\n[Kamala Harris Interrupts a “Food Fight](https://www.newyorker.com/news/current/kamala-harris-interrupts-a-food-fight-at-the-democratic-primary-debate)”\n\nThe second Democratic debate was much more dynamic than the first.\n\n[Kamala Harris: “I Would Like to Speak on the Issue of Race](https://www.newyorker.com/news/current/kamala-harris-i-would-like-to-speak-on-the-issue-of-race)”\n\nHarris directly addressed Biden’s recent comments about segregationists he once served with in the Senate, and his record on school busing.\n\n[Democratic Debate 2019: Andrew Yang’s Bold Lack of a Tie](https://www.newyorker.com/news/current/democratic-debate-2019-andrew-yangs-bold-lack-of-a-tie)\n\nAn open collar?

She turned to [Joe Biden](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/joe-biden), who, less than two weeks ago, had spoken warmly about his work across ideological lines with two of the last segregationists in the Senate. “I do not believe you are a racist,” she began. But then: “It was actually very hurtful to hear you talk about the reputations of two U.S. senators who built their reputations and careers on the segregation of race in this country. And it was not only that but you also worked with them to oppose busing.” Harris looked at Biden; Biden looked straight ahead. She described a little girl who had been part of the second class bused to integrate public schools in Berkeley, California. “That little girl was me.”\n\nThe rules gave Biden the chance to respond. “A mischaracterization of my position across the board,” Biden said. “I didn’t oppose busing in America.” But then he started to sound lawyerly. He had opposed only the intervention of the *federal Department of Education* in busing. In fact, Biden opposed busing, then and now; it was a federal policy, and without federal intervention, Berkeley and countless other places across the country would not have integrated their schools. Harris noted that she was part of her pioneering class “almost two decades after Brown v. Board of Education.” “Because your city council opposed it,” Biden replied. That remark made Harris’s point for her: a city council should not have veto power over civil rights. It was the first turning point of the Democratic Presidential race.\n\nThe essential arguments of Thursday night’s Presidential-primary debate were about the past. The explicit argument between Biden and Harris was over the racial politics of the nineteen-seventies; the implicit one was about which of them could claim the legacy of Barack Obama. Biden invoked his former boss early and often. “Build on what we did,” Biden said, and later he praised Obama for having done a “heckuva job.” But, although Biden may have some claim on the underlying reasonableness of the Obama years, he has little relation to Obama’s political character—on his sense of justice, his introspection, and his transformative promise. Just before the debate began, the cameras had captured nine candidates scribbling notes. Biden was just calmly looking around. \n\nIn randomly assigning Presidential candidates to each night’s debate, the Democratic Party did not divide its talents evenly. Thursday night got almost all of the front-runners, and also the personalities: the slightly spacy Marianne Williamson, the interrupting [Kirsten Gillibrand](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/kirsten-gillibrand). Things got a little shouty, twenty minutes in, when Eric Swalwell, a young congressman from California, challenged Biden to pass the generational torch. The candidates shouted over each other—“As part of Joe’s generation, let me respond,” Sanders said—until Harris, not for the last time, seized the stage. “Hey, guys, you know what? America does not want to witness a food fight,” she said. \n\nHarris, long presumed to be a front-runner, was not at her best during the first months of the Presidential campaign, when the candidates began to introduce policy proposals. Hers had a slightly speculative feel: early on, she came out in favor of abolishing private health insurance, though she did little to explain why. But now we are beginning the next phase, perhaps a full year of regular debates, and Harris, a former prosecutor, and the most vigorous interrogator on the Judiciary Committee, stands out. Her language, more than any of the others’, is direct; she has an oppositional energy. What would Harris do on her first day in office? “Release children from cages,” she said. In recent weeks, it was possible to imagine that a three-way contest was emerging, between Biden, Elizabeth Warren, and Sanders. Reread Harris’s statements about race on Thursday night and some of them seem aimed at all three of them. “I will tell you,” Harris said, “that on this subject it cannot be an intellectual debate.”","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c7e22d4972cd5b8329b","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"2020 Election","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"2020-election"},{"id":"5c2e1d7b4a08312cd3aa6d36","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Kamala Harris","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"kamala-harris"},{"id":"5c2e1d317e716b454591ae56","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Race Relations","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"race-relations"},{"id":"5c2e2590d534212cdfecc712","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Busing","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"busing"}],"sections":[{"id":"59f0d2a0d2beb9720f019591","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"The Current","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"current"}]},"channel":"News","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"5910a847dd6207318b5db956","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Benjamin Wallace-Wells began contributing to *The New Yorker* in 2006 and joined the magazine as a staff writer in 2015.

In this instance, though, his grouse was at least comprehensible.\n\nThe opening part of the debate had been interesting in many ways, one of which being how little the President featured in it. By directing the first question at Elizabeth Warren, and making it about whether her extensive suite of policy proposals, including major changes to taxation, health care, and regulation, represented a risk to the economy, Savannah Guthrie, of NBC News, gave the Massachusetts senator a chance to define the terms of the debate. Warren [seized the opportunity](https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/at-the-democratic-debate-elizabeth-warrens-reformism-versus-trumps-moral-crisis). She has based her campaign on the theory that Trump is the symptom rather than the cause of America’s malaise. Quickly and clearly, she laid out the argument.\n\nThe economy is “doing great for giant drug companies,” Warren said, her voice urgent. “It’s just not doing great for people who are trying to get a prescription filled.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. It’s doing great for giant oil companies that want to drill everywhere, just not for the rest of us who are watching climate change bear down upon us.” Not mentioning Trump by name, she went on, “When you’ve got an economy that does great for those with money and isn’t doing great for everyone else, that is corruption, pure and simple. We need to call it out. We need to attack it head on. And we need to make structural change in our government, in our economy, and in our country.”\n\nThere followed a series of [substantive exchanges on issues](https://www.newyorker.com/news/current/moderate-democrats-surprising-embrace-of-elizabeth-warren-at-the-democratic-debate): the economy, health care, antitrust policy, [gun control](https://www.newyorker.com/news/current/2019-democratic-debate-elizabeth-warrens-caution-on-guns), dealing with the humanitarian crisis at the southern border, and the war in Afghanistan, where two American troops were killed on Wednesday. In the course of two hours, we heard at some length from all ten candidates on the stage, and at least five of them—Warren, Julián Castro, Cory Booker, Bill de Blasio, and Jay Inslee—probably did themselves some good in the horse race. We also witnessed the first serious one-on-one altercation of the primary campaign, as Castro, the former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development under Obama, sought to school [Beto O’Rourke](https://www.newyorker.com/news/current/beto-orourkes-spanish-moment-at-the-democratic-debate), his fellow-Texan, on the laws governing the treatment of separated children at the border. (CNN’s Van Jones described this exchange as a “Texas takedown.”)\n\nBut it was the progressive agenda outlined by Warren—and also by de Blasio, a vocal presence all night—that dominated the debate, or the first half of it, anyway. After delivering her initial diagnosis of the problem, Warren defended the various remedial measures she has put forward, including dismantling the likes of Facebook and Google, and supporting Bernie Sanders’s Medicare for All legislation. “Look at the business model of an insurance company,” she said. “It’s to bring in as many dollars as they can in premiums and to pay out as few dollars as possible for your health care. That leaves families with rising premiums, rising co-pays, and fighting with insurance companies to try to get the health care that their doctors say that they and their children need. Medicare for All solves that problem.” \n\nSeveral of the candidates on the stage have refused to support Medicare for All, including Amy Klobuchar, the moderate senator from Minnesota; John Delaney, the former Maryland congressman; and O’Rourke. Given the chance to take issue with Warren and the Medicare for All proposal, Klobuchar confined her answer to one sentence: “I am just simply concerned about kicking half of America off of their health insurance in four years, which is exactly what this bill says.” O’Rourke, who has offered his own health-care plan, engaged with the issue at greater length. He and Delaney both said that enrollment in Medicare should be offered to people as an option alongside private insurance, rather than as a replacement.\n\nDe Blasio wasn’t having that. Interrupting the Texan, he said, “Congressman O’Rourke, private insurance is not working for tens of millions of Americans. When you talk about the co-pays, the deductibles, the premiums, the out-of-pocket expenses, it’s not working. How can you defend a system that’s not working?” O’Rourke started to respond, but it was Delaney, widely regarded as having no hope in the primaries, who intervened with the strongest argument against embracing Medicare for All. “One hundred million Americans say they like their private health insurance,” he said. “I mean, I think we should be the party that keeps what’s working and fixes what’s broken.”\n\nWhichever side one takes in this debate, its seriousness and importance can’t be doubted. Something similar could be said of the dispute between Castro and O’Rourke on how to resolve the situation at the border, and of the other candidates’ exchanges on a number of other issues, including gun control and tackling climate change. After two and a half years of White House histrionics, administrative incompetence, and policymaking by tweet, it was strangely refreshing to see a group of career politicians, many of whom have spent years studying policy issues, having a serious discussion.\n\nLargely absent were rote attacks on Trump, or a lengthy regurgitation of the debate about whether he should be impeached. It was as if the Democrats had agreed in advance that they wouldn’t spend their precious time in the national spotlight giving their nemesis the attention he so craves, and which he has used to great personal advantage. Of course, they brought up his name when they criticized his policies on immigration, the environment, Iran, and other issues. But they largely avoided personal invective, and their attitude appeared to signal general agreement with Booker, who said, “Donald Trump wants us to fight him on his turf and his terms. We will beat him, I will beat him, by calling this country to a sense of common purpose again.”\n\nTo a chronic narcissist like Trump, the fact that he wasn’t the focal point must have made the proceedings virtually unwatchable. After delivering his initial all-caps verdict, he confined himself to one more tweet, in which he taunted NBC News for technical difficulties that delayed the start of the second hour for a few minutes. This snafu was a bit embarrassing for the network, to be sure, but it didn’t detract from the reassuring message of the evening: there is a lot more to Presidential politics than Trump.","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1ffc41c92e2c9b85dcd9","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Democratic Primary","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"democratic-primary"},{"id":"5c2e1e982bfcc72cd92d0718","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Debate","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"debate"},{"id":"5c2e1c774a08312cd3aa6c36","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Elizabeth Warren","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"elizabeth-warren"},{"id":"5c2e1c762bfcc72cd92d051d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Donald Trump","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"donald-trump"}],"sections":[{"id":"59ef6620c6604764e97c762c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Our Columnists","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"our-columnists"}]},"channel":"News","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"5909e8fb8b51cf59fc4246ae","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"John Cassidy has been a staff writer at *The New Yorker* since 1995.

She was anxious and deeply concerned. “This might be a really sad day for us,” she said, en route. A major [climate-change](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/climate-change) [bill](https://olis.leg.state.or.us/liz/2019R1/Measures/Analysis/HB2020), which she had worked on for the last several years, was on the verge of passing the state legislature, which, since last year’s midterm elections, has been controlled by a supermajority of Democrats. Governor Kate Brown, a Democrat, had campaigned on its policies, and planned to sign it. On climate policy, Brown had [said](https://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-oregon-climate-policy-cap-and-trade-20190617-story.html), “Oregon can be the log that breaks the jam nationally.” Then, last week, eleven Republican state senators walked out of the statehouse, fled the capitol, and apparently hid out of state, in order to deny the rest of the Senate the necessary twenty-person quorum required to move the bill to a vote. Representatives of fringe right-wing militia groups said that they would protect the state senators “at any cost,” and that protesters supporting the bill at the capitol should be warned of their presence. “Our bill might die,” Joshi said. “What these senators are doing is anarchistic. It’s scary. There are no rules anymore.”\n\nIn Salem, Joshi and her high-school group, along with other young activists, staged a sit-in outside the office of the Senate president, the Democrat Peter Courtney. Joshi and other organizers had heard that Courtney was prepared to trade away the bill in order to bring the Republicans back to the statehouse. “For him to just undercut us that way was a real blow,” she said. “We fought for so long and created a really strong program with pretty broad support across the state.” The oldest farm workers’ union in the state, for instance, joined Renew Oregon’s steering committee, in part because of “the immense pressures that climate impacts put on their workers,” Joshi said. (The average life expectancy of an Oregon farmworker is forty-nine years.) After lengthy negotiations, public meetings, and citizens’ comments, the bill also gained backing from all nine of the state’s federally recognized Native American tribes, the state’s electric utilities, who were, at first, opposed, and corporations in the state including Nike and Uber. As of eleven days ago, widespread consensus existed that the bill would pass. “We had the votes last week,” the state senator Michael Dembrow, one of the bill’s co-authors, told me on Tuesday. \n\nThe main goal of the bill is to set up a cap-and-trade program that will dramatically and rapidly lower greenhouse-gas emissions across the entire economy, reaching an eighty-per-cent reduction below 1990 levels by 2050. The state government would establish a certain amount of permits, called allowances, which companies could buy for every ton of carbon dioxide (or its equivalent) that they emitted; over time, the total number of allowances would decrease, forcing companies to adopt technology that would steadily reduce over-all pollution levels. Companies would also be allowed to buy and sell allowances in regular auctions. Money raised from the program would be invested in further emissions-reduction and climate-mitigation measures across the state, focussing on low-income, rural, and tribal communities that are most vulnerable and least able to prepare for the increasingly severe weather that will hit as temperatures continue to rise. The bill also sets aside ten million dollars every two years to protect workers in transportation and manufacturing, who could face layoffs. (Provisions included unemployment benefits and transition programs, such as training for clean-energy jobs, which will be required, also under the law, to feature competitive wages and benefits.) \n\nCriticism of the bill initially came from both sides of the political aisle. Some environmental-justice advocates on the left were concerned that the program would allow companies to fulfill up to eight per cent of their compliance obligations by purchasing [carbon-offset credits](https://www.newyorker.com/news/dispatch/how-carbon-trading-became-a-way-of-life-for-californias-yurok-tribe) from forestry projects, which must show that, through their management practices, they are sequestering greater amounts of CO~2~ from the atmosphere than whatever was there before. Offset programs, critics say, let power plants and industry increase pollution in certain communities while buying offsets elsewhere, and have a troubled compliance record. \n\nThe much more vocal criticism, on the right, came from manufacturing companies, truckers, small-business owners, and farm owners, who said that the program would raise fuel prices and energy bills. In response to their concerns, Dembrow and Representative Karin Power made compromises; the bill would subsidize ninety-five per cent of the allowances for companies that are particularly trade-exposed (paper mills, aluminum, concrete, and food processing), which are the most vulnerable to energy-cost increases. It’s true that a cap-and-trade bill would increase energy costs slightly. “That’s how they send signals in the market, and that’s how the market works,” Leah Stokes, an assistant professor in the department of political science at the University of California, Santa Barbara, and the author of a forthcoming book on the battle over climate policy in American states, told me. That’s also, she said, “why cap-and-trade and carbon taxes have struggled to get passed around the world.” She pointed out that, in this country, decades of wage stagnation and growing inequality have led to a situation where people—like those in rural areas in Oregon—do not have enough money to pay their monthly bills. “That’s why you have to think about climate policy in more systemic ways, protect people, bring them along in transition.” The Oregon bill, she said, did that, by taking money from the cap and investing it in the transition. \n\nNevertheless, last Thursday, the Senate’s Republican leader, Herman Baertschiger, announced that his caucus would take action to prevent the cap-and-trade bill’s passage. Governor Brown said she would respond by calling for a special legislative session, and, if necessary, was willing to ask for state troopers to help return the missing lawmakers to Salem. Afterward, the Republican senator Brian Boquist said in a local television-news interview that he had spoken to the Oregon State Police’s superintendent and told him, “Send bachelors and come heavily armed. I’m not going to be a political prisoner in the state of Oregon. It’s just that simple.”\n\nThe next day, June 20th, when the cap-and-trade bill was up for a vote, the Republican senators did not arrive for the 11 *A.M.*{: .small} legislative session. Courtney asked the sergeant-at-arms to search for the missing members. They were nowhere to be found. He then asked Governor Brown to dispatch state troopers to find the senators and bring them back to the capitol to do their job. “It is absolutely unacceptable that the Senate Republicans would turn their back on their constituents who they are honor-bound to represent here in this building,” Brown said. “They need to return and do the jobs they were elected to do.” Boquist’s wife, Peggy, [told CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/20/politics/kate-brown-oregon-republican-senators-police-climate-change/index.html) that the eleven senators were together, hiding in Idaho. Representative Tim Knopp, a Republican, said that he had been hiding in three different states over three days. Meanwhile, Carol Williams, a resident of Silverton, Oregon, created a GoFundMe [page](https://www.gofundme.com/Encourage-the-walking-senators) called “Encourage the Walking Senators.” (As of Thursday, eight hundred and twenty-one people had raised $43,307 in seven days.)\n\nOn Friday, members of right-wing militia groups including the Three Percenters of Oregon, who took part in [the 2016 takeover](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/01/25/bundynomics) of Oregon’s Malheur National Wildlife Refuge, posted a different form of encouragement on social media, saying that they were willing to provide the hiding senators “security” and “refuge.” They also appeared to be organizing a weekend protest at the capitol, scheduled for when lawmakers gathered on Saturday. A commenter on Facebook [offered](https://expo.oregonlive.com/news/g66l-2019/06/ff0f90f6211918/militia-offer-oregon-senators-security-republicans-arent-accepting-the-help.html) to bring “a few pickup loads of manure” to drop on the capitol’s steps. An unnamed source [told](https://www.thedailybeast.com/armed-militias-pledge-to-fight-for-fugitive-oregon-gop-lawmakers-at-any-cost) Will Sommer, of the Daily Beast, that “dozens of armed militia members have ‘mobilized’ to protect the state senators, and said there was potential for violence if law enforcement officials try to bring the senators back to Oregon.” In response, Oregon state troopers recommended that the capitol be closed on Saturday “due to a possible militia threat,” [according to](https://www.oregonlive.com/politics/2019/06/militia-threat-shuts-down-oregon-statehouse.html) a spokeswoman from the Senate president’s office. \n\nStatehouse walkouts remain a rare tactic nationally. They had a brief history in Oregon before 2019; the last walkout in the state was in 2001, when House Democrats left the capitol building and hid for nearly a week to prevent a vote on a Republican redistricting bill. But since the 2018 elections, the outnumbered Republicans have now resorted to the undemocratic tactic twice, previously in early May, when they walked out in order to protest legislation on education funding that they opposed. (The state troopers were not sent to [track](https://www.oregonlive.com/politics/2019/06/oregon-governor-sends-police-to-find-missing-republicans-bring-them-to-capitol.html) them down in that instance.) They eventually returned, and the bill was passed, but only in exchange for the tabling of a vaccine bill and a gun-reform bill. There have been walkouts in other statehouses (notably, Texas and Wisconsin), where the quorum for legislative functioning is also high. But the use of a procedural fluke by Oregonian Republicans should not overshadow what the move signals about the future of climate legislation. “It’s so dark and depressing,” Stokes said. “If you want to stop the transition” to a carbon-neutral economy, “there are about a thousand ways you can do it. That’s what fossil-fuel companies have been doing for decades. You don’t need just a little rule in Oregon to screw things up.”\n\nFortunately, there are some good signs in terms of national progress. In the 2018 midterms, more than six hundred local, state, and federal candidates, including ten new governors, included a commitment to a hundred per cent clean energy in their platforms, and won. Recently, six states—Colorado, Maine, Maryland, New Mexico, New Jersey, and New York—have followed through on what their voters supported, and passed major climate legislation with bipartisan support. South Carolina also passed an important solar-power bill, unanimously, in a Republican-controlled statehouse. Illinois has a hundred-per-cent clean-energy bill pending, with strong policies that would address adaptation and first-line communities. New York’s bill, which legislators agree to pass last week, is the most ambitious of the group, setting a target for net-zero greenhouse-gas emissions by 2050. “The underlying goal of each legislation is the same,” Sara Jordan, the clean-energy program director for the League of Conservation Voters, told me. “They each significantly tackle climate pollution and quickly move that state to a clean-energy economy.” \n\nBack at the Oregon statehouse, on Tuesday, the youth activists—several wearing T-shirts that read “I will be 26,” or 27 or 28, “when my climate fate is sealed,”—chanted, “The people united can never be divided!” and “What do we want? Climate justice! When do we want it? Now.” Their shirts, and their presence—like the participants in the FridaysForFuture school-strikes movement, led by [Greta Thunberg](https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-uncanny-power-of-greta-thunbergs-climate-change-rhetoric), and the youth plaintiffs in a [climate lawsuit](https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-right-to-a-stable-climate-is-the-constitutional-question-of-the-twenty-first-century) against the federal government—were a reminder of the stakes of the climate crisis. In last year’s landmark United Nations climate report, scientists stated that, in order to avoid the most catastrophic impacts of climate change, we have no more than twelve years to take action and pass laws that dramatically transform and decarbonize our energy infrastructure. In Oregon alone, the impacts of climate change—devastating wildfires and the resultant polluting smoke, ocean acidification, increasingly extreme and variable precipitation patterns—are already having severely adverse effects on public health, ecosystems, and the economy.\n\nBy the end of the day Tuesday, Courtney had not addressed the bill’s supporters, or the youth activists that had sat outside his office and then joined more activists on the capitol’s steps for a rally in the afternoon. Instead, he claimed that the Senate no longer had the votes to pass the bill; they needed sixteen of the eighteen Democrats, and, according to the *Oregonian*, one additional Democrat was now holding out. If it was an attempt to get the Republicans to return, as of Thursday morning, they were still not back at the statehouse; it seemed that certain Republican senators were now using their leverage to oppose legislation related to a tax that would fund education. Either way, Courtney, and even the governor, acknowledged that the bill was, at least for now, dead. “I’m frustrated,” Dembrow said. “This is not how the system is supposed to work. I had a lot of bills that I wanted to get passed this session that did not. But my job as a legislator is to come in and keep working.” He went on, “If we start walking out every time policies move forward that we disagree with, and that we cannot convince the majority of colleagues to agree with us on, and we just stay away, how do we have a government that way? A democratic government? I just hope it doesn’t spread.”","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1cb541e4c73c088d77ca","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e1cb541e4c73c088d77ca","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Oregon","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"oregon"},{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"name":"Oregon","parent":[{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"},"slug":"oregon"},{"id":"5c2e1c772bfcc72cd92d0520","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e1c772bfcc72cd92d0520","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Climate

Oregon, Judge Andrew Hurwitz, of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, posed an unusual hypothetical question. “Assume that we have rogue raiders come across the Canadian border of the Northwest. They are kidnapping children of a certain age and murdering them,” he said. “The White House refuses to do anything and Congress doesn’t act. Can those people”—the terrorized families and communities—“go to court to compel action?” He was asking Jeff Clark, the lawyer representing the federal government, the defendant in the case. Clark replied, “My answer is no.”\n\nJudge Hurwitz, along with Judges Mary Murguia and Josephine Staton, was presiding over oral arguments in Kelsey Cascadia Rose Juliana v. the United States, better known as the climate kids’ lawsuit. In August of 2015, the twenty-one plaintiffs, who then ranged in age from eight to nineteen years old, sued the Obama Administration and various federal agencies, alleging that the government’s policies on fossil fuels advanced catastrophic climate change and therefore violated the right, guaranteed to them under the Fifth Amendment, that no one shall be “deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.” In other words, as Judge Hurwitz’s hypothetical suggested, their suit is an attempt to compel action from a government that is ignoring (and furthering) a life-threatening danger that they face. Since then, the case has ricocheted through the courts, gaining strength as urgency around climate change has increased and the Trump Administration has continued to deny that a problem exists. (“The climate goes both ways,” President Trump said in London, last week. “I believe that there’s a change in weather and I think it changes both ways.”) Instead, the Administration has aggressively promoted and expanded the use of fossil fuels, recently announcing that natural gas would be rebranded as “freedom gas.”\n\nHurwitz asked his question at the start of the hearing, establishing the stakes and reflecting the gravity with which the judges were weighing the plaintiffs’ claims. It pointed to an issue at the heart of the case, and at the heart of most climate litigation—the separation of powers. “The central issue the Ninth Circuit is grappling with is what is the role of the courts vis a vis Congress and the executive branch,” Michael Gerrard, a professor at Columbia Law School and the faculty director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law, wrote me in an e-mail. “If a building is on fire and all the firefighters are off at a convention, can the neighbors break into the firehouse and run the firetrucks themselves? Or do they have to wait for permission, while the building burns down? Likewise, if the planet is on fire and Congress and the Administration are checked out, can the courts act on their own?”\n\nSince most major environmental statutes date to the nineteen-seventies, and Congress has not been able to pass a single major environmental law since 1990, the Environmental Protection Agency, other federal agencies, and the courts have been forced to address current problems with laws that are decades old. (The main problem now is that the Senate will not act. In early May, as the House prepared to vote on a new bill, the Climate Action Now Act, which would force the Trump Administration to remain in the Paris climate agreement, the Senate Majority Leader, Mitch McConnell, said that it would “go nowhere.”) Once Trump was elected, and federal agencies no longer had a mandate to address climate change, the courts became the only branch of government where action might be possible. But, in the absence of adequate climate-policy laws, the courts must find their right to act in the Constitution. Two days after Trump’s election, a federal judge for the District of Oregon, Ann Aiken, found that right and issued a major decision, denying the government’s motion to dismiss the Juliana case. “Where a complaint alleges governmental action is affirmatively and substantially damaging the climate system in a way that will cause human deaths, shorten human lifespans, result in widespread damage to property, threaten human food sources, and dramatically alter the planet’s ecosystem, it states a claim for a due process violation,” Aiken wrote. “I have no doubt that the right to a climate system capable of sustaining human life is fundamental to a free and ordered society.” A trial date was set for early last year, then postponed until last fall. The government, meanwhile, turned to the Supreme Court, asking the Justices to prevent the trial from going forward. In November, they declined to do so, determining that the government needed to bring its objections before the Ninth Circuit first. The Ninth Circuit now must decide whether the case can, finally, proceed to trial. \n\nDuring the hearing, Jeff Clark, from the Justice Department, argued that there is no substantive constitutional right to a stable environment. Julia Olson, the co-lead attorney for the plaintiffs and the executive director of Our Children’s Trust, a group that has been bringing climate-litigation cases around the country, argued that the government misunderstood the plaintiffs’ claims. She said, “The Supreme Court has already recognized that the liberties that we all hold include our right to bodily integrity and personal security and family autonomy. So this court doesn’t need to step out of bounds and recognize any kind of new right, it can stick with the bedrock fundamental rights that we all—” At this point, Judge Hurwitz interrupted her, saying, “Actually, to be fair, you’re arguing for us to break new ground.” He added, “I’m sympathetic to the problems you point out, but you shouldn’t minimize—you shouldn’t say this is just an ordinary suit, and all we have to do is follow A, B, and C, and we get there. You’re asking us to do a lot of new stuff, aren’t you?” Olson replied, “We’re asking the court to apply bedrock constitutional law and principles to a wholly new set of facts.” \n\nThe government, for its part, disputed some of those facts. Judge Aiken had found that the plaintiffs had standing to sue because they had demonstrated three things: that they had suffered particular, concrete injuries; that the cause of their injuries was “fairly traceable” to the government’s actions; and that the courts had the ability, at least partially, to remedy these injuries. On the first two parts of standing, the government’s case is weakening by the minute, owing especially to the growing body of attribution science—studies published in peer-reviewed journals that directly link extreme weather events, such as huge hurricanes and raging wildfires, to climate change. “Evidence to meet the standing burden has gotten much stronger,” Ann Carlson, an environmental-law professor at U.C.L.A., told me. \n\nAll the plaintiffs were in the courtroom for the hearing. They have each submitted sworn testimony to the court, explaining the personal injuries that climate change has caused in their lives. The youngest, Levi Draheim, who is now eleven, lives in the barrier-island community of Satellite Beach, Florida, which his family has been forced to evacuate several times, due to hurricanes and floods. Jayden Foytlin, who is fifteen and lives near [the Louisiana coast](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/04/01/louisianas-disappearing-coast), suffered emotional trauma when her home was severely flooded in 2016 and 2017\\. In her testimony, she describes how her family, having nowhere else to go, slept in the living room in a “house that was full of sewage and flood water damage.” Journey Zephier, nineteen, of Hawaii, has watched treasured coral reefs near his home die, due to ocean acidification and warming temperatures, and last year saw his home flood when an unprecedented fifty inches of rain fell in less than twenty-four hours, which also caused landslides and power outages in his community. Jamie Butler, eighteen, had to leave her home and her relatives in the Navajo Nation, because of severe drought and water scarcity. Kelsey Juliana, the lead plaintiff (and the oldest, at twenty-three), grew up in Eugene, Oregon, where she is now an environmental-studies major at the University of Oregon. She, along with eight of the other plaintiffs, described adverse health impacts from the wildfires that rage in and around their home towns practically every year. Some also wrote about the damage that extreme weather events and climate threats have caused to their cultural heritage; others described psychological troubles—nightmares, anxiety, depression.\n\nOlson and the other lawyers can make a strong case that the plaintiffs’ injuries are “fairly traceable” to the government’s actions, considering that, for instance, [almost twenty-five per cent](https://pubs.usgs.gov/sir/2018/5131/sir20185131.pdf) of U.S. carbon-dioxide emissions come from fossil-fuel development on federally owned land. There is also plenty of evidence that the government has known for many decades the dangers that adding greenhouse-gas emissions to the atmosphere would bring. The Ninth Circuit judges seemed more than sympathetic to these arguments—both to the plaintiffs’ injuries and to the fact that they could be linked to the government’s policies. “You present compelling evidence that we have a real problem,” Judge Hurwitz told Olson. “You present compelling evidence that we have inaction by the other two branches of government. It may even rise to the level of criminal neglect.” With statements like that, Carlson told me, “That’s about as sympathetic a panel as the plaintiffs are going to get.”\n\nBut Hurwitz and the two other judges hesitated about the third condition of standing—the ability of the courts to redress the plaintiffs’ injuries—which ultimately goes back to the separation of powers. He said, “The issue here is whether this branch of government, embodied by the three of us today, has the ability to issue the relief that your clients seek.” Olson argued that it did, because the case was not based on the government’s *inaction* (as Hurwitz’s hypothetical had implied) but, rather, on its affirmative and substantial actions to facilitate, subsidize, and promote a fossil-fuel-based energy system. The courts could, therefore, declare that the government must use its statutory authority to transition the economy away from fossil fuels, and order government agencies—such as the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of the Interior, and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration—to create national plans detailing how such a transition could be achieved. The evidence presented at trial—documents, cross-examination testimony, expert witnesses—would provide the specifics that such plans needed to include, Olson said.\n\nThe judges did not seem entirely convinced that the courts had the power to intervene in the activities of so many parts of the executive branch—at least eight government agencies would be involved. “I’m trying to figure out if we have done anything “on this scale, to this proportion,” Judge Murguia said. “I’m almost drawing on a clean slate.” Olson said that “the scale of the problem is so big because of the systemic conduct of the government.” As precedents, she pointed to Supreme Court cases in which the courts were deeply involved in the remedy of constitutional violations. In Brown v. Board of Education, the Court declared that segregation was unconstitutional in public schools, and then, in a follow-up ruling, ordered all federal, state, and local districts to desegregate. In Hills v. Gautreaux, the Court upheld an order requiring the Department of Housing and Urban Development to rectify discriminatory public housing. \n\nIn the government’s view, as Clark presented it, “the sweeping nature of the case” made it “a direct attack on the separation of powers” and “an assault on the Constitution’s design.” But, in the most basic terms, wasn’t the Constitution designed so that one branch of government can check the other two, if their behavior fails to protect and preserve individual liberties? It was, but, as Hurwitz noted, “We may have the wrong Congress and the wrong President. That’s occurred from time to time over history. The real question for us is whether we get to intervene because of that.” That is to say, the judges need to decide whether they agree that the government’s action go beyond politics and are violating the plaintiffs’ constitutional rights—rights that only exist if we have a stable climate.\n\nThe judges will take a few weeks to issue their decision. If they decide in the plaintiffs’ favor, the government will likely petition the Supreme Court, again, to prevent the trial from proceeding. The Justices may decide that they need the full factual record that a trial would provide; they generally want things fully baked. For observers thinking about long-term climate-litigation strategy, though, there is concern that the present bench of Justices might take the opportunity—either after the trial or in refusing to let it go forward—to set a precedent that could be damaging to environmental protections in lawsuits down the road. Worst of all, it might lead them to revisit Massachusetts v. E.P.A., the landmark 2007 decision that established that the E.P.A. has the authority to regulate greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act. Justice Anthony Kennedy was the swing vote on that case; Chief Justice John Roberts wrote a dissenting opinion. “There is real worry,” Michael Gerrard said.\n\nThe strategic question of how far to push environmental cases is one that many groups face. All the challenges to the Trump Administration’s rollbacks of Obama’s climate policies are still pending in lower courts. If an environmental group loses, and takes the case to the Supreme Court, “you might get a decision that is even worse, that has greater reach,” Carlson said. Still, the fact that the Juliana case has come this far has had a galvanizing impact. Thousands of people, across the country and around the world, watched a live stream of the hearing—on the Ninth Circuit’s YouTube channel, on outdoor screens in parks—and the judges commented several times on the widespread interest in the case. It seemed indicative of what’s to come. In Olson’s concluding statement, she put the matter in its appropriate context. “If we look back on the twentieth century, we can see that race and sex discrimination were the constitutional questions of that era. And when our great-grandchildren look back at the twenty-first century, they will see that government-sanctioned climate destruction was the constitutional issue of this century.” ","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c772bfcc72cd92d0520","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Climate Change","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"climate-change"},{"id":"5c2e1c96e56e652c9027468c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Supreme Court","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"supreme-court"},{"id":"5c2e1c7a41e4c73c088d7753","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Youth","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"youth"},{"id":"5c2e1c7d41c92e2c9b85da22","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Trump Administration","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"trump-administration"},{"id":"5c2e1d8a41e4c73c088d788c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Environmental Protection Agency (E.P.A.)","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"environmental-protection-agency-epa"}],"sections":[{"id":"5907f159ebe912338a3717d7","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Daily Comment","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"daily-comment"}]},"channel":"News","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"590c9eaeda97f12ef9160003","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Carolyn Kormann has been a contributor to the *The New Yorker* since 2012, and became a staff writer in 2018, covering energy, the environment, and climate change.

The latest took place on Friday, and drew what is estimated as more than a million participants in a hundred and twenty-five countries. The strikes have been the biggest boost yet for the global climate movement, galvanizing public attention by reminding people just who will have to deal with the mess that older generations have created. Thunberg has spoken to the Pope and to the British and European parliaments—and this week she and her fellow student leaders are speaking to everyone else who’s older than them. On Thursday, they [issued an appeal](https://globalclimatestrike.net/) to adults to take up the same tactic, and on Friday a number of them responded, with a letter pledging to organize the first of a series of all-ages, one-day climate strikes, on Friday, September 20th. (I was among them and helped draft the letter.) The initial list of signees is composed of a wide array of, well, adults, from around the world. Some have spent their lives trying to make change from within the system, such as Christiana Figueres, the United Nations diplomat who served as the lead negotiator of the Paris climate accords. Others are writers (Margaret Atwood, Barbara Kingsolver), scientists (Tim Flannery, of the University of Melbourne; Katharine Hayhoe, of Texas Tech), trade-union leaders (Sharan Burrow, the general secretary of the International Trade Union Confederation), and indigenous leaders from Australia (Anne Poelina) to America (Tom B. K. Goldtooth) and the Arctic (Jenni Laiti). \n\nWhat all of these people have in common is a strong sense that business as usual has become the problem, and that it needs to be interrupted, if only for a day. The climate crisis is a perplexing one because, mostly, we just get up each day and do what we did the day before, as if an enormous emergency weren’t unfolding around us. That hasn’t been true of past crises: during the Second World War, oceans may have separated American civilians from the fighting, but every day they were aware of the need to change their ways of life: to conserve resources, buy bonds, black out their windows at night if they lived on the coast. \n\nThe climate emergency, however, is deceptive. Unless it’s your town that day that’s being hit by wildfire or a flood, it’s easy to let the day’s more pressing news take precedence. It can be hard to remember that climate change underlies so many daily injustices, from the [forced migration of refugees](https://www.unhcr.org/en-us/climate-change-and-disasters.html) to the [spread of disease](https://earth.stanford.edu/news/how-does-climate-change-affect-disease#gs.dejxjp). Indeed, the people who suffer the most are usually those on the periphery—the iron law of climate change is that the less you did to cause it the more you suffer from it. So we focus on the latest Presidential tweet or trade war instead of on the latest incremental rise in carbon dioxide, even though that, in the end, is the far more critical news. \n\nA one-day work stoppage—a decision to spend a day demanding action from governments or building a bike path—is a way to break out of that bad habit. It gives people a chance to do the hard but necessary work of talking about an issue of paramount importance with their co-workers and bosses. And here’s my prediction: if you do, you’ll be surprised how many of those co-workers and bosses are grateful for the chance to do something. The trouble with global warming is not that people don’t care—indeed, polling shows that people care a great deal. But the crisis seems so big, and we seem so small, that it’s hard to imagine that we can make a difference. \n\nIn previous social movements, other institutions have been key: the African-American church, for instance, was the heart and soul of the civil-rights movement. But we live in an age when work defines our lives, so work is a crucial place to organize. In the past few weeks, employees at Amazon have brought together thousands of their co-workers to [demand](https://www.geekwire.com/2019/7600-amazon-employees-demand-action-climate-change-advance-annual-meeting/ ) that the company reduce its carbon footprint. That kind of organizing is daunting, because it means confronting the boss. A one-day climate strike may be easier—you just have to tell your boss that you’ll be elsewhere that day. Or you could ask her to go along, too. \n\nObviously, it’s not that simple for everyone: some bosses would fire you; too many people can’t live without a day’s wages; and firefighters can’t very well take a day off. That just increases the urgency for people who *can* act. The strikes may take a while to catch on, just as the school students’ strikes did. But, if the momentum builds, there’s a chance that we can shift the Zeitgeist toward the quick and transformative kind of action that science demands. We need to try. There’s something fundamentally undignified about leaving our troubles to school kids to resolve. It’s time for the elders to act like elders.","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c772bfcc72cd92d0520","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Climate Change","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"climate-change"},{"id":"5c2e1cbc36cecf4019214252","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Global Warming","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"global-warming"},{"id":"5c2e1c7a397f5b30646d05ec","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Environmentalism","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"environmentalism"}],"sections":[{"id":"5907f159ebe912338a3717d7","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Daily Comment","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"daily-comment"}]},"channel":"News","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"5910a78b6c4c222f03a82e0e","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"","canonicalUrl":"http://www.newyorker.com/contributors/bill-mckibben","email":"","name":"Bill McKibben","socialMedia":[],"title":"Bill McKibben, a former New Yorker staff writer, is a founder of the grassroots climate campaign 350.org and the Schumann Distinguished Scholar in environmental studies at Middlebury College.

For decades, Iran has been expanding its regional influence by funding, training, and arming proxy forces in unstable countries, and then helping them develop into political movements that are opposed to U.S. interests. For just as long, U.S. officials have called this strategy “sponsoring terrorism.” But, in the past year, the [Trump Administration](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/trump-administration) and the mullahs in Tehran have goaded each other into a series of pointless escalations, treating war as a game of chicken that is now hurtling out of control.\n\nThirteen months ago, the United States [pulled out of its own nuclear deal](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/trump-destroys-the-iran-dealand-a-lot-more) with Iran, not because the Iranians had violated it—there is no evidence to suggest that they had—but seemingly because it had been negotiated by [President Trump’s](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/donald-trump) predecessor. In April, the U.S. [designated](https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/trumps-strange-tense-campaign-against-iran) Iran’s Revolutionary Guard, a powerful military and intelligence faction that has roughly a hundred and twenty-five thousand troops, a “terrorist organization”; in response, Iran passed a law that designates every American soldier in the Middle East as a “terrorist.” On June 7th, Trump’s special envoy to Iran mocked the Iranian Air Force, saying that it has “Photoshopped antiquated aircraft and tried to pass them off as new stealth fighter jets.” Days later, the Revolutionary Guard shot down a hundred-and-thirty-million-dollar U.S. surveillance drone, “in large part to prove they could do it,” the *Times* reported. Both governments practically celebrated the incident as a reason to ratchet up tensions.\n\nOn June 20th, Trump ordered a military strike, only to withdraw the order with ten minutes to spare, partly owing to a crisis of conscience—apparently the bombardment would have killed around a hundred and fifty people—and partly, according to the *Times*, because the Fox News host Tucker Carlson had told Trump that another casualty of the strike would be his hope of [being reëlected](https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/what-are-the-chances-of-trump-being-reelected).\n\nNow the Iranians have abandoned the nuclear deal, following a year of compliance with the remaining five partners; the Revolutionary Guard is gaining power and recklessly lashing out, giving the United States more reasons to respond with a deadly strike. On June 25th, in response to Iran’s President, Hassan Rouhani, saying that the White House was “afflicted by mental retardation,” Trump threatened the “[obliteration](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/25/world/middleeast/iran-rouhani-us-sanctions.html)” of Iran. After which, who knows?\n\nBeneath the bluster, senior officials in the Trump Administration have been pushing forward a legal pretext to go to war with Iran: that the government is harboring members of Al Qaeda. This argument relies on a one-sentence law, the [Authorization for Use of Military Force](https://www.congress.gov/107/plaws/publ40/PLAW-107publ40.pdf), passed three days after 9/11, which empowers the President “to use all necessary and appropriate force against those nations, organizations, or persons he determines planned, authorized, committed, or aided” in the commission of 9/11\\. It was passed by Congress with near-total unanimity, and yet, since then, it has come to reflect the legislative branch’s abdication of its role in the separation of war powers.\n\nIn public, Trump Administration officials have deflected questions about whether the President intends to invoke this authorization for Iran. Mike Pompeo, the Secretary of State, has said that he’d “prefer to just leave that to lawyers.” But the law has already been used as cover for at least thirty-seven military operations in fourteen countries. “There is no doubt there is a connection” between Al Qaeda and Iran, Pompeo continued. “Period. Full stop.”\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\n\nThe day after 9/11, the White House sent a draft proposal of the law to the leaders of the Senate and the House, requesting that they authorize the President “to deter and pre-empt any future acts of terrorism or aggression against the United States.” Congress rejected that language, limiting the authorization specifically to those who were responsible for the attack. Lamar Smith, a conservative Texas representative, insisted on registering an objection before voting in favor of the bill. “It does not go far enough,” Smith [complained](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CREC-2001-09-14/html/CREC-2001-09-14-pt1-PgH5638-4.htm). He lamented that the A.U.M.F. “ties the President’s hands and allows only the pursuit of one individual and his followers and supporters.” Smith needn’t have worried. In the years that followed, the war on terror took on an absurd, escalatory logic: as terrorist groups proliferated, Presidential lawyers simply decided, with no meaningful oversight, that the A.U.M.F. permitted the executive branch to send troops to places that had no relevance to Osama bin Laden and other 9/11 plotters. (The lone dissenting vote against the A.U.M.F. was cast by Representative Barbara Lee, a Democrat from California, who warned her colleagues in Congress “not to embark on an open-ended war with neither an exit strategy nor a focused target.” In response, she was called a “traitor,” a “coward,” and a “communist,” and received thousands of angry calls and e-mails, including death threats.)\n\nEighteen years later, it’s hard to conceive of a metric by which the United States’ response to 9/11 has been a success. The military has become much better at killing insurgents, but only because the war on terror, with all of its excesses and mistakes, has created so many of them. The Taliban currently controls more of Afghanistan than it has since the earliest months of the invasion. Al Qaeda has expanded from a group that had a few hundred adherents, mostly based in southern Afghanistan, into a global terror franchise, with branches in West Africa, East Africa, the Arabian Peninsula, Central Asia, the Sinai Peninsula, South Asia, and the Levant. The A.U.M.F. is also the basis for the U.S.’s prolonged campaign against the Islamic State, a group that didn’t exist when bin Laden attacked the United States, and which has been battling Al Qaeda for more than five years. Now American soldiers whose parents deployed after 9/11 are being sent to countries thousands of miles from Afghanistan, to kill jihadis unaffiliated with Al Qaeda and who were born after the attacks. “The biggest casualty in the struggle against the Islamic State so far has been the American Constitution,” Bruce Ackerman, a professor at Yale Law School, wrote, in 2015.\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\n\nOn September 12, 2017, an American citizen walked out of *ISIS*{: .small} territory and into the hands of the Syrian Democratic Forces, America’s proxy force in northeastern Syria. The S.D.F. turned him over to the Americans, who brought him to a detention facility in Iraq and began questioning him, without giving him access to a lawyer. After his detention leaked to the press, the American Civil Liberties Union filed a writ of habeas corpus on his behalf, and later argued that the government could not indefinitely detain him as an enemy combatant, because the war against *ISIS*{: .small} had not been authorized by Congress. The American was eventually deported to Bahrain, but not before government lawyers were forced to enter into evidence their argument that the A.U.M.F. applies to *ISIS*{: .small}.\n\nThey wrote, correctly, that *ISIS*{: .small} “began as a terrorist group founded and led by Abu Mu’sab al-Zarqawi,” a Jordanian street thug. Then came the misleading part: “Al-Zarqawi was an associate of Osama bin Laden, the leader of the al-Qaida terrorist group, dating back to al-Zarqawi’s time in Afghanistan and Pakistan before al-Qaida attacked the United States on September 11, 2001.” This characterization echoed a speech that Colin Powell, then the Secretary of State, gave on February 5, 2003, to the United Nations Security Council, in the run-up to the Iraq War. “Iraq today harbors a deadly terrorist network headed by Abu Mu’sab al-Zarqawi, an associate and collaborator of Osama bin Laden and his Al Qaeda lieutenants,” Powell said. Behind him, a PowerPoint [slide](https://2001-2009.state.gov/secretary/former/powell/photos/2003/17361.htm) depicted Zarqawi as the head of an international terror cell, spanning Europe, Asia, and the Middle East. A few days later, George W. Bush described Zarqawi as “a senior Al Qaeda terrorist planner.” Then Condoleezza Rice, Bush’s national-security adviser, went on television and announced that “a poisons master named Zarqawi” was “the strongest link of Saddam Hussein to Al Qaeda.” Ten days later, the U.S. began bombing Baghdad.\n\nIn fact, when Zarqawi travelled to Afghanistan, in 1999, bin Laden snubbed him. The Al Qaeda leader considered himself an intellectual; he and his deputies had no interest in recruiting Zarqawi, a high-school dropout with a history of alcoholism and of raping both women and men. Al Qaeda operatives also worried that Zarqawi’s network might have been infiltrated by Jordanian intelligence. Zarqawi, for his part, had no interest in pledging allegiance to bin Laden, which was a formal condition of Al Qaeda membership. \n\nFor two weeks, Zarqawi stayed in a safe house in Kandahar, before he was finally visited by Saif al-Adel, a former Egyptian Army officer who coördinated Al Qaeda’s military operations. “I had reservations” about him, Adel later wrote, in a letter to a Jordanian journalist. “Abu Mu’sab was a hardliner,” who was “not really very good at words.” But Adel figured that Zarqawi might be a useful asset in recruiting other Jordanians, and so he gave him five thousand dollars and sent him to an empty training camp near Herat, more than three hundred and fifty miles away. There, Zarqawi established his own jihadi group, with around a dozen followers. Even from a distance, the Al Qaeda leadership found his behavior disturbing; in Herat, Zarqawi married a thirteen-year-old girl.\n\n“We knew he wasn’t part of al Qaida and didn’t seem to coordinate operations with them,” Nada Bakos, a former C.I.A. analyst who was Zarqawi’s lead targeter, wrote in her memoir, “[The Targeter: My Life in the CIA, Hunting Terrorists and Challenging the White House](https://www.amazon.com/Targeter-Life-Hunt-Godfather-ISIS/dp/0316260479),” which was published earlier this month. “The CIA had determined that Zarqawi’s organization didn’t know about the 9/11 attacks, much less participate in them.” Yet, Bakos writes, “everyone within the Iraq unit sweated under the demands from George W. Bush and his administration for more answers about a possible Iraq–al Qaida collaboration than we could plausibly provide.” She and her colleagues watched Powell’s speech to the U.N. in disbelief. As they pushed back, the Administration reframed its requests for evidence of a connection, asking them to prove a negative: that Zarqawi wasn’t part of Al Qaeda, and that he wasn’t working with Saddam. In searching for a pretext to invade Iraq, the United States had given Zarqawi what bin Laden had refused him: relevance.\n\nYet, after the fall of Iraq and the rise of the insurgency, Al Qaeda found a way to capitalize on the sudden credibility of Zarqawi’s group. In July, 2004, the United States increased the bounty on Zarqawi to twenty-five million dollars—the same as that on bin Laden. Six months later, bin Laden bestowed upon Zarqawi the title of Al Qaeda in Iraq. In “[Black Flags: The Rise of ISIS](https://www.amazon.com/Black-Flags-Rise-Joby-Warrick/dp/0804168938),” Joby Warrick writes, “By co-opting Zarqawi, al-Qaeda could share the credit for his successes and draw in new energy from his suddenly white-hot celebrity.”\n\n“Branding is not the same thing as operational control,” Bakos told me, earlier this week. “That was the distinction we made with Zarqawi. He was never part of Al Qaeda prior to the Iraq invasion. He made up his own agenda.” \n\nMeanwhile, as part of its argument that the A.U.M.F. applied to *ISIS*{: .small}, the U.S. government has weighed in on an ongoing spat between *ISIS*{: .small} and Al Qaeda. Last February, Trump Administration lawyers entered into evidence a claim by *ISIS*{: .small} “that it is the true executor of bin Laden’s legacy, rather than al-Qa’ida’s current leadership.”\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\n\nThe story of the American Presidency after 9/11 is that of a power grab, facilitated by Congress’s abdication of responsibility and the judiciary’s reticence to challenge the executive branch on matters of national security. Lawyers from the Office of Legal Counsel draft secret authorizations that, left unchallenged, become precedent for other secret authorizations, so that, at a certain point, to undo one authorization might bring down an entire house of cards. “When OLC writes its legal opinions supporting broad presidential authority in these contexts—as OLCs of both parties have consistently done—they cite executive branch precedents (including Attorney General and OLC opinions) as often as court opinions,” Jack Goldsmith, who served for nine months as the Assistant Attorney General in Bush’s Office of Legal Counsel, wrote in his memoir, “[The Terror Presidency: Law and Judgment Inside the Bush Administration](https://www.amazon.com/Terror-Presidency-Judgment-Inside-Administration/dp/039333533X).” He continued, “These executive branch precedents are ‘law’ for the executive branch even though they are never scrutinized or approved by courts.”\n\nIt is true that there is, as Pompeo put it, “a connection” between Iran and Al Qaeda. It has been true since at least 2002, when a group of bin Laden’s deputies, who were fleeing Afghanistan, guessed that Iran would see a greater strategic value in keeping them and their families under house arrest than in turning them over to the United States. Earlier this year, I met Al Qaeda’s lead negotiator in this arrangement, a Mauritanian ideologue named Abu Hafs al-Mauritani. (He had previously served as Osama bin Laden’s adviser on Sharia law, and, though he opposed 9/11, he knew about it before it took place.) Partly as prisoners, partly as guests, Abu Hafs explained, the Al Qaeda families underwent routine interrogations, but they were allowed to have phones and Internet access, and were chaperoned by Iranian intelligence officers on visits to luxurious malls and gyms. It was under these circumstances that Abu Hafs raised one of bin Laden’s sons, Hamza, who is now thirty years old and ascending in the Al Qaeda ranks. For the Iranians, it was about leverage: while bin Laden’s family and lieutenants lived at the mercy of its Revolutionary Guard, there would be no Al Qaeda operations in Iran. \n\nAbu Hafs left Iran in 2012, but, according to a recent report by the United Nations, two high-level Al Qaeda operatives continue to live there. The Bush and Obama Administrations both knew of Al Qaeda’s arrangement with the Iranians; neither saw fit to attack, even as both took advantage of the broad language of the 2001 A.U.M.F. in other areas of the world. Similarly, the Trump Administration doesn’t claim that the Al Qaeda presence in Iran is a threat to the United States. The war, if there is one, will be for other reasons; Al Qaeda is merely the key to unlocking the A.U.M.F.—to have soldiers kill, and be killed, without congressional approval. \n\nDuring Goldsmith’s nine months in Bush’s Office of Legal Counsel, he drafted three resignation letters. After he revoked several secret O.L.C. opinions, including one that authorized the C.I.A. to torture detainees, he submitted one. “The danger, of course, is that OLC lives inside the very political executive branch, is subject to few real rules to guide its actions, and has little or no oversight or public accountability,” he wrote. In other words, he continued, Presidents define their policies and then lawyers find some way to make them legal. And the integrity of the office lies in its “cultural norms.”\n\nThe cultural norms of the Presidency are currently determined by a man who, on the afternoon of September 11, 2001, was asked on live television whether a building he owned on Wall Street had suffered any damage during the attack. “Well, it was an amazing phone call,” he said, as footage of the falling towers played onscreen. “Forty Wall Street actually was the second-tallest building in downtown Manhattan.” (It wasn’t.) “And now it’s the tallest.” He went on to suggest that a Boeing 767 couldn't “possibly go through the steel” beams without secondary explosions—a line of questioning at the core of the 9/11-truther movement. Then he became the President of the United States.\n\n*A previous version of this piece misstated the location of the Office of Legal

In his role as the deputy commander of the detention camp’s Criminal Investigation Task Force, Fallon had spent the previous months trying to prevent the military from adopting abusive interrogation practices. But he was being ignored by the commander of detention operations, and was often kept out of key meetings. Now, when Fallon heard that that top lawyers for the George W. Bush Administration and the C.I.A. were planning to visit Guantánamo, “it set off screaming threat-warning alarms,” he writes in his memoir, “[Unjustifiable Means](https://www.amazon.com/Unjustifiable-Means-Pentagon-Government-Conspired/dp/1942872798),” which was heavily redacted before being published, in 2017\\. Fallon, who is an experienced interrogator, suspected that these lawyers would provide legal cover for an array of torture techniques, including waterboarding, and he wanted to explain to them that these practices were originally designed by Communist forces during the Korean War to elicit false confessions for propaganda purposes. Barely a year after 9/11, Fallon recalls, he was already “developing a new rule of thumb for the war on terror: where lawyers go, bad things follow.”\n\nThe next day, when the delegation arrived, Fallon tried to accompany the lawyers on a tour of the facilities. But he wasn’t allowed on the bus; one of the commander’s assistants instructed him to return to his office and wait for them to come by after the tour. Ninety minutes later, when Fallon checked in with the commander’s office, he learned that the lawyers were already on their way back to Washington, D.C. “I was incredulous,” he writes. Unable to confront the lawyers in person, he and others in his unit sought to document everything and to challenge the military through official channels. \n\n+++inset-right \n\n[#externallink: /externallinks/5cbb6d1ceacf5a2e322710e4]|||||| \n\n+++\n\nOn October 2nd, Fallon sent a member of his legal team to take notes during a meeting in which a senior C.I.A. lawyer apparently briefed military lawyers and psychologists on torture techniques and loopholes in international law. Later that month, when Fallon received the meeting minutes, he forwarded them in an e-mail to his unit’s chief legal counsel, noting that the discussion “looks like the kinds of stuff Congressional hearings are made of,” and would “shock the conscience of any legal body.” He added, “Someone needs to be considering how history will look back at this.”\n\nIt is due to the efforts of women and men like Fallon, who documented secret shifts in American policy from inside the government, that history has been able to look back at the workings of the war on terror at all. Last summer, when I began working on a profile of the unlikely friendship between Mohamedou Salahi, a former Guantánamo detainee, and Steve Wood, one of his guards, which was [published in this week’s magazine](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/04/22/guantanamos-darkest-secret), I pored through dozens of testimonies and books by investigators, interrogators, C.I.A. officers, military-police and intelligence officers, government lawyers, and psychologists—and the published results of government inquiries, such as the 2008 Senate Armed Services Committee [report on the treatment of detainees in U.S. custody](https://www.armed-services.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Detainee-Report-Final_April-22-2009.pdf). But no less useful were the accounts of the men and women who ended up under scrutiny for their practices and behavior—people who, after 9/11, operated within moral and legal gray areas, like James Mitchell, the C.I.A. contract psychologist who devised the agency’s enhanced-interrogation program. In his memoir, “[Enhanced Interrogation](https://www.amazon.com/Enhanced-Interrogation-Motives-Islamic-Terrorists/dp/1101906847),” Mitchell makes a compelling case that, in a small number of extremely abusive interrogations—overseen by doctors, lawyers, and Mitchell himself—he achieved what he describes as “Pavlovian conditioning” in humans. In seeking to rebut the pervading narrative—from press accounts and a [2014 Senate inquiry](https://www.intelligence.senate.gov/sites/default/files/publications/CRPT-113srpt288.pdf)—that his program was equally feckless and evil, Mitchell defends it mainly against the former accusation, and inadvertently reveals a methodology that fits the U.S. government’s own definition of nonconsensual “human subjects research,” the official term for human experimentation. The year after Mitchell published his memoir, it was cited in a lengthy [report by Physicians for Human Rights](https://phr.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/phr_humanexperimentation_report.pdf), which argues that the interrogation program represented “one of the gravest breaches of medical ethics” since the Nazi medical experiments during the Second World War.\n\nThese documents—along with contemporaneous reports and books by investigative journalists, academics, lawyers, and human-rights advocates—make up an evolving draft of post-9/11 history. With each passing year, more details surface in memoirs, lawsuits, and military commissions, and the historical record comes into sharper focus. Millions of pages have come to light, and millions more remain classified. But, seventeen years into the war on terror, a core, uncomfortable fact remains: people on the receiving end of classified security programs—from drone strikes to renditions and interrogations—become aware of the outlines of secret U.S. national-security laws and practices long before American citizens have any clarity or say about what is being done in their name.\n\nEfforts to shine light on government misconduct are not only a matter of moral reckoning, or of learning from past mistakes; they are necessary to puncture conspiratorial narratives that circulate in parts of the world that our government hardly understands, and which hardly understand the West. In recent years, working in the Middle East and Africa, I have routinely come into contact with people who cite the U.S.’s incredible resources as evidence that every action taken by our government must be deliberate—that even its greatest blunders are, in fact, leading toward some secretly desired outcome. (A common example is that, because *ISIS*{: .small} held so much territory for so long, it must have somehow served U.S. interests.) The only antidote is truth, however ugly or embarrassing. And out of the existence of so vast a public record comes the hope that those who have grown up during the war on terror will revisit how we got here. \n\nTo that end, below is a list of books and reports that informed my piece.

He and his comrades were told that many of the detainees were responsible for 9/11 and, given the opportunity, would strike again. “I just remember being super excited, because I thought, I’m going to be doing something important,” Wood told me. For two weeks, he worked as a guard in the cellblocks, monitoring men who had been captured on the battlefields of Afghanistan. Then a sergeant major pulled him aside for a brief interview, and assigned him to work the night shift in Echo Special, a secret, single-occupancy unit that had been built to house the United States military’s highest-value detainee. The International Committee of the Red Cross—which has access to many of the world’s most notorious detention sites, some of them in countries where there is no rule of law—had recently sent representatives to Guantánamo, but the base commander, citing “military necessity,” had refused to allow them into Echo Special. The man confined there was referred to by his detainee number, 760\\. When Wood tried to search for 760 in Guantánamo’s detainee database, he found nothing.\n\nWood was the second of three boys. His father died in a plane crash when he was three years old, and his mother brought him and his brothers up in Molalla, Oregon, a lumber town about an hour south of Portland. His mother dated a string of alcoholics and addicts, and took the children to an evangelical church on Sundays; Pat Robertson’s sermons blasted from the living-room TV. In 1999, shortly after graduating from high school, Wood started a job at the local sawmill. Several of his co-workers were missing fingers, and the manager took every opportunity to denigrate the staff. After a few months, he signed up for the Oregon National Guard, on the military-police track. He sought structure and discipline—a life of pride, purpose, and clarity of mission.\n\nAfter 9/11, patriotism eclipsed restlessness as Wood’s primary motivation to serve. He had spent the morning of the worst terrorist attack in American history lying on his mother’s couch, high on painkillers after a tonsillectomy, but when he emerged from the haze he was angry, focussed, and longing for deployment. He didn’t harbor any particular animosity toward Muslims, but he had absorbed his mother’s belief: “If it’s not from Jesus then it must be from the Devil.” After completing the requirements to become an M.P., Wood enrolled in a criminal-justice program at a nearby community college. He recalled his political views as being “whatever Fox News told us.” He didn’t know the difference between a Hindu, a Sikh, and a Muslim—he had never met one.\n\nBefore his first shift in Echo Special, Wood was told to place a strip of electrical tape over the name on his uniform, and to use only nicknames inside the cell, so that if 760 were to somehow sneak a message out of the camp he couldn’t issue fatwas against his guards or their families. “Never turn your back,” the sergeant major warned him. Wood, who was twenty-three, had recently learned that his girlfriend was pregnant. He wouldn’t take any chances. “You trust the handcuffs and everything, but, no matter what, we’d never be with him one on one—there would always be a partner,” Wood told me. Until recently, the guards and the interrogators had worn Halloween masks inside the cell. Wood walked through the camp to Echo Special proud to be part of a serious national-security operation. He thought, It must be somebody really important—the most dangerous person in the world, perhaps—to have this special attention, a guard force just for him.\n\nEcho Special was a trailer that had been divided in two. Wood walked into the main area, which housed the guards; through a door was the prisoner’s sleeping space. A government report describes the facility as having been “modified in such a way as to reduce as much outside stimuli as possible,” with doors that had been “sealed to a point that allows no light to enter the room.” Inside, the walls were “covered with white paint or paper to further eliminate objects the detainee may concentrate on.” There was an eyebolt for shackling him to the floor, and speakers for bombarding him with sound.\n\nAn M.P. explained to Wood that the current guard force called Detainee 760 “Pillow,” because when they had arrived, several months earlier, a pillow was the only object in his possession. Then one of them shouted, “Pillow, you can come out now!” A short man in his mid-thirties stepped into the guards’ area, unshackled. He wore a broad smile and a white jumpsuit, and moved cautiously toward Wood. The detainee introduced himself as Mohamedou Salahi, then reached for a handshake, and said, “What’s up, dude?”\n\nWood is six feet three, with a shaved head, a shy, stoic manner, and the musculature of an élite bodybuilder. Although he towered over Salahi, he hesitated before taking his hand, and when he did he noted how delicate Salahi was. “Nice to meet you,” Wood said. But he thought, What the fuck is this? This is the exact opposite of what’s supposed to happen.\n\n-=-=-=\n\nThe fragmented image of Mohamedou Salahi that United States military, law-enforcement, and intelligence agencies assembled in a classified dossier was that of a “highly intelligent” Mauritanian electrical engineer, who, “as a key al-Qaida member,” had played a role in several mass-casualty plots. Other men carried box cutters and explosives; Salahi was a ghost on the periphery. The evidence against him lacked depth, but investigators considered its breadth conclusive. His proximity to so many events and high-level jihadi figures could not be explained by coincidence, they thought, and only a logistical mastermind could have left so faint a trail.\n\nThe U.S. government gathered that in 1991, when Salahi was twenty, he swore allegiance to Osama bin Laden, and the following year he learned to handle weapons at an Al Qaeda training camp in Afghanistan. Later, Salahi moved to Germany, where, the Americans assessed, “his primary responsibility was to recruit for al-Qaida in Europe.” Among his alleged recruits were three of the 9/11 hijackers, all of whom served as pilots on separate planes. A fourth was Ramzi bin al-Shibh, the attack coördinator; while in C.I.A. custody, bin al-Shibh named Salahi as the man who had arranged his travel to Afghanistan and his introduction to bin Laden.\n\n+++inset-left\n[#cartoon: /cartoon/5cb10c4f92dcf02ddc860e1e]||||||\n+++\n\nIn 1998, shortly after Al Qaeda detonated truck bombs outside the U.S. Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, Salahi took a call from a phone number belonging to bin Laden. Then, and on at least one other occasion, a member of Al Qaeda’s Shura Council—its leadership—wired some four thousand dollars to Salahi’s bank account in Germany; Salahi withdrew the cash and handed it to men who were travelling to West Africa, to facilitate what the Americans assessed to be money-laundering and telecommunications “projects for al-Qaida.”\n\nIn 1999, the Shura member called Salahi, but U.S. intelligence didn’t know what his instructions were. In November of that year, Salahi moved to Montreal, where he began leading prayers at a prominent mosque. Soon afterward, a jihadi who had attended the same mosque—and who the Americans believed had met Salahi—attempted to smuggle explosives in the trunk of a car across the U.S. border; his plan was to detonate suitcases inside Los Angeles International Airport, in what became known as the Millennium Plot. Canada’s Security Intelligence Service began a surveillance operation focussing on Salahi and his associates, but Salahi noticed two pinhole cameras poking through his apartment walls and left the country. The U.S. government concluded that he was “the leader of the Montreal-based al-Qaida cell.”\n\nIn Guantánamo, Salahi admitted to this and other allegations. “I came to Canada with a plan to blow up the CN Tower in Toronto,” Salahi wrote, in one of his many confessions. He listed his accomplices and added, “thanks to Canadian Intel, the plan was discovered and sentenced to failure.” After years of holding out in interrogations, he had become what the classified dossier described as a “highly cooperative” font of intelligence—“one of the most valuable sources in detention.” He described Al Qaeda’s financial involvement in credit-card fraud and drug smuggling, and also the group’s “investment in unwitting companies in Bosnia, Canada, Chechnya, Denmark, England, Germany, Mauritania, and Spain.” He drew organizational charts, with the names and operational roles of key figures, and supplied intelligence on jihadi cells and safe houses all over Europe and West Africa. Owing to his expertise as an electrical engineer, the dossier concludes, Salahi was also able to describe Al Qaeda’s elaborate communications systems, “including radio relay, couriers, encryption, phone boutiques, and satellite communication links to laptops.” But the U.S. government was sure there was more to be gleaned from him; the dossier says that he “still has useful information” on a variety of subjects, including the 9/11 attacks, and lists twenty-two additional “areas of potential exploitation.” Military officials considered him “the poster child for the intelligence effort at Guantánamo.”\n\n-=-=-=\n\nAs a result of Salahi’s coöperation, his private cell was now stocked with what the government referred to as “comfort items.” After the pillow came soap, towels, a prayer cap, and prayer beads—by the time Steve Wood arrived, Salahi also had books, a television, a PlayStation, and an old laptop, on which he killed time playing chess and watching DVDs. Eventually, Salahi would be allowed access to a small patch of soil outside his trailer, where he tended sunflowers, basil, sage, parsley, and cilantro. “What I was told was that his information had saved thousands of American lives,” Wood said, “and this is what they’d given him to keep talking.”\n\nSalahi was taken into custody when he was thirty years old, but he had already lived on four continents, and spoke fluent Arabic, French, and German. English was his fourth language. Since he had learned it in captivity, some of his earliest phrases were “I ain’t done nothing,” “cavity search,” “fuck this,” and “fuck that.” “My problem is that I had been picking the language from the ‘wrong’ people—namely, U.S. Forces recruits who speak grammatically incorrectly,” he wrote on a scrap of paper inside his cell. “English accepts more curses than any other language, and I soon learned to curse with the commoners.”\n\nAs a matter of professionalism, Wood resolved from the outset to bury in the back of his mind what he had heard of Salahi’s past. “It’s hard to sit there and laugh and chat with the guy, if he’s actually that bad,” Wood told me. The night shift was twelve hours, and he never saw Salahi shackled or restrained. Other Guantánamo prisoners threw punches and feces and urine, but, according to the classified dossier, Salahi’s only disciplinary infraction was that, on May 11, 2003, he “possessed an excessive amount of MRE food.”\n\nSalahi often appeared sullen and withdrawn. But, when he wanted to engage, he spoke with a worldly, provocative humor that Wood found appealing. He liked to rile his guards into debating equality, race, and religion, and he wielded a sophisticated understanding of history and geopolitics to chip away at their beliefs. Before meeting Salahi, Wood had never heard of Mauritania; Salahi told him that, to his great embarrassment, slavery was still practiced there, even among people close to him. Salahi also pushed him to research Western foreign-policy blunders—for example, that in 1953 the American and the British intelligence services had orchestrated a coup in Iran, overthrowing a popular Prime Minister in order to prop up a tyrannical, pro-Western Shah. “Have you heard of Nelson Mandela?” Wood recalled Salahi saying. “Look him up, dude. Look up the prison on Robben Island. See if you think his captivity was just. See what it did to his family.”\n\nA job posting depicts life as an intelligence officer in Guantánamo Bay as “a rewarding challenge with incredible surroundings”—sunsets, beaches, iguanas, pristine Caribbean blue. “After a hustled day of tackling a myriad of issues and directly contributing to the global war on terrorism,” it reads, “fun awaits.” Officers could partake in pottery classes, paintball, rugby, tennis, and softball, or exercise in several pools and gyms. The local dive shop offered gear and certifications for sailing, water-skiing, snorkelling, scuba diving, and more: “No experience, no problem. . . . Relaxing is easy.”\n\nIn practice, many military-police officers killed time by watching movies and getting drunk at the Tiki Bar; they also took flights to Afghanistan, to pick up more detainees. But Wood spent his days in the base library, researching topics that Salahi had brought up in the cell. He devoured volumes on history, foreign affairs, politics, civil rights—“pretty much any type of book you could think of, other than, like, romance novels,” he said. “I was educating myself on the world.” But, because Salahi’s trailer was a national secret, Wood kept a cordial distance from most of the other guards. “I’d come home and iron my uniform, and my roommates didn’t know a thing,” he said. “They’d ask me, ‘Who’s in there?,’ and I’d say, ‘I don’t know, probably somebody famous.’ ”\n\nIn time, Wood began to think of everything he had known before meeting Salahi as a narrow-minded myth of American superiority, notable for its omissions of overseas misadventures. Meanwhile, the Bush Administration’s pretext for invading Iraq was collapsing, and so was Wood’s trust in government. It was the spring of 2004\\. There were no weapons of mass destruction. The “mission” had not been “accomplished.” When Wood watched the evening news, he saw photographs of American M.P.s torturing and sexually humiliating Iraqi detainees at Abu Ghraib. He began to wonder whether the case against Mohamedou Salahi was as flimsy and politically motivated as that for the invasion had been. “I was, like, What else have they lied about?” he said.\n\nSalahi underwent daily interrogations. The sessions Wood witnessed were calm and courteous, with Salahi attempting to answer everything asked of him. “It was the pretty blond interrogator bringing in these disks with footage from Al Qaeda and Taliban training camps in Afghanistan,” Wood recalled. The videos had been pulled from jihadi Web sites, or captured by intelligence officers during raids, and Salahi’s role was to identify the people in them. But sometimes, after coöperating, “he’d get depressed and anxious, and say, ‘I’m a bad Muslim,’ ” Wood told me. “And I’d say, ‘No matter what you did in the past, man, you’ve saved thousands of lives.’ I’d always say that, and he’d just shake his head, like, ‘Bullshit.’ ”\n\nOne night, when Salahi was asleep, Wood heard sounds that reminded him of a child having a nightmare. He walked into the sleeping area and found Salahi lying in the fetal position, shaking. No adult in Wood’s life had ever looked so frightened and so vulnerable. He gently held Salahi’s shoulder, and said, “Everything’s O.K.” Salahi shook his head, and clicked his tongue in disagreement, but refused to speak. The next day, Wood pressed him to talk about the episode, but Salahi wouldn’t elaborate. He just said, “Dude, they fucked me up.”\n\nThe night terrors kept coming. Salahi was on a diet of Ensure nutrition shakes and antidepressants. One day, he complained to Wood that the interrogators were demanding information on events that he couldn’t possibly know about, because they had taken place while he was in custody.\n\nAlthough Wood had introduced himself to Salahi as Stretch, his nickname from the sawmill, Salahi had quickly learned his real name, as well as those of the other guards. “The tape would fall off our uniforms,” Wood recalled. “We’d try to cover it back up, real quick, but eventually we were, like, fuck it. We knew he wasn’t a threat.” Where once he had struggled to forgive himself for enjoying Salahi’s company, he now felt bad about having to lock the door at the end of each shift. He walked into the morning sunlight in a daze, unable to reconcile his impression of the man in Echo Special with the depiction of the terrorist in the dossier. Had Wood remained as a regular guard, in one of the regular cellblocks, he might have finished his deployment with his understanding of the global war on terror more or less intact. Instead, he began to wonder whether what he was actually protecting at Guantánamo was one of the government’s darkest secrets: that its highest-value military detainee was being held essentially by mistake, and that his isolation in Echo Special was intended to cover up the hell that had been inflicted upon him.\n\nOne day, Salahi started requesting paper from his guards. As the result of a recent court ruling, Guantánamo detainees had access to legal representation, and so, during the next several months, Salahi drafted a diary of his detention as a series of harrowing letters to his lawyers, Nancy Hollander, Sylvia Royce, and Theresa Duncan—four hundred and sixty-six pages, sealed in envelopes and mailed to a classified facility near Washington, D.C. No guards or interrogators were allowed to read Salahi’s work. For the first time, he described his experiences without fear of retribution. On one page, he recalled the day he got his nickname, when an interrogator brought him a pillow. “I received the present with a fake overwhelming happiness, and not because I was dying to get a pillow,” he wrote. “No. I took the pillow as a sign of the end of the physical torture.”\n\n## The Detainee\n\n-=-=-=\n\nMohamedou Ould Salahi was born in late December, 1970, the ninth child of a Mauritanian camel herder and his wife. Like most countries in West Africa, Mauritania had gained independence from France a decade earlier. Few locals spoke French, but since the country had been arbitrarily drawn up as a vast, mostly desert territory, populated by numerous ethnic groups who spoke different languages, there was no alternative for official documentation. When a nurse, who spoke only Hassaniya Arabic, filled out Mohamedou’s birth certificate in the Latin alphabet, she omitted a syllable from his last name. Salahi became “Slahi.” So began a life in which governments treated Salahi in accordance with their own mistakes.\n\nSalahi was a precocious student; after school, he used to steal chalk from the classroom and return to Bouhdida, a dusty, unplanned neighborhood in Mauritania’s capital, Nouakchott, to re-create the day’s lessons for kids who couldn’t afford an education. Mauritania is an Islamic republic, with rich traditions in poetry and recitation that belie its dismal rates of literacy and economic growth. As a teen-ager, Salahi memorized the entire Quran.\n\n+++feature-small\n[#image: /photos/5cb10c4f92dcf02ddc860e1f]|||\n|||\n+++\n\nHe grew up measuring political eras by military coups—1978, 1979, 1984—changes _in_ power that did little to alter the ways in which Mauritanians _experienced_ power. The lack of progress, development, and freedom in Mauritanian society inspired in Salahi a righteous anger toward autocracy and corruption, and a desire to fight for something bigger than himself.\n\nIn the eighties, he and a younger cousin, a slender poet named Mahfouz Ould al-Walid, spent their evenings at a local café, where the owner showed videos of the Palestinian struggle and the jihad in Afghanistan, which the Soviet Union had invaded in 1979\\. In 1988, the Saudi ideologue Osama bin Laden announced the formation of Al Qaeda. Walid, who was thirteen, started reading bin Laden’s pamphlets. He and Salahi were smitten with the Al Qaeda narrative, that a ragtag group of mujahideen, carrying light weapons and hiding in caves, were taking on a superpower in the defense of all Muslims. They weren’t the only people taken by this struggle—the C.I.A. was funding and equipping many of the mujahideen groups.\n\nIn 1988, Salahi graduated from high school and won a scholarship to study engineering in Duisburg, Germany. He was the first person in his family to attend university. But the call to jihad interrupted his studies. By 1990, the Soviets had withdrawn from Afghanistan, but Al Qaeda was still fighting against the Communist Afghan government that the Soviets had installed. That December, shortly before his twentieth birthday, Salahi boarded a flight to Pakistan and crossed into Afghanistan, and although he never met bin Laden, he soon pledged his allegiance to the Al Qaeda leadership.\n\nWalid, who was sixteen, stayed behind. But two months later, when Salahi returned to Mauritania and described his experience of the jihad, Walid resolved to set off on his own for Afghanistan. Walid was a prodigious poet—in Nouakchott, he had won several awards—and when bin Laden met him he was impressed by his eloquence and conviction. Soon afterward, they travelled together to Sudan, where bin Laden ran a construction company and a jihadi training camp, and sped around Khartoum in bin Laden’s white Mercedes.\n\nIn the spring of 1992, Salahi returned to Afghanistan. Because he had no experience with weapons, Al Qaeda personnel sent him to the Al Farouq training camp, near Khost, where he learned how to use a Kalashnikov rifle and launch rocket-propelled grenades. But by then the Soviet Union had collapsed, and, while Salahi was in training, the Afghan government lost its Russian support. Afghanistan’s civil war entered a new stage, with rival Islamist groups vying for control, and Salahi wanted no part of it. After three months, he left Afghanistan and returned to Duisburg, where he worked in a computer-repair shop while he finished his degree.\n\nAnother two years passed before Salahi’s name caught the attention of Deddahi Ould Abdellahi, the head of Mauritania’s security-intelligence apparatus. In 1994, as the director of state security, he opened an investigation into Nouakchott’s jihadi scene. Several Mauritanians had travelled to battlefields in Afghanistan and Bosnia, and Mahfouz Walid had become an important figure in Al Qaeda; he now went by the nom de guerre Abu Hafs al-Mauritani. In Nouakchott, Abdellahi and his subordinates began to map out the network, detaining people close to Abu Hafs and soliciting the names of other jihadis. Several young men mentioned Salahi as a contact in Germany. With the assistance of German intelligence, Abdellahi told me, “we started collecting the maximum amount of information. How does he live? How does he behave? How does he react to world events?” It was unclear to Abdellahi whether Salahi was still active within Al Qaeda, but he seemed to be someone whom all the Mauritanian Islamists knew.\n\n-=-=-=\n\nAbu Hafs ascended to Al Qaeda’s Shura Council, where he served as bin Laden’s personal adviser on Sharia law. In 1996, when Abu Hafs was twenty-one, he drafted bin Laden’s most important fatwa: an eleven-thousand-word document excoriating the Saudi Kingdom and warning the U.S. Secretary of Defense that Al Qaeda’s adherents “have no intention except to enter paradise by killing you.” The fatwa was Al Qaeda’s declaration of war against the United States. According to “The Exile,” a comprehensive account of post-9/11 Al Qaeda, by the investigative journalists Cathy Scott-Clark and Adrian Levy, who gained access to Abu Hafs’s diaries, he ghostwrote “most of Osama’s speeches, religious judgments, and press releases.” In 1998, bin Laden wrote Abu Hafs into his will.\n\nAround that time, after a long period without contact, Abu Hafs called Salahi from bin Laden’s satellite phone. The cousins had married a pair of sisters, and so they were now also brothers-in-law. But, after Salahi returned to Germany, they had scarcely been in touch. While Abu Hafs was handling Al Qaeda’s affairs in East Africa, his father became ill, and so, as both men remember it, Abu Hafs requested Salahi’s help in transferring money to care for his family in Mauritania. Salahi agreed, and Abu Hafs wired around four thousand dollars to his German account. Salahi withdrew the cash and gave it to friends who were travelling to Nouakchott, and they delivered it to Abu Hafs’s family.\n\nA similar phone call, followed by a second transaction, took place in December, 1998\\. But, after Abu Hafs used bin Laden’s phone to call a different cousin in Nouakchott, Abdellahi’s subordinates took the cousin into custody, and tortured him for two months. So, when Abu Hafs called Salahi for assistance a third time, in early 1999, Salahi refused, and hung up.\n\nAl Qaeda had by this time transformed into an international terrorist organization that was launching attacks in East Africa and the Middle East. The U.S. had fired cruise missiles at Al Qaeda-linked targets in Sudan and Afghanistan, and, in a bid to capture Abu Hafs, the C.I.A. had raided a hotel in Khartoum. (He escaped through a kitchen door.) One night in October, 1999, a friend of Salahi’s asked him to host three Muslims who were passing through Duisburg. Over dinner, they explained that they were heading east, for the jihad. The men slept on his floor and left for Afghanistan at dawn. Salahi didn’t know their real names, and never heard from them again.\n\nBy now, Salahi was under surveillance by German intelligence. But the Germans saw no reason to detain or question him. According to an investigation by _Der Spiegel_, “he preached in gloomy back-yard mosques,” and remained in occasional contact with jihadis—men whose names and cell-phone numbers would turn up in investigations spanning Africa, Europe, North America, and the Middle East. But he did not consider himself a member of Al Qaeda, or a facilitator of its operations. One day, German officers questioned one of Salahi’s friends. When they asked whether Salahi was involved in any terrorist activities, the friend laughed.\n\nBut Salahi wanted to live free of surveillance, and he decided to leave the country. One of Salahi’s friends, who was now living in Canada, suggested that he move to Montreal. “He said, ‘Canada is amazing—there is no racism, they speak French, and it is just a very advanced country,’ ” Salahi said years later, in a U.S. military hearing. “You will have a job at the snap of a finger,” his friend told him. Ramadan was approaching—when the men leading prayers read aloud the entire Quran during the course of a lunar cycle—and, Salahi recalled, “my friend said, ‘We need you here in Canada because we have no Hafez,’ ” the Arabic word for a man who can recite the Quran from memory. “In Arabic countries there are oodles, but in Europe and Canada one is very rare.”\n\nSalahi landed in Montreal on November 26, 1999\\. (His wife returned to Nouakchott.) His friend, Hosni Mohsen, introduced him to the imam at the Al Sunnah mosque. The mosque had thousands of attendees, a few of whom belonged to an Algerian jihadi group that had come to the attention of the French and Canadian intelligence services. “Bad people always want to blend into a crowd,” Salahi explained at the military hearing. Some of Mohsen’s “bad friends,” as Salahi described them, visited Mohsen’s apartment while he was hosting Salahi.\n\n“So look at me,” Salahi said. “I have contact with Osama bin Laden’s operative, who was helping launder money. I’m now in Canada, attending a mosque where we believe a very dangerous group is attending.” And, because it was Ramadan, Salahi was leading prayers. “Something is going on.”\n\n“It’s not looking good,” the presiding military officer replied.\n\n“No, it’s not looking good at all,” Salahi said. “It will look worse.”\n\n-=-=-=\n\nOne of the Algerian jihadis was Ahmed Ressam, a serial thief who was living in Canada under a false identity. In 1998, he had travelled to Afghanistan, and spent a year in Al Qaeda training camps, where he learned to handle weapons and explosives. In the spring of 1999, French intelligence officers asked their Canadian counterparts if they could question Ressam about jihadi activities in Europe, but the Canadians couldn’t locate him, because he had entered the country on a fake passport.\n\nA week after Salahi began leading prayers at the Al Sunnah mosque, Ressam drove a rental car onto a U.S.-bound ferry in Victoria, British Columbia. When the boat reached Port Angeles, near Seattle, customs officers found in the car more than a hundred pounds of explosives, along with four timed detonators, each fashioned from a nine-volt battery, a circuit board, and a Casio watch. Ressam told investigators that he had planned to detonate suitcases in a crowded terminal at Los Angeles International Airport.\n\n+++inset-left\n[#cartoon: /cartoon/5cb10c4faaf4e60f45f6a640]||||||\n+++\n\nAfter the failed attack, Canada began to aggressively investigate the Montreal cell. “They were very jumpy,” Salahi recalled at his hearing. “They were everywhere in the mosque, in the police car, twenty-four hours.” Among the targets of the investigation was Mohsen, Salahi’s friend and host. Upon Mohsen’s arrest, according to a court filing, investigators found “pocket litter” that included “both Salahi’s name and Ressam’s phone number.” (Mohsen could not be reached for comment.)\n\nOne night, Salahi awoke to the sound of a tiny hole being drilled into his wall. The next morning, he found two pinhole cameras. Salahi called the police to report that his neighbors were spying on him, but they told him that he should just cover the cameras with glue. Soon afterward, Canadian investigators came to the apartment and questioned him about the Millennium Plot. “I was scared to hell,” Salahi recalled at his hearing. “They asked me do I know Ahmed Ressam. I said, ‘No.’ ” (Investigators later determined that Ressam had left Montreal for a safe house in Vancouver on November 17th—nine days before Salahi arrived in Canada.) He began to notice surveillance everywhere. “O.K., screw it, it is not a problem—they can watch me,” he said. “They were afraid that I would kill some people.”\n\nIn Mauritania, Abdellahi’s men detained Salahi’s wife and brothers and interrogated them about the Millennium Plot. “They didn’t tell me, because they were scared,” Salahi recalled. But his family members were eager for Salahi to return, and so they told him that his mother was ill.\n\nOn January 21, 2000, Salahi boarded a flight to Senegal. It was cheaper to fly to Dakar than to Nouakchott, and his brothers drove three hundred miles to meet him there. As they left baggage claim, Salahi later wrote in his diary, “my hands were shackled behind my back and I was encircled by a bunch of ghosts who cut me off from the rest of my company. At first I thought it was an armed robbery,” but, when the airport police approached, “the guy behind me flashed a magic badge, which immediately made the policemen retreat.” Salahi and his brothers were thrown into the back of a van and driven to a detention site.\n\nBefore dawn, Salahi was taken to an interrogation room. An American woman, who he assumed was an intelligence officer, entered the room, and stood by as a Senegalese officer questioned him about the Millennium Plot. Salahi denied knowing Ahmed Ressam, and added that he thought the entire narrative around the attack had been concocted “to unlock the terrorism budget and hurt the Muslims.” At the time, he later wrote, “I believed excessively in Conspiracy Theories—though maybe not as much as the U.S. government does.”\n\nBy the following day, the lead Senegalese officer was convinced that there was no reason to hold Salahi. “I was happy because the one-ton stack of paper the U.S. government had provided the Senegalese about me didn’t seem to impress them,” Salahi wrote. “It didn’t take my interrogator a whole lot of time to understand the situation.” Another American official arrived, and took Salahi’s photograph and fingerprints. Soon afterward, Salahi’s brothers were released with instructions to return to Mauritania. They were told not to wait for Salahi.\n\nSeveral more days of interrogation followed. The Senegalese did the talking, but the Americans provided the questions and reported back to D.C. Eventually, one of the interrogators told Salahi that he was going to be sent to Mauritania for more questioning. He was terrified—he wanted to go back to Canada, where interrogators behaved within the bounds of the law.\n\nSalahi was led to a small private aircraft. The journey to Nouakchott took roughly an hour, tracing the Mauritanian coast—to the left the Atlantic, to the right the Sahara. Salahi, who hadn’t been home since 1993, was filled with nostalgia and dread. “Through the window I started to see the sand-covered small villages around Nouakchott, as bleak as their prospects,” he wrote.\n\nThe plane landed at sunset. A security guard handed him a filthy black turban, to hide his face during the drive to the secret-police headquarters. There, an intelligence officer named Yacoub confiscated Salahi’s Quran and left him in a dank cell. He tried to sleep, but his mind was racing with the expectation of torture at dawn. “I’d read about Muslim heroes who faced the death penalty, head up,” he wrote. “How did they do it?”\n\n-=-=-=\n\nThe next morning, Salahi was led to the office of the Mauritanian intelligence chief, Deddahi Ould Abdellahi. “The room was large and well-furnished,” Salahi wrote, with a portrait of the President “conveying the weakness of the law and the strength of the government.” In the course of the next several days, Abdellahi and his men, citing the concerns of the American government, interrogated Salahi about his time in Afghanistan, his contact with his cousin Abu Hafs, and the Millennium Plot. The men never abused Salahi, but, as the days became weeks, he wished that they would just turn him over to the United States, where, he assumed, he could at least challenge the legal grounds of his detention.\n\nAfter roughly three weeks, F.B.I. agents visited Salahi’s cell. Their questions were much the same, Salahi wrote, but “the whole environmental setup made me very skeptical toward the honesty and humanity of the U.S. interrogators. It was kind of like, ‘We ain’t gonna beat you ourselves, but you know where you are!’ So I knew the FBI wanted to interrogate me under the pressure and threat of a non-democratic country.”\n\nOn February 19, 2000, Abdellahi let him go home. “We had done all our investigations, and we found nothing against Salahi,” Abdellahi told me. Abdellahi’s men confiscated his passport, once again citing a request by the Americans. But a friend helped him find work installing Internet routers for a telecommunications company. “It sucked that I didn’t have the freedom to travel,” Salahi recalled in the military hearing. “But, hey, I have to cope with it. So far, so good.”\n\n## Dry Ice\n\n-=-=-=\n\nOn a Tuesday afternoon in September, 2001, one of bin Laden’s messengers sought out Salahi’s cousin, Abu Hafs, and told him to keep an eye on the news. Abu Hafs was back in Afghanistan, living with his family in Kandahar. It had been five years since the Taliban had taken over most of the country, and televisions were banned. He grabbed his shortwave radio. In the U.S., it was morning. He knew what he expected to hear.\n\nThe first rumors of a “planes operation” began circulating among Al Qaeda leaders in 1999\\. But it wasn’t until two years later that bin Laden shared with the Shura Council the broad outlines of the attack: four planes; two civilian targets; two government targets. In that meeting, Abu Hafs challenged bin Laden on Quranic grounds, arguing that the scale of civilian casualties could not be justified in Islam. He added that such an attack would be a betrayal of Al Qaeda’s agreement with the Taliban government, which had provided sanctuary for the group on the understanding that it would do nothing to provoke a full-scale U.S. invasion. Later that summer, Abu Hafs wrote a twelve-page dissent, but bin Laden bristled at his defiance, and the objections of other Al Qaeda leaders, and moved forward. In July, 2001, according to Scott-Clark and Levy, the authors of “The Exile,” Abu Hafs handed bin Laden his resignation letter. Bin Laden, wary of Al Qaeda’s fragility, urged him not to speak publicly of his departure. For the next two months, Abu Hafs taught jihadi recruits at a madrassa.\n\nAfter the attacks, Cofer Black, the head of the C.I.A.’s Counterterrorism Center, who had served as the agency’s Khartoum station chief while bin Laden was in Sudan, assured President George W. Bush that men like Abu Hafs would soon “have flies walking across their eyeballs.” The next day, he ordered Gary Schroen, the agency’s former Kabul station chief, to gather a team for a paramilitary mission. “I want to see photos of their heads on pikes,” Black said, according to Schroen’s memoir, “First In,” published in 2005\\. “I want bin Ladin’s head shipped back in a box filled with dry ice. I want to be able to show bin Ladin’s head to the President.” Black added that he and Bush wanted to avoid the spectacle of a courtroom trial. “It was the first time in my thirty-year CIA career that I had ever heard an order to kill someone,” Schroen wrote.\n\nOn September 26th, Schroen and six other officers loaded an aging Soviet helicopter with weapons, tactical gear, and three million dollars in used, nonconsecutive bills. They took off from Uzbekistan and flew into northern Afghanistan, over the snow-capped mountains of the Hindu Kush. There, Schroen contacted the leaders of the Northern Alliance, an armed group that had spent years fighting the Taliban, with little external support. Schroen recalled, “When I began to distribute money—two hundred thousand dollars here, two hundred and fifty thousand dollars for this—I think that they were convinced that we were sincere.” In the next few weeks, Schroen’s C.I.A. team and their Afghan counterparts travelled through much of northern Afghanistan, laying the groundwork for the U.S. military invasion.\n\n-=-=-=\n\nIn Nouakchott, Abdellahi’s men detained Salahi again in the fall of 2001, at the request of the Americans. “I really have no questions for you, because I know your case,” Abdellahi told him. Salahi had deleted the contents of his phone. “All I had were some numbers of business partners in Mauritania and Germany,” he later wrote, “but I didn’t want the U.S. government harassing those peaceful people just because I had their numbers in my phone.” One of the contacts was listed as “P.C. Laden”—German for “computer shop”—and he figured that, to the Americans, “Laden” would be a red flag.\n\n+++inset-left\n[#cartoon: /cartoon/5cb10c4feb7a592e91934293]||||||\n+++\n\nA couple of weeks into his detention, two F.B.I. agents walked into the cell. “Where is Abu Hafs?” one of them asked.\n\n“I am not in Afghanistan,” Salahi replied. How could he possibly know? The interrogations always circled back to the Millennium Plot. Salahi came to think of his interrogators as acting out a Mauritanian folktale in which a blind man is given the gift of a single, fleeting glimpse of the world. “All he saw was a rat,” Salahi wrote. “After that, whenever anybody tried to explain anything to the guy, he always asked, ‘Compare it with the rat: Is it bigger? smaller?’ ”\n\nOne of the F.B.I. agents threatened Salahi with torture, and tried to intimidate him. “He said he was going to bring in black people,” Salahi recalled, in the military hearing. “I don’t have a problem with black people—half my country is black people!” But the agent kept using racial slurs. “This was my first time hearing these words,” Salahi said. “Like, what is a ‘motherfucker’? That is not appropriate language, man. He was very silly. He told me he hated Jews also. . . . I told him I have no problem with the Jews, either, man. Anyway, he said, ‘I know you are part of the Millennium Plot.’ ”\n\nA few days later, Salahi was released. Abdellahi called Salahi’s boss at the telecommunications company, to assure him that Salahi should be allowed to resume work. While in custody, Salahi had befriended Yacoub, the intelligence officer who had been one of his guards. Yacoub had a large family and a small salary, so, when Salahi was released, he started paying Yacoub to do occasional tasks. Though Salahi was a skilled electrician, he hired Yacoub to fix his TV.\n\n-=-=-=\n\nNot long afterward, in mid-November, Salahi’s boss sent him to Mauritania’s Presidential palace, to install Internet routers and update the phones. “I thought there would be a lot of formalities, especially for a ‘terrorist suspect’ such as myself, but nothing like that happened,” Salahi wrote. “After all, only the Americans suspect me of terrorism, no other country. The irony is that I have never been in the States, and all the other countries I have been in kept saying, ‘The guy is alright.’ ”\n\nAfter work, Salahi went to his mother’s house. Two intelligence officers, including Yacoub, arrived and said that Abdellahi needed to see him again. One of the arresting agents suggested that Salahi drive his own car to the station, so that he could drive himself home afterward. Yacoub climbed into the passenger seat. “Salahi, I wish I were not part of this shit,” he said.\n\nNeither of them knew that the United States had asked Mauritania’s President to hand over Salahi to a rendition team. “He was guilty of nothing,” Abdellahi told me, and he had not been charged with a crime. “That’s why we had previously let him go.” But, Abdellahi continued, shrugging, “to refuse a demand from an intelligence agency, in the fight against terrorism—that would have been impossible.”\n\nOn the evening of November 28th—Mauritania’s Independence Day—Salahi had been in custody for a week. Abdellahi had bought him a new outfit, but Salahi had refused to eat, and the fabric was loose on his shoulders. They drove to the airport in silence, in Abdellahi’s black Mercedes. “He was not happy—he didn’t want to leave,” Abdellahi told me. “But I wasn’t the decider. I was an agent of the state. I executed orders. And I knew that the request was justified, because he had connections in this milieu, these Islamo-terrorist circles, and he might be able to give his captors some ideas of how to improve security. That was my thinking—that he was sufficiently intelligent and well informed to help any intelligence service that might ask him for help.”\n\nIt was Ramadan again. “I pictured my family already having prepared the Iftar fast-breaking food, my mom mumbling her prayers while duly working the modest delicacies, everybody looking for the sun to take its last steps and hide beneath the horizon,” Salahi wrote. He and Abdellahi knelt on the runway, and prayed together.\n\nA private jet landed, and out climbed a Jordanian rendition team. The lead officer couldn’t speak Mauritania’s Hassaniya Arabic, and Abdellahi hardly understood the Jordanian dialect, so Salahi translated for them. “He said he needs fuel,” Salahi explained to Abdellahi. (In his diary, Salahi wrote, “I was eager to let my predator know, _I am, I am_.”) When the conversation was over, the Jordanians blindfolded Salahi and put a set of soundproof earmuffs on him. Salahi was terrified. “I thought it was a new U.S. method to suck intels out of your brain and send them directly to a main computer which analyzes the information,” he wrote. “It was silly, but if you get scared you are not you anymore. You very much become a child again.”\n\n-=-=-=\n\nIn Amman, Jordan, Salahi was hooded and taken to a detention facility in the headquarters of the country’s General Intelligence Directorate. (After 9/11, the directorate acted as a proxy jailer for the C.I.A.) The interrogations covered the same topics as before: Abu Hafs; Al Qaeda’s training camps in 1992; the Millennium Plot. The Americans supplied the questions, and the Jordanians extracted the responses, often through coercive means. Salahi was asked about innocuous exchanges from intercepted e-mails and phone calls, as if they had been conducted in code. At other times, the questions originated from material on his hard drive, which the F.B.I. had copied in Nouakchott. Once, on a technical assignment, Salahi had been photographed near the President of Mauritania; now the lead interrogator accused Salahi of having plotted to kill him.\n\nStill, Salahi found his Jordanian interrogators to be highly knowledgeable, and they developed a kind of mutual respect. “It is a fact that they understand this whole concept of terrorism much better than the average American interrogator,” Salahi said, in his military hearing. “They really know who is who,” and, as a result, “they were very reluctant to torture me. It was not every day, the torture—I would say maybe twice a week.” While other detainees were mercilessly beaten, strung up by their limbs, and sexually assaulted, he added, “all they did was strike me at different times in the face, and hit me against the concrete wall.”\n\nThe guards, who were officially prohibited from interacting with him, began asking questions. “Where are you from?” one of them said.\n\n“Mauritania.”\n\n“What are you doing in Jordan?”\n\n“My country turned me over.”\n\n“Are you kidding me?”\n\n+++inset-left\n[#cartoon: /cartoon/5cb10c4ffa6e963887a69639]||||||\n+++\n\n“No.”\n\n“Your country is fucked up.”\n\nThe guards also brought him books from the library, including the Bible, which he had requested, he wrote, “because I wanted to study the book that must more or less have shaped the lives of the Americans.”\n\nEvery other week, when Red Cross representatives visited the prison, Salahi and a handful of other C.I.A. detainees were whisked to the cellar, to be hidden from view. In Nouakchott, Abdellahi waited for updates from the C.I.A. and the G.I.D., but received none. “I thought he’d be back in no time,” he told me.\n\nSalahi’s family wasn’t notified of his rendition, and so they were surprised that Abdellahi refused to let them see him. According to one of Salahi’s brothers, Abdellahi told the family that Salahi was being kept in a detention facility in the desert, far from Nouakchott. (Abdellahi says that, after Salahi disappeared, the family never contacted him.) To insure Salahi’s upkeep, the family regularly gave Abdellahi’s men money, food, clothes, and gifts. In return, they passed along messages from Salahi, which they had invented, and assured the family that Salahi was well.\n\n-=-=-=\n\nIn Kandahar, Abu Hafs felt the Americans closing in. The Taliban was rapidly losing ground. On October 17, 2001, Abu Hafs’s madrassa took a direct hit from a missile. One day in November, after burying several friends, Abu Hafs sought out an Al Jazeera journalist. His turban was still damp from where his wife had cleaned off other people’s blood. “The Americans, with their policies, bore the fruit of the events of September 11th,” Abu Hafs said on camera. “Striking horror, panic, and fear in the hearts of the enemies of Allah is a divine commandment.” He added that American citizens should blame their law-enforcement and intelligence agencies—with their “satellites, ground stations, millions of spies, and huge budgets”—for the fact that the hijackers had “found a security breach as big as a whole fleet of hijacked civilian aircraft, and managed to shove America’s nose into the ground.”\n\nBy the second week of December, it was clear that Kandahar would fall. Bin Laden had fled to the mountains, and the remaining Al Qaeda leaders understood that, as Arabs and North Africans, they could never blend in with the locals, who spoke Dari, Pashto, Balochi, and other regional languages. (For the first several weeks of the invasion, Donald Rumsfeld, the Secretary of Defense, believed that everyone spoke “Afghan.”) In a rush to leave Kandahar, two dozen senior Al Qaeda officials boarded a bus, but Abu Hafs, fearful that a single air strike could decapitate the jihadi movement, urged them to disperse.\n\nDuring the next several days, Abu Hafs travelled toward the Pakistani province of Balochistan. He slept in remote villages, and entrusted his life to Afghan sheepherders who were presumably unaware of the twenty-five-million-dollar bounty on his head. He wrote a letter to his wife and children, but there was no way to send it, and so he kept it in a pocket in his robes.\n\nWhen Abu Hafs reached Quetta, in Pakistan, he found the city’s private hospital filled with injured Al Qaeda members. Taliban fighters walked the streets, confident in the support they received from Pakistan’s intelligence service. Abu Hafs, however, regarded the Pakistanis as duplicitous. (The C.I.A. came to much the same conclusion.) Bin Laden’s family was en route to Pakistan, and Abu Hafs needed to make arrangements for their protection. In deliberations with Al Qaeda leaders, he decided that the safest place was Iran.\n\nOn December 19th, Abu Hafs boarded a bus in Quetta, carrying a fake passport and a suitcase full of cash. An image of bin Laden’s face adorned the windshield, and Abu Hafs spent much of the journey to the Iranian border, some four hundred miles, wondering whether it was a “Wanted” poster or a tribute. At a Pakistani Army checkpoint, he slipped a wad of bills into his passport, and went through unquestioned.\n\nIn Iran, Abu Hafs was greeted by representatives of a secretive and élite Revolutionary Guard Corps unit that is responsible for protecting top officials. A few weeks later, Iranian spies told Abu Hafs to call other Al Qaeda officials and inform them that they would be welcome in Iran—although, like him, they would live with their wives and children under a form of house arrest, sometimes in prisons, sometimes in lavish compounds and hotels, always in the company of the Revolutionary Guard. The decision to simultaneously protect and detain Al Qaeda members was apparently made by Iran’s spy chief, Qassem Suleimani. Within a few months, dozens of Al Qaeda members were living in Tehran, undergoing occasional interrogations, aware that their Iranian hosts could betray them at any moment. Abu Hafs spent the next decade in relative luxury, exercising alongside foreign diplomats in one of Tehran’s swankiest gyms, and looking after bin Laden’s sons along with his own. The Pentagon had reported that he was dead.\n\n-=-=-=\n\nOn the night of July 19, 2002, the Jordanians transported Mohamedou Salahi, blindfolded and in chains, to the airport in Amman, where a new team took over. At first, Salahi was relieved—he assumed that the Americans had come to understand his irrelevance to 9/11 and the Millennium Plot, and that he was being sent back to Mauritania. Instead, the men stripped him naked, strapped a diaper on him, and swapped out his shackles for a heavier set. One of the men momentarily removed Salahi’s blindfold, and shined a flashlight into his eyes. Everyone on the team was dressed entirely in black, their faces obscured by balaclavas. They drove up to the stairs of an airplane, but, Salahi wrote, he was “so exhausted, sick, and tired that I couldn’t walk, which compelled the escort to pull me up the steps like a dead body.”\n\nAt sunrise, the plane landed at Bagram Airfield, the largest U.S. military base in Afghanistan. For the first time, Salahi was in the custody of uniformed American soldiers. “Where is Mullah Omar?” they asked. “Where is Osama bin Laden?” They shouted and threw objects against the wall. Salahi had been living in a cell practically since the beginning of the invasion, nine months earlier.\n\nMilitary personnel took his biometric information, and logged his health problems—including a damaged sciatic nerve—then led him to a cell. The punishment for talking to another detainee was to be hung by the wrists, feet barely touching the ground. Salahi saw a mentally ill old man subjected to this method. “He couldn’t stop talking because he didn’t know where he was, nor why,” Salahi wrote.\n\nDuring interrogations, an intelligence officer, known among the detainees as William the Torturer, forced Salahi into stress positions that exacerbated his sciatic-nerve issues. “His specialty was in brutalizing detainees who were considered important, but not valuable enough to get them tickets to the secret CIA prisons,” Salahi wrote. Another officer tried to build rapport with Salahi by speaking to him in German. “_Wahrheit macht frei_,” the officer said—the truth sets you free. “When I heard him say that, I knew the truth wouldn’t set me free, because ‘_Arbeit_ ’ didn’t set the Jews free,” Salahi recalled. (The phrase “Work sets you free” appeared on the gates of Auschwitz and other Nazi concentration camps.)\n\nEach detainee was given a number, and, on August 4th, thirty-four of those numbers were called, including Salahi’s. The men were dragged out of their cells. Military police officers put blackout goggles over their eyes and mittens on their hands, then hooded them, lined them up, and tied each detainee to the one in front of him and the one behind him. Then the men were loaded onto an airplane. “When my turn came, two guards grabbed me by the hands and feet and threw me toward the reception team,” Salahi wrote. “I don’t remember whether I hit the floor or was caught by the other guards. I had started to lose feeling and it would have made no difference anyway.”\n\nFor some thirty hours, Salahi was strapped to a board. Medical records indicate that he weighed a hundred and nine pounds—around thirty per cent less than his normal weight. He was belted so tightly that he struggled to breathe, but he didn’t have the English vocabulary to tell the guards.\n\nThen, he wrote, the plane landed, the doors opened, and “the warm Cuban sun hit me gracefully. It was such a good feeling.”\n\n## ENEMY COMBATANTS\n\n+++inset-left\n[#cartoon: /cartoon/5cb10c4f99f58121fe04dbdb]||||||\n+++\n\n-=-=-=\n\nIn the minutes before the first detainees set foot on Guantánamo, “you could literally hear a pin drop,” Brandon Neely, a military-police officer, recalled, in an interview with the Guantánamo Testimonials Project, at the University of California, Davis, in 2008\\. “Everyone, including myself, was very nervous,” he said. It was January 11, 2002\\. The Bush Administration had decided that the Geneva Conventions did not apply to the war on terror, which meant that the men captured abroad could be deprived of the rights of prisoners of war. That day, Neely’s job was to haul captives from a bus to a holding area for processing, and then to small, outdoor cages, where they would spend nearly four months sleeping on rocks, and relieving themselves in buckets, while soldiers constructed more permanent cellblocks. “I keep thinking, Here it comes—I am fixing to see what a terrorist looks like face to face,” Neely, who was twenty-one at the time, said.\n\nThe first man off the bus had only one leg. He wore handcuffs, leg shackles, earmuffs, blackout goggles, a surgical mask, and a bright-orange jumpsuit. As two M.P.s dragged him to the holding area, someone tossed his prosthetic leg out of the bus. All afternoon, guards screamed at the detainees to shut up and walk faster, called them “sand niggers,” and said that their family members and countries had been obliterated by nuclear bombs.\n\nLater that day, Neely and his partner brought an elderly detainee to the holding area and forced him to his knees. When they removed his shackles, the man, who was shaking with fear, suddenly jerked to the left. Neely jumped on top of him, and forced his face into the concrete floor. An officer shouted “Code Red!” into a radio, and the Internal Reaction Force team raced to the scene and hog-tied him. He was left for hours in the Caribbean sun.\n\nNeely later found out that the elderly detainee had jerked because, when he was forced to his knees, he thought he was about to be shot in the back of the head. In his home country, Neely said, “this man had seen some of his friends and family members executed on their knees.” The man’s response was hardly unique; a military document, drafted ten days later for the base commander, noted that “the detainees think they are being taken to be shot.”\n\nOfficially, the job of the Internal Reaction Force was to restrain unruly detainees, to prevent them from injuring themselves or the guards. But, in practice, “*IRF*{: .small}ing” was often done as a form of revenge, initiated liberally—for example, when a detainee was found to have two plastic cups instead of one, or refused to drink a bottle of Ensure, because he thought that he was being given poison. *IRF*{: .small}ing typically involved a team of six or more men dressed in riot gear: the first man would pepper-spray the detainee, then charge into the cell and, using a heavy shield and his body weight, tackle the detainee; the rest would jump on top, shackling or binding the detainee until he was no longer moving. Although many of the detainees arrived malnourished, with their bodies marked by bullet wounds and broken bones, some *IRF*{: .small} teams punched them and slammed their heads into the ground until they were bloody and unconscious. “You could always tell when someone got *IRF*{: .small}ed, as the detainees throughout the camp would start chanting and screaming,” Neely recalled. Once, he watched an *IRF*{: .small} team leader beat a detainee so badly that he had to be sent to the hospital and the floor of his cell was stained with blood; the next time the team leader was in the cellblock, another detainee yelled out, “Sergeant, have you come back to finish him off?”\n\nIn Islam, the Quran is considered the transcribed word of God; some Muslims keep the book wrapped in cloth, never letting it touch unclean surfaces. To dispel notions that the United States was at war with Islam, detainees were allowed to have private meetings with a Muslim military chaplain, and were given copies of the Quran. Some guards saw an opportunity to torment the detainees—by tossing the Quran into the toilet, for example, or by breaking the binding under the guise of searching for “weapons.” Desecration of the Quran provoked riots in the cellblocks, which resulted in *IRF*{: .small} teams storming into the cells and beating up detainees.\n\nOne day, after an interrogator kicked a Quran across the floor, detainees organized a mass suicide attempt. “Once every fifteen minutes, a prisoner tried to hang himself by tying his sheet around his neck and fastening it through the mesh of the cage wall,” James Yee, an Army captain who served as the Muslim chaplain in Guantánamo, recalled in his memoir, “For God and Country,” from 2005\\. “As soon as the prisoner was taken to the hospital, another detainee would be found—his sheet wound around his neck and tied to his cage wall. The guards would rush in to save him and the chaos would start again. The protest lasted for several days as twenty-three prisoners tried to hang themselves.”\n\nMilitary-police officers so frequently abused the Quran during cell searches that detainees demanded that the books be kept in the library, where they would be safe. Yee, who had converted to Islam in the early nineties, sent a request up the chain of command, but was rebuffed. “I felt this decision stemmed from the command’s desire to be able to tell the media that we gave all detainees a Quran out of sensitivity to their religious needs,” he wrote. The detainees protested, and so “it was decided that every detainee who refused the Quran would be *IRF*{: .small}ed.” While the detainees were receiving medical treatment for their post-*IRF*{: .small} injuries, the Qurans were placed back in their cells.\n\nIn time, Yee came to believe that “Islam was systematically used as a weapon against the prisoners.” Guards mocked the call to prayer, and manipulated Islamic principles of modesty—by having female guards watch naked detainees in the showers, for example—to create tension as an excuse to exact violence. During interrogations, detainees were forced to perform mock satanic rituals, or were draped in the Israeli flag.\n\nDonald Rumsfeld told reporters that the men in Guantánamo were “among the most dangerous, best-trained, vicious killers on the face of the earth.” But after Brandon Neely’s first shift, on the day the detention camp opened, “no one really spoke much,” he recalled. “I went back to my tent and laid down to go to sleep. I was thinking, Those were the worst people the world had to offer?”\n\n-=-=-=\n\nInvestigators had the same question. Shortly before the first detainees arrived, Robert McFadden, an N.C.I.S. special agent, was eager to receive the flight manifest. “I just couldn’t wait to see who the detainees were,” he told me. He had spent much of the past fifteen months in Yemen, investigating Al Qaeda’s bombing of the U.S.S. Cole, and hoped that some of the men who were being shipped to Guantánamo would have information about the case. But, when the list of detainees finally arrived, he recalled, “my reaction was, What the fuck? Who are these guys?” Most of the names were Afghan or Pakistani, “and the Arabs who were on the list certainly weren’t recognizable to me and my colleagues who had been working Al Qaeda for years.” A few weeks later, after McFadden visited the detention camp, he concluded that the detainees were “essentially nobodies.” He told me, “There was not anyone approaching even the most liberal interpretation of a ‘high-value detainee.’ ”\n\nIn Afghanistan, the U.S. military was inadvertently presiding over a kidnapping-and-ransom industry. Helicopters dropped flyers in remote Afghan villages, offering “wealth and power beyond your dreams” to anyone who turned in a member of Al Qaeda or the Taliban. “You can receive millions of dollars,” one of the flyers said. “This is enough money to take care of your family, your village, your tribe for the rest of your life.” A common bounty was five thousand dollars—far more money than most Afghans earned in a year—and “the result was an explosion of human trafficking” by various armed groups, Mark Fallon, the deputy commander of Guantánamo’s Criminal Investigation Task Force, wrote in his memoir, “Unjustifiable Means,” which was heavily redacted before being published, in 2017\\. As Michael Lehnert, a Marine Corps major general who briefly served as the detention camp’s first commander, later testified to Congress, “What better way to enrich yourself, while resolving old grudges, than to finger a neighbor who was your enemy, regardless of his support for either Al Qaeda or the Taliban?”\n\nAccording to Fallon, “The Northern Alliance would jam so many detainees into Conex shipping containers that they started to die of suffocation. Not wanting to lose their bounties, the captors sprayed the tops of the boxes with machine guns to open ventilation holes. A lot of these prisoners were actually looking forward to being handed over to the Americans, figuring it would be pretty obvious they weren’t Al Qaeda.” Yet hundreds of them were sent to Guantánamo Bay, which ended up housing seven hundred and eighty people.\n\nIn public, the Bush Administration and its military leadership asserted that Guantánamo was filled with men who would stop at nothing to destroy the U.S. But, on the base, Fallon and his colleagues referred to most detainees as “dirt farmers.” Lehnert lamented, “It takes an Army captain to send someone to Gitmo, and the President of the United States to get them out.”\n\n-=-=-=\n\nSalahi was no dirt farmer. But the C.I.A., which spent the next few years shuffling its “high-value detainees” among so-called black sites in Africa, Asia, and Eastern Europe, had seen fit to transfer him into military custody. By the time Salahi arrived at Guantánamo, on August 5, 2002, Fallon’s élite interagency criminal-investigation task force had been sidelined, and Lehnert had been replaced.\n\nThe leadership at Guantánamo was more interested in intelligence collection than in prosecuting detainees for terrorism crimes. But, when the new commander asked Stuart Herrington, a retired colonel and Army intelligence officer, to assess operations at the facility, Herrington found that most interrogators lacked the training and the experience required to be effective. Only one of the twenty-six interrogators was capable of working without an interpreter. Herrington later reported that the interrogators were unsure of the real names of more than half the detainees.\n\nAccording to Fallon, most of the interrogators were “basically conscripts” who would “walk into a room for the first time thinking the detainee was just waiting to be cracked open and they were the next Jack Bauer,” the fictional protagonist of “24,” who used abusive tactics to elicit information and save his city from terrorist attacks. They went through checklists of questions that had been developed by their superiors, and seemed impervious to nuance, or to the notion that some detainees may have been sent there in error. In response, detainees would stop coöperating and start chanting or praying; in an attempt to reassert control, Fallon wrote, “the interrogators would duct-tape their mouths, further guaranteeing that they wouldn’t get any information—and so it would go.” Nevertheless, he recalled, each failed interrogation “was taken as proof that the detainees were both Al Qaeda and trained to resist these methods.” In 2000, investigators in northern England had discovered a jihadi field manual that included advice on lying to captors. Now, faced with their own incompetence, Fallon wrote, interrogators “were quick to blame ‘classic Manchester resistance tactics!’ ”\n\n+++inset-left\n[#cartoon: /cartoon/5cb10c4f5c06990ba71570e0]||||||\n+++\n\nSalahi’s detainee dossier lists his “reasons for transfer” to Guantánamo: “to provide information” on the Al Qaeda training camp he had attended in 1992; a separate Afghan militia, which had received substantial backing from the C.I.A.; mosques in Duisburg; and his cousin Abu Hafs al-Mauritani. (They were no longer brothers-in-law, as Salahi and his wife had divorced.) Notably absent is any mention of the Millennium Plot, or any allegation that Salahi had committed a crime.\n\nAfter Salahi was processed, he spent thirty days in a cold isolation cell, a practice that the U.S. government considered “a main building block of the exploitation process,” as it “allows the captor total control over personal inputs.” When the isolation period was over, Salahi learned from other detainees that there was a difference in opinion between those who had lived in European democracies and those who had lived only in Muslim countries, with the latter group arguing that America’s war on terror was an anti-Muslim crusade. Salahi tried to convince the skeptics that their arrival in Cuba was “a blessing,” and that they would be treated fairly and exonerated by the American justice system. But, “with every day going by, the optimists lost ground,” he wrote. Bush Administration lawyers had taken the position that “enemy combatants” could be held indefinitely, without trials, and that in order for something to qualify as “torture” it “must be equivalent in intensity to the pain accompanying serious physical injury, such as organ failure, impairment of bodily function, or even death.” By the end of the following year, Salahi knew more about classified security operations than any private American citizen. The gulf between the U.S. government’s public disclosures and its secret practices was etched into his body and his mind.\n\n-=-=-=\n\nIn 1967, Martin Seligman, a twenty-four-year-old Ph.D. student in psychology, conducted an experiment that involved delivering electric shocks to dogs in various states of restraint. The goal was to assess whether inescapable pain could condition an animal into “learned helplessness,” whereby it simply accepts its fate. Thirty-five years later, the United States government drew inspiration from this experiment in its approach to interrogating terror suspects.\n\nThe plan, conceived by James Mitchell, a psychologist working on contract for the C.I.A., was to induce learned helplessness in humans by combining an individually tailored regimen of torture techniques with environmental manipulation. The techniques—which government documents identify as “omnipotence tactics,” “degradation tactics,” “debilitation tactics,” and “monopolization of perception tactics”—had been developed by Communist forces during the Korean War, to coerce prisoners into making false confessions, for propaganda purposes. Since then, the U.S. military has exposed some élite soldiers to the techniques, to prepare them for the kinds of abuses they might encounter should they be captured by terrorist groups or governments that don’t abide by the Geneva Conventions. Mitchell argued that, by reverse-engineering this program, interrogators could overwhelm whatever resistance training a detainee might have absorbed from the Manchester manual. What followed was a period of experimentation—overseen by psychologists, lawyers, and medical personnel—at C.I.A. black sites and military facilities. In September, 2002, Army officers started referring to Guantánamo as “America’s Battle Lab.”\n\nEarly in the afternoon of October 2, 2002, a group of interagency lawyers and psychologists met to come up with a framework that used “psychological stressors” and environmental manipulation to “foster dependence and compliance.” The C.I.A. had been torturing detainees at black sites for several months; now the Guantánamo leadership wanted to understand the legal gymnastics that would be required to implement a program of their own. “Torture has been prohibited by international law, but the language of the statutes is written vaguely,” Jonathan Fredman, a senior C.I.A. lawyer, said, according to the meeting minutes. “It is basically subject to perception. If the detainee dies, you’re doing it wrong.” (Fredman has disputed the accuracy of the meeting minutes.)\n\nLater that month, a military lawyer named Diane Beaver drafted a legal justification—described later by a congressional inquiry on torture as “profoundly in error and legally insufficient”—for a set of abusive interrogation techniques. Among such methods as forced nakedness, dietary manipulation, daily twenty-hour interrogations, waterboarding, exposure to freezing temperatures, and the withholding of medical care, Beaver endorsed “the use of scenarios designed to convince the detainee that death” was “imminent.” (She later expressed surprise that her legal opinion had become “the final word on interrogation policies and practices within the Department of Defense.”) An accompanying memo, drafted by a military psychologist and a psychiatrist, explained that “all aspects of the environment should enhance capture shock, dislocate expectations, foster dependence, and support exploitation to the fullest extent possible.”\n\nIn November, 2002, the set of proposed techniques landed on Donald Rumsfeld’s desk. He signed it. “Why is standing limited to 4 hours?” he wrote in the margin, referring to a proposed stress position. “I stand for 8-10.”\n\n-=-=-=\n\nBy the spring of 2003, Salahi had been visited in Guantánamo by investigators from Canada and Germany, and questioned by various U.S. government agencies. He had come to think of himself as “a dead camel in the desert, when all kinds of bugs start to eat it.” Most of the interrogations were conducted by the F.B.I., whose questions now centered on establishing a connection between Salahi and 9/11\\. They showed him photos of various hijackers, and one of Ramzi bin al-Shibh, the attack coördinator, who had been captured in Pakistan. “I figured I’ve seen the guy, but where and when?” Salahi wrote in his diary.\n\nEventually, Salahi understood that bin al-Shibh was one of the three men who had stayed at his apartment in Germany for a night, in October, 1999; the other two had become 9/11 hijackers. Now bin al-Shibh, who was being tortured in C.I.A. custody, claimed that Salahi had recruited him into Al Qaeda. “In fact, I’d say, without you, September 11th would never have happened,” one of Salahi’s interrogators told him. Salahi was horrified. “I was, like, Maybe he’s right.” (In fact, the 9/11 plot was organized more than a year before bin al-Shibh visited Duisburg.) For the rest of the interrogation session, he was forced to look at photos of corpses from the aftermath of the attacks.\n\nOn May 22nd, Salahi’s lead F.B.I. interrogator told him that the military would take over his interrogation. “I wish you good luck,” the agent said. “All I can tell you is to tell the truth.” They hugged. The F.B.I. team left Guantánamo, and the torture began.\n\n## Special Projects\n\n> The cell—better, the box—was cooled down to the point that I was shaking most of the time. I was forbidden from seeing the light of the day; every once in a while they gave me a rec-time at night to keep me from seeing or interacting with any detainees. I was living literally in terror. For the next seventy days I wouldn’t know the sweetness of sleeping.\n\n-=-=-=\n\nTwenty-hour interrogations. “You know, when you just fall asleep and the saliva starts to come out of your mouth?” Salahi said. No prayers, no information about the direction of Mecca. No showers for weeks. Force-feeding during the daylight hours of Ramadan, when Muslims are supposed to fast. “We’re gonna feed you up your ass,” an interrogator said.\n\nMedical personnel had noted that Salahi had sciatic-nerve issues; now interrogators kept him in stress positions that exacerbated them. No chairs, no lying down, no more access to his prescription pain medication. “Stand the fuck up!” an interrogator said. But Salahi was shackled to the floor, so he could do so only hunched over. He stayed that way for hours. The next time the Red Cross delegation visited Guantánamo, a representative reported that “medical files are being used by interrogators to gain information in developing an interrogation plan.”\n\nFemale interrogators groped him. They stripped, and rubbed their bodies all over his, and threatened to rape him. “Oh, Allah, help me! Oh, Allah, have mercy on me!” one of them said, mockingly. “Allah! Allah! There is no Allah. He let you down!” An interrogation memo listed plans to shave Salahi’s head and beard, dress him in a burqa, and make him bark and perform dog tricks, “to reduce the detainee’s ego and establish control.”\n\nThe interrogators head-butted him, and made degrading remarks about his religion and his family. They kept him in alternately hot and cold cells, blasted him with strobe lights and heavy-metal music, and poured ice water on him. One day they would deprive him of food, and the next they’d force him to drink water until he vomited. According to interrogation memos, they decorated the walls with photos of genitalia, and set up a baby crib, because he was sensitive about the fact that he had no children.\n\nOn July 17, 2003, a masked interrogator told Salahi that he had dreamed that he saw other detainees digging a grave and tossing a pine casket with Salahi’s detainee number into it. The interrogator added that, if Salahi didn’t start talking, he would be buried on “Christian, sovereign American soil.”\n\nOn August 2nd, military records show, an interrogator told Salahi that he and his colleagues “are sick of hearing the same lies over and over and over and are seriously considering washing their hands of him. Once they do, he will disappear and never be heard from again.” Salahi was told to imagine “the worst possible scenario he could end up in,” and that he would “soon disappear down a very dark hole. His very existence will become erased. His electronic files will be deleted from the computer, his paper files will be packed up. . . . No one will know what happened to him, and eventually, no one will care.”\n\nThat day, the leader of Salahi’s interrogation came in. He identified himself as Captain Collins, a Navy officer who had been sent to Guantánamo by the White House. (His name was actually Richard Zuley; he was a Chicago police detective, working as a military contractor, who has an extensive record of abusing suspects until they confessed to crimes that they hadn’t committed. He did not respond to requests for comment.) Zuley read Salahi a letter, later shown to be forged, stating that his mother was in U.S. custody and might soon be transferred to Guantánamo. According to government records, “the letter referred to ‘the administrative and logistical difficulties her presence would present in this previously all-male prison environment,’ ” implying that she would be raped.\n\n+++inset-left\n[#cartoon: /cartoon/5cb10c4f546f8f3881e5c4a5]||||||\n+++\n\nOn August 13th, Donald Rumsfeld authorized the interrogation plan for Salahi. The document he signed listed one aim of the abuse as to “replicate and exploit the ‘Stockholm Syndrome,’ ” in which kidnapping victims come to trust and feel affection for their captors.\n\nTwelve days later, a group of men charged into Salahi’s cell with a snarling German shepherd. They punched Salahi in the face and the ribs, then covered his eyes with blackout goggles, his ears with earmuffs, and his head with a bag. They tightened the chains on his ankles and wrists, then threw him into the back of a truck, drove to the water, and loaded him into a speedboat. “I thought they were going to execute me,” Salahi wrote.\n\nHe was driven around for three hours, to make him think that he was being transported to a different facility. He was forced to swallow salt water, and, every few minutes, the men packed ice cubes between his clothes and his skin. When the ice melted, they punched him, then repacked the ice to freeze him again. By the end of the boat ride, Salahi was bleeding from his ankles, mouth, and wrists. Seven or eight of his ribs were broken.\n\nBack on land, Salahi was carried to Echo Special, the trailer, which would be his home for several years. For the next month, he was kept in total darkness; his only way of knowing day from night was to look into the toilet and see if there was brightness at the end of the drain. “To be honest I can report very little about the next couple of weeks,” Salahi wrote, “because I was not in the right state of mind.”\n\nSoon afterward, an interrogator e-mailed Diane Zierhoffer, a military psychologist, with concerns about Salahi’s mental health. “Slahi told me he is ‘hearing voices’ now,” the interrogator wrote. “Is this something that happens to people who have little external stimulus such as daylight, human interaction etc???? Seems a little creepy.”\n\n“Sensory deprivation can cause hallucinations, usually visual rather than auditory, but you never know,” Zierhoffer replied. “In the dark you create things out of what little you have.”\n\n-=-=-=\n\n“Had I done what they accused me of, I would have relieved myself on day one,” Salahi wrote in his diary. “But the problem is that you cannot just admit to something you haven’t done; you need to deliver the details, which you can’t when you hadn’t done anything. It’s not just, ‘Yes, I did!’ No, it doesn’t work that way: you have to make up a complete story that makes sense to the dumbest dummies. One of the hardest things to do is to tell an untruthful story and maintain it, and that is exactly where I was stuck.”\n\nOn September 8th, Salahi asked to speak to Zuley. By now, he had enough information about the kind of story he had to craft, because, he wrote, “through my conversations with the FBI and the DoD, I had a good idea as to what wild theories the government had about me.”\n\nZuley walked in, and Salahi started lying. But it wasn’t enough; the government wanted him to link other people in Canada to various plots. Salahi figured that this was how bin al-Shibh had ended up naming him as a high-level Al Qaeda recruiter. He recalled, “I took the pen and paper and wrote all kinds of incriminating lies about a poor person who was just seeking refuge in Canada and trying to make some money so he could start a family. Moreover, he is handicapped. I felt so bad, and kept praying silently, ‘Nothing’s gonna happen to you dear brother.’ ”\n\nThe abuse wound down slowly—no more hitting, but no “comfort items,” either, and no uninterrupted periods of rest. James Mitchell, the C.I.A. contract psychologist who devised the enhanced-interrogation program, describes this period as an element of “Pavlovian conditioning,” in which the detainee sees his situation improve or deteriorate in direct accordance with his level of compliance.\n\nOne day, Zuley walked into Salahi’s cell, carrying a pillow. In time, he was given back his pain medication. Then he was prescribed antidepressants.\n\nIn mid-November, Salahi voluntarily sat for a polygraph test. The examiner described Salahi, whose answers contradicted everything he had confessed to Zuley in the preceding weeks, as “eager to prove that he is providing accurate information.” The results were decisive: “No deception indicated.”\n\n-=-=-=\n\nOn February 14, 2004, Salahi received a short letter from his mother in Mauritania, informing him that her “health situation is OK.” It had been eight hundred and fifteen days since he had seen her—an ailing woman in the rearview mirror, waving from the street as he drove to Deddahi Abdellahi’s intelligence headquarters. In all this time, his family had had no official confirmation of his whereabouts. Salahi’s brother, who is a German citizen, had read in _Der Spiegel_ that he was in Guantánamo, but Abdellahi insisted that it wasn’t true—that he was looking after Salahi in a Mauritanian prison. Meanwhile, his subordinates continued to collect bribes from Salahi’s family.\n\nMohamed Elmoustapha Ould Badre Eddine, a left-wing member of the Mauritanian Parliament, conducted inquiries of his own, but made no progress. Badre Eddine had spent some four decades organizing grassroots campaigns against the practice of slavery and other human-rights violations, and for this he had spent years in remote detention sites, under a succession of authoritarian regimes. Throughout 2002 and 2003, whenever the foreign minister visited the parliamentary chamber, Badre Eddine demanded to know Salahi’s whereabouts. Each time, the minister lied—even after the Red Cross had started delivering Salahi’s letters from Guantánamo to his family.\n\nIn 2005, Mauritania had a military coup—the typical way in which power has changed hands since independence. “Each government claims that it has come to the rescue of the population, which had been neglected and abused by the previous government,” Badre Eddine told me. “And then it behaves the same way as the last.” When he asked the new regime about Salahi, he said, “they just replied, ‘We didn’t kidnap him—it was the previous government that did it. And now he belongs to the Americans.’ ”\n\nFrom the floor of Parliament, Badre Eddine noted that Mauritania has no extradition treaty with the United States. “He was a victim of an extremely rare crime: that a country had kidnapped its own citizen and handed it over to a foreign country, outside of the justice system, outside of all legal processes,” Brahim Ebety, the Salahi family’s lawyer in Nouakchott, told me. Under the new regime, Abdellahi, the spy chief, was demoted, and given the task of investigating corruption and malfeasance within the security services; the standard path for accountability required Abdellahi to investigate himself.\n\n-=-=-=\n\nSteve Wood walked into Echo Special in the spring of 2004 unaware of everything that had happened before. His was the first guard force that didn’t wear masks, that allowed Salahi to pray. Outside of the political discussions, he and Salahi passed the hours playing rummy, Risk, and chess. When Salahi’s female interrogators came in for a game of Monopoly, Salahi always threw the match. “My interest is not to be tortured,” he said. “And Steve’s interest is to impress the girls. So, completely different goals in life.”\n\nSometimes Wood opened Salahi’s Quran to a random page and told him the verse number, and Salahi would recite it aloud from memory, first in Arabic, then in English. It was the first time Wood had encountered the Quran. He wanted to ask Salahi more about its contents, but he suspected that there were microphones and cameras in the cell. Outside Echo Special, Wood started reading about Guantánamo on activist Web sites, but a colleague warned him that Internet traffic was monitored on the base. He began to worry that awareness among his co-workers of his increasingly complex feelings toward Salahi might elicit accusations that he was unpatriotic, or an insider threat. “I tried to make my time there morally neutral, without being called a traitor,” he told me. “I was scared to ask too many questions, I was scared to read a book on Islam while I was in there, or show too much interest.”\n\n+++inset-left\n[#cartoon: /cartoon/5cb10c4feacf5a2e3227036c]||||||\n+++\n\nWood’s concerns were not unjustified. While Salahi was being tortured, James Yee, the Muslim military chaplain, discovered that he and the interpreters at Guantánamo—many of whom were Muslim Americans, with Middle Eastern backgrounds—were being spied on by law-enforcement and intelligence officers. When Yee went on leave, he flew to Jacksonville, Florida, where he was interrogated and arrested, then blindfolded, earmuffed, and driven to a Navy brig in South Carolina. For seventy-six days, he lived in solitary confinement, in a cold cell with surveillance cameras and the lights always on. Government officials suggested that Yee was running an elaborate spy ring—that he and other Muslims had “infiltrated” the military, and represented the gravest insider threat since the Cold War. Based on a misreading of materials in his possession, and the vague aspersions of Islamophobic military officers, prosecutors accused him of treason and “aiding the enemy,” and threatened to pursue the death penalty. (All charges were later dropped, and Yee was honorably discharged.)\n\nIn October, 2004, Wood’s girlfriend gave birth to a daughter, Summer. Seven months later, his deployment ended. Before leaving Guantánamo, he gave Salahi a novel by Steve Martin, “The Pleasure of My Company.” “Pillow, good luck with your situation,” he wrote inside. “Just remember Allah always has a plan. I hope you think of us as more than just guards. I think we all became friends.” But he wasn’t sure that Salahi believed him. “The whole time I was thinking, you know, What does he really think of us?” he recalled. “What if he is, like, ‘I hate these sons of bitches for locking me up’? And Mohamedou probably thought I was thinking the same thing—that, to me, he was just a job, and nothing more.” So, during one of his final shifts, Wood broke protocol and showed Salahi a photo of Summer. “It was my way of telling him, ‘Man, I trust you. This is my daughter. She is my life. This friendship is real.’ ”\n\nSalahi saw no path out of Guantánamo. Even if the military believed he was innocent, he figured that he knew too much about classified torture programs to be let out into the world. By the time Wood left, he had come to accept his guards and interrogators as family. “True, you didn’t choose this family, nor did you grow up with it, but it’s a family all the same,” he wrote in his diary. “Every time a good member of my present family leaves it feels as if a piece of my heart is being chopped off.”\n\nHe often turned to a verse by the Iraqi poet Ahmed Matar:\n\n> I stood in my cell  \n> Wondering about my situation  \n> Am I the prisoner, or is it that guard standing nearby?  \n> Between me and him stood a wall  \n> In the wall, there was a hole  \n> Through which I see light, and he sees darkness  \n> Just like me he has a wife, kids, a house  \n> Just like me he came here on orders from above.  \n\nHaving accepted his guards, Salahi wrote, the next phase of captivity was “getting used to the prison, and being afraid of the outside world.”\n\n## The Outside World\n\n-=-=-=\n\nA year in Echo Special shattered Wood’s ideas about his post-military future. Before his deployment, he had aspired to become a police officer. “But I changed my mind after Guantánamo,” he told me. He wanted no part of a system in which he might have control over another person’s liberty. “I don’t like power,” he said. He left the Oregon National Guard, and started working night shifts at a twenty-four-hour gym near Portland. Few people worked out at two or three in the morning, so he had plenty of time to continue his self-education on global affairs. He started in on the books he had been too afraid to request in Guantánamo—ones about Islam.\n\nWood had come to see Islam in much the same way that many of the detainees did: as the only thing that couldn’t be stripped from them. The devotion, the routine of the five daily prayers—“that kept Mohamedou going,” Wood told me. Now, as he read, “I saw how beautiful the religion was,” he said. On most days, he searched Salahi’s name online, hoping to learn more about the case, and to make sense of his own deployment to Echo Special, to no avail. He found it almost impossible to reconcile the news coverage of Guantánamo Bay with what he had witnessed there. As he read about Islamic history, he began to seek clarity in the Quran itself.\n\nIn 2006, Wood removed his shoes at the entrance to the Masjid As-Saber, Portland’s largest mosque. He wasn’t sure what he wanted out of the visit—he knew only that curiosity eclipsed his misgivings. During the next few months, Wood showed up between prayer times, to avoid any pressure to participate. On his third visit, he told two Saudi students that he wanted to become a Muslim. Conversion to Islam requires only that, in the presence of Muslim witnesses, you declare the Shahada—“There is no God but God, and Muhammad is his prophet”—and that you believe it in your heart. The students acted as Wood’s witnesses.\n\nWood started sporadically attending prayers. An elderly white convert warned him to avoid a couple of other white converts, who dressed in religious clothing and talked about wanting to participate in the jihad. When Wood told the old man that he had worked at Guantánamo Bay, the man suggested that he keep it to himself. Soon afterward, Wood learned that the imam, a Somali immigrant who practiced a conservative strain of Islam known as Salafism, had been the subject of F.B.I. investigations and was on a no-fly list, and that several men who had attended the Masjid As-Saber had been convicted on terrorism charges. “So that scared me away,” he said. He stopped praying in public. “I just wanted this to be me and God.”\n\nBy now, Wood was no longer dating Summer’s mother. In 2008, he met a woman named Wendy at a bar. They married in 2010, and had a child six years later. He never told Wendy about his conversion.\n\n-=-=-=\n\nThe United States leases the land beneath the Guantánamo Bay detention facility from Cuba, for four thousand and eighty-five dollars a year, under an agreement signed after the Spanish-American War. (For the past sixty years, the Cuban government has sought to nullify the agreement, and it refuses to cash the checks.) Because detainees are not in U.S. territory, the government has not allowed them to be tried in U.S. courts. Instead, they are tried by secret military commissions—if they are tried at all. More detainees have died at Guantánamo than have been convicted of a crime.\n\nThe prosecutor assigned to Salahi’s case was a lieutenant colonel named Stuart Couch, who had retired from the military before 9/11\\. A close friend of his had been the co-pilot of one of the planes that was flown into the World Trade Center, and Couch told the _Wall Street Journal_ that he had reënlisted because he wanted “to get a crack at the guys who attacked the United States.” When he saw the government’s file on Salahi, he considered pursuing the death penalty.\n\nCouch never met Salahi, but, while Zuley was torturing him, Couch received summaries of each new confession. In late 2003—a period that Salahi described in a letter as “where my brake broke loose”—Couch struggled to keep up with the constant stream of information. In time, he became suspicious that Salahi’s confessions had been elicited through torture, and were therefore tainted evidence. When he discovered the forged letter from Zuley’s team, saying that the United States had captured Salahi’s mother, he resigned from the case.\n\nIn June, 2004, the Supreme Court ruled that Guantánamo detainees could challenge the grounds for their detention. It became fashionable for high-profile corporate-law firms to represent Guantánamo clients, pro bono, but many detainees rejected representation, because they thought it was a ploy to lend legitimacy to an unjust detention. Defense attorneys have accused the government of denying them access to evidence, leaving secret recording equipment in client meeting rooms, and infiltrating their legal teams; a few years ago, Ramzi bin al-Shibh, who may face the death penalty, recognized a linguist on his own defense team from a C.I.A. black site.\n\nWhen Salahi’s lawyers wrote to him, asking that he inform them of everything he had told the government, he wrote back, “Are you out of your mind! How can I render uninterrupted interrogation that has been lasting the last 7 years. That’s like asking Charlie Sheen how many women he dated.” The important stuff was in his diary, he said, which they could read only inside a secure facility near Washington, D.C.\n\nIn the military hearing, Salahi described the torture program in vivid detail. The transcript omits much of his testimony, noting that, at the moment he started to describe the abuse, “the recording equipment began to malfunction” and that the tapes were “distorted.” The transcript continues, “The Detainee wanted to show the Board his scars and location of injuries, but the board declined the viewing.” (By now, the U.S. government was rolling back authorizations for torture techniques, and the military and the C.I.A. were entering a period of self-reflection; during the next several years, internal and congressional investigations would expose many of the worst abuses that had been inflicted on Salahi and other men in custody.)\n\nThe government no longer attempted to prosecute Salahi—nobody had touched the criminal case since Couch withdrew—but it argued that he should nevertheless be detained indefinitely. On March 22, 2010, a U.S. district-court judge named James Robertson ruled on Salahi’s petition to be released. “The government’s case, essentially, is that Salahi was so connected to al-Qaida for a decade beginning in 1990 that he must have been ‘part of’ al-Qaida at the time of his capture,” Robertson wrote. But the government had “abandoned the theory” that Salahi knew about 9/11 before it happened. As for his jihadi connections, Robertson continued, the government’s classified filings “tend to support Salahi’s submission that he was attempting to find the appropriate balance—avoiding close relationships with al-Qaida members, but also trying to avoid making himself an enemy” of the group. In Robertson’s assessment, the government’s evidence about Salahi was “so attenuated, or so tainted by coercion and mistreatment, or so classified, that it cannot support a successful criminal prosecution.” He concluded, “Salahi must be released from custody.”\n\nSteve Wood was elated when he heard the news. But the government appealed, and Salahi stayed in Guantánamo. Wood contacted one of Salahi’s lawyers, using a made-up name and a new e-mail address, to inquire about Salahi’s well-being and the status of his case. But he subsequently forgot the log-in information, and so he never saw a reply. A couple of years later, he considered visiting Mauritania, to track down Salahi’s family and apologize for his role in Salahi’s detention. He no longer derived much solace from Islam, and rarely prayed. The decision to keep his conversion a secret from everyone in his life made him feel at times as if being Muslim were wrong, even though, in his heart, he still believed.\n\nIn 2012, Salahi’s lawyers won a seven-year legal battle to declassify his diary. Government censors redacted names, dates, locations, and other sensitive or embarrassing information. When they finished, Salahi’s lawyers delivered a CD-*rom*{: .small} with the scanned pages to Larry Siems, a writer and a human-rights advocate, who has written extensively on government misconduct in the aftermath of 9/11\\. “There was a really profound sense of responsibility and ethical risk which came with editing the manuscript of someone who was alive but unable to participate in that process,” Siems told me. “I petitioned the Defense Department to allow me to show him the edited manuscript, but they turned me down.” In 2015, it was published, by Little, Brown, as “Guantánamo Diary.”\n\nSoon afterward, in Guantánamo Bay, Salahi saw his own face on a TV screen. Siems was doing an interview about the diary, and in that moment Salahi finally felt as if he was beginning to take back the narrative of his life. “My cell expanded, the lights became brighter, colors more colorful, the sun shone warmer and gentler, and everyone around me looked friendlier,” he wrote.\n\nAnother year passed. Every time there was a hurricane warning in Guantánamo Bay, Salahi dreamed that the storm had wiped away the prison camp, and everyone, detainees and captors alike, was “fighting side by side to survive,” he wrote. “In some versions I saved many lives, in others I was saved, but somehow we all managed to escape, unharmed and free.”\n\nWood reconnected with Salahi’s lawyers, this time using his real name. When he learned that a military review board would consider releasing Salahi, he wrote a letter saying that, “based on my interactions with Mr. Slahi in Guantánamo, I would be pleased to welcome him into my home,” and offering to testify in person. He also contacted another guard from Echo Special. According to Wood, the guard drafted a note, but he decided not to submit it. “All his friends and family knew him as the guy who was guarding a high-value detainee, and really proud of it,” Wood told me. “His whole reputation rested on this fiction. But, after the diary came out, they learned that Mohamedou is not high value, he’s just a guy who got fucked over for years.” He added, “Guantánamo has a long shadow for everyone—not just the detainees.”\n\n-=-=-=\n\nOne night in October, 2016, Wood’s phone rang while he was in a Safeway in Portland. On the other end of the line was a man whose voice he hadn’t heard in more than eleven years. Salahi told him that he was now home. So much had changed since he had been taken into custody, more than fifty-four hundred days earlier. His mother was dead, and so was one of his brothers, but there were teen-age nieces and nephews whom he was meeting for the first time. The proceeds from his book were paying for a niece’s studies in Dubai and a nephew’s master’s degree in applied mathematics at a university in Kuala Lumpur. Salahi told Wood that he had written four more books in detention, but he hadn’t been allowed to take them out of Guantánamo. One was a self-help book about finding happiness in a hopeless place.\n\nWood told Salahi that he was working for his brother’s construction company, repairing bridges. The hours were unpredictable, with long drives and arduous shifts. As at Guantánamo, he often worked at night. But he derived immense satisfaction from the work, and saw in it the kind of moral clarity that Guantánamo had lacked. When I visited Wood, last August, he and his team were layering the surface of a bridge near Dayton, Oregon, with epoxy, rocks, and primer. “The point is to pave, seal, and waterproof it, to preserve its lifespan,” he said. We got to the site at sunrise; the sky was a hazy, muted orange, from wildfires burning to the south. “It takes a lot of prep to start the job, but, when you’ve done your bit, you’re leaving things better than when you arrived,” he said.\n\nSalahi’s freedom became a strain on Wood’s marriage. Wood became secretive about his calls with Salahi; Wendy began to suspect that he was having an affair. When Wood agreed to talk about Salahi for a TV documentary, Wendy’s parents staged an intervention. “They said I was bringing shame upon the family, and protecting a terrorist,” Wood recalled. When he refused to back out of the interview, Wendy insisted that he wear an on-camera disguise. She told me that she thought he was doing something really dangerous—that people might think Steve was sympathetic to someone who was involved in 9/11, and go after him, her, and their baby daughter. Soon afterward, Steve and Wendy separated.\n\nLast May, one of Salahi’s cousins posted a note on Facebook that referred to Wood’s conversion. When Wendy saw the post, she was outraged—but also somewhat relieved, since it partly explained his secretive behavior. “And I didn’t confirm or deny anything,” Wood told me. “I just kind of shrugged it off, like, What does it matter?” They decided to get a divorce. When I visited their house, a real-estate agent had removed all the family photographs and replaced them with catalogue art, to make it easier for prospective buyers to think of the house as a blank slate.\n\n## Dissonance\n\n-=-=-=\n\nLarry Siems visited Salahi in Mauritania, and they set about filling in the redactions in the book. In the first edition of “Guantánamo Diary,” Siems had included an author’s note:\n\n> In a recent conversation with one of his lawyers, Mohamedou said that he holds no grudge against any of the people he mentions in this book, that he appeals to them to read it and correct it if they think it contains any errors, and that he dreams to one day sit with all of them around a cup of tea, after having learned so much from one another.\n\nIn the restored edition, Salahi added, “I want to repeat and affirm this message here, and to say that now that I am home, that dream is also an invitation. The doors of my house are open.”\n\nThis winter, Steve Wood set off for Mauritania. The journey to Nouakchott took almost three days, with long layovers in New York and Casablanca. Mauritanian immigration officials detained him for an hour—here was a giant American, all muscle and veins, saying that he had met Salahi in Guantánamo Bay—but eventually one of Salahi’s nephews persuaded them to let Wood in.\n\nNear the airport parking lot, Salahi stood in a light-blue boubou, the traditional Mauritanian robe, with a turban to obscure his identity. “Bet you’ll think twice next time about saying you know me,” he said, laughing. As they walked to the car, Salahi dug into Wood’s personal life. “Man, you’ve had a really tough time of it,” he said. “Like, really stressful.” They slept under mosquito nets in Salahi’s bedroom, and woke up to the sound of a bleating sheep. Salahi noted that “Steve snores like—how do you call it?—a steam train.”\n\n+++feature-small\n[#image: /photos/5cb10c51fc1f8c3868bc21ae]|||\n|||\n+++\n\nIt was January 11, 2019—exactly seventeen years since the first detainees had arrived at Guantánamo Bay. (Forty people remain in the camp, at an annual cost of some ten million dollars a detainee.) Salahi had spent the morning reviewing a speech he had prepared for events hosted by Amnesty International and Physicians for Human Rights. In the two and a half years since his return, he has received several professional visitors—Siems, his lawyers, and the filmmaker Michael Bronner, who is adapting Salahi’s diary—and also personal visits from a lawyer, whom I’ll call Amanda. “We met like any decent person these days—on social media,” Salahi said. After she converted to Islam, they married in a religious ceremony. Now, in a phone call, Amanda suggested edits for Salahi’s speech—that he take out “lynching,” for example, and make his remarks more “gracious”—and Salahi accepted all of them.\n\nSalahi and Wood sat in front of a laptop, with the Webcam on, and Skyped into a room in Washington. “Everything that happened to me—everything I witnessed in Guantánamo Bay—happened in the name of democracy, in the name of security, in the name of the American people,” Salahi told the audience at the Amnesty event. He added that, as the world’s most powerful democracy, the United States had “the means to uphold and pressure other countries to uphold human rights. But instead the United States is stating to the world very clear and loud that democracy does not work—that when you need to get down and dirty, you need a dictatorship. That dictatorship was built in Guantánamo Bay.”\n\n+++inset-left\n[#cartoon: /cartoon/5cb10c4f50ffa55060e8fa5c]||||||\n+++\n\nIn 2014, Salahi collapsed in his cell and was rushed to an operating room for emergency gallbladder surgery. But the procedure wasn’t carried out properly—he continued to be in pain—and by the summer of 2016 it was clear that he required corrective laparoscopic surgery. Military doctors offered to take care of it, but Salahi declined; his release date was only a couple of months away, and he wanted to get the surgery on his own terms, once he was free. Mauritanian hospitals don’t have the capacity—they typically send such patients to France—but what Salahi didn’t know was that his repatriation would not amount to the restitution of his rights. According to a senior U.S. diplomat, when the United States was negotiating the terms of his return, “the Mauritanians did agree that they would not give him a passport for some _x_ amount of time.” Two and a half years later, Salahi and his lawyers have no clarity about the parameters of “_x_,” or about why the United States has any say in whether the Mauritanian government issues a passport to a Mauritanian.\n\nIn addition to Salahi’s abdominal pain, and regular migraines, he still suffers from night terrors. He often wakes up shaking, crying, and grinding his teeth. A private hospital in Germany has offered to cover the costs of Salahi’s gallbladder surgery, plus a year of physical and psychological rehabilitation, but without a passport he cannot travel to Europe. “I am denied my freedom because I was denied my freedom,” Salahi said. “A lot of wise people tell me, ‘Mohamedou, shut the fuck up, don’t ask for papers, don’t ask. Mauritania is much bigger than Guantánamo Bay—you can move around.’ But I insist on freedom.”\n\nAnother liberty Salahi identified as having been taken from him is that of expressing the full range of human feelings. “If you say that you are angry, it is understood as an emotion,” he said. “If I say that I am angry, it is seen as a threat to national security.”\n\n-=-=-=\n\nThe next day, Salahi brought Wood and me to a friend’s wedding party, hosted by Mauritania’s best radiologist. As we walked to the house, Abu Hafs al-Mauritani came out of a nearby mosque, dressed in a white turban and long robes. “_Assalaamu alaikum_,” he said to Mohamedou. “Peace be upon you.” They shook hands. Then Abu Hafs greeted Wood, who, appearing paralyzed by confusion, coldly took his hand. Abu Hafs walked into the house ahead of us, and disappeared into the crowd. Salahi generally avoids Abu Hafs—they have fundamentally different views of Islam, and he worries that any association could further complicate his life. (Until 2007, a terrorist sanctions list included Salahi’s name as an alias for Abu Hafs.)\n\nIt was a grand compound, white stone decorated with lavish carpets and chandeliers. The anteroom was filled with Mauritanian dignitaries and élites, all men, sitting on couches that lined the perimeter. Salahi and Wood went around the room shaking hands with bankers, merchants, prefects, doctors. There was a famous Mauritanian poet named Taki, the former minister of communications, the current Mauritanian Ambassador to Saudi Arabia.\n\nSalahi and I sat on either side of the leader of a political party that has more than a hundred and fifty seats in Parliament. He was a tall, regal businessman, and wore Ted Baker sunglasses and a Rolex. During a lull in conversation, he turned to Salahi and, gesturing toward Wood and me, said, “So, you studied in the United States?”\n\n“No, I’m an ex-prisoner of Guantánamo Bay,” Salahi replied, instantly ending the conversation.\n\nAfter lunch, I stood in the reception area, watching Mauritanian politicians and tribal leaders kiss Abu Hafs on both cheeks and thank him for coming. A former leader of several provinces explained to me that Abu Hafs, bin Laden’s former Sharia adviser, is now an adviser to the President.\n\nThe next day, Abu Hafs invited me to his house, in one of Nouakchott’s most expensive neighborhoods. Until recently, the former spy chief Deddahi Ould Abdellahi lived directly across the street. I arrived just before the sunset prayers. Thirty or forty of Abu Hafs’s followers filled a small wooden shack next to his home, spilling into the street, while he led prayers through a microphone. It was a temporary facility, he explained, while he raises money to build a mosque.\n\nAfter the prayer session, Abu Hafs led me into his living room, and for four hours he detailed his falling-out with bin Laden, his whereabouts and activities in the aftermath of 9/11, and his relationship with Mauritania’s President. “It’s not a formal position—there is no contract,” he said. “But I give him advice, and he takes it.”\n\nMauritania was the site of regular jihadi violence in the second half of the aughts, while Abu Hafs was living in Iran. But it stopped abruptly after a failed assassination attempt against the President, in 2011, which raised questions about whether he was cutting deals with Al Qaeda. That May, U.S. Navy *Seal*{: .small}s killed bin Laden, and collected more than a million documents from his compound in northern Pakistan; among them was a letter from Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, seeking the central leadership’s blessing to enter into a “secret agreement” with the Mauritanian government. “The Mujahideen are committed to not carry out any military activity in Mauritania,” the letter says—as long as the Mauritanian government released imprisoned fighters, abstained from attacking Al Qaeda cells abroad, and paid the group between ten and twenty million euros per year, “to compensate and prevent the kidnapping of tourists.” (The Mauritanian government has denied that it negotiates with terrorist groups.)\n\nAround that time, Abu Hafs explained, it became clear to him that the Mauritanian President would be open to his return from Iran. He and his family had spent almost ten years under the protection of the Revolutionary Guard, but, with talk of the Obama Administration’s thaw in relations with Iran, Abu Hafs began to worry that he could be traded into U.S. custody. His wife and children left first; once they had settled in Nouakchott, Abu Hafs said, the challenge was to transport himself thousands of miles without being detected, arrested, or subjected to rendition.\n\nOne day in the spring of 2012, Abu Hafs slipped out of custody during a visit to the gym. He bolted through the changing room and into the street, dressed in his gym clothes, and hailed a taxi to the Mauritanian Embassy in Tehran. The Ambassador called Nouakchott, and the foreign minister ordered the Embassy to fabricate a passport, using a fake name.\n\nWhen the documents were complete, Abu Hafs said, the Mauritanian government booked him on a commercial route that connected through three countries. The Ambassador drove him to Tehran’s international airport in a diplomatic vehicle, and accompanied him through the diplomatic channel, through airport security and immigration, right up until the moment he got on the plane.\n\nAbu Hafs wouldn’t say which countries he had travelled through—only that, in the first two, the Mauritanian Ambassador met him on the tarmac, walked him through the airport, and stayed with him until he got on the next plane. In the third country, the Mauritanian foreign minister greeted Abu Hafs, and accompanied him on the flight to Nouakchott. There, Abu Hafs spent two months in custody, as a formality.\n\nWhen I shared Abu Hafs’s account of his return with the senior U.S. diplomat, she replied, “It’s the first I’m hearing any of it.” The Mauritanians didn’t inform the United States of his return until “probably weeks later,” she said. “There was no fanfare, no announcement.” The Americans learned only that, “as a condition for return, he agreed that he would renounce his former association and embark on a message of denouncing terrorism and preaching a more tolerant and pacifist message.” I asked whether the United States, after learning of his return, had sought to detain or rendition him. “What would we tell the Mauritanians?” the diplomat replied. “It’s their citizen, and it’s their country.”\n\nThe lesson seemed to be that the right mix of atonement and seniority in a terrorist organization can give the kind of leverage that is unavailable to men like Salahi. I asked Abu Hafs to tell me the name printed in his diplomatic passport, assuming that the identity was no longer valid. He refused, saying that he didn’t want to jeopardize his future travel.\n\n-=-=-=\n\nWood stayed with Salahi for four days. They prayed together, ate together, and enjoyed a picnic of bread and tea in the dunes of the Sahara. One day, they had coffee at a hotel, by the pool, with the legal team of a current Guantánamo detainee. Soon afterward, in a room at the same hotel, the U.S. State Department hosted a training session for Mauritania’s security-intelligence apparatus, on “Interdiction of Terrorist Activities.” Salahi suffered night terrors, and Wood suffered a splitting headache from caffeine withdrawal. “Out here, I’m probably only drinking seven or eight coffees per day,” he told me. (During the layover in Casablanca, he had drunk a Red Bull and twenty-two shots of espresso.) Salahi handed him some leftover ibuprofen from the Guantánamo pharmacy.\n\nFor Wood, the trip became something more complicated than a visit to a friend. Salahi was on a publicity campaign, to draw attention to the injustice of his withheld passport, and at times it seemed to Wood as if he were a prop—the former guard who recognized Salahi’s innocence. TV crews were present at meals, and an interviewer showed up at Salahi’s apartment, recorder in hand, and asked Wood, who still hadn’t told his brothers that he is a Muslim, to comment on his favorite Quranic passages, and to share his thoughts on the legacy of the Prophet Muhammad. Wood complied—he felt that it was the least he could do for Salahi. During the Amnesty International live stream, someone on Twitter commented that, of the two of them, Wood looked like the detainee.\n\nAnother dissonance was that Salahi’s eloquent orations on fundamental human rights stopped short of confronting a reality that Wood noticed on the second day: as guests of Mauritanian élites, they were served lavish meals by people who appeared to be slaves. Although slavery was criminalized in 2007, Mauritanian human-rights advocates told me that the law was drafted to appease international organizations—that virtually nothing has changed. At an event, I exchanged phone numbers with an extremely submissive server who was dressed in ragged clothes and had a cloudy, damaged eye. The host, who was a government official, grew agitated, pulled me aside, and urged me not to mention that I had ever been to his house. “And, by the way, I pay my boy,” he added, unprompted.\n\nI tried to press the topic with Salahi, but it was as if his transfer from Guantánamo had carried with it a kind of transposition of restraint, from shackles to self-policing. In 2005, during the military hearing, Salahi had urged the presiding officer not to send him back to Mauritania. “I want to go to a country where I can enjoy my freedom,” he said.\n\nWood left for the airport at 4 *A.M*{: .small}. Salahi spent much of the day watching YouTube compilations of the worst “American Idol” auditions. “It’s so empty, now that Steve left,” he said to me. “So empty.”\n\nIn recent months, the push for Salahi’s passport has taken on new urgency. Amanda, who lives in Europe, was pregnant, and Salahi would miss the birth of his son. “Did you see what Steve brought me?” Salahi said, pointing to some baby clothes. “They look like a prison uniform with stripes! I think he still sees any baby in my family as a future inmate.” Brahim Ebety, Salahi’s Mauritanian lawyer, told me that he is considering a lawsuit against the Mauritanian government. “At the beginning, Mohamedou wanted to be docile and sweet,” he said. “But with these people you cannot be likable. You must be very tough. You must forget your fear to achieve anything.”\n\nLast summer, Salahi completed an online course to become a certified life coach. He now has two American clients, whom he helps to navigate personal and professional woes through weekly Skype meetings. “I want to ask you a favor, if it is O.K. with you, and that is to tell me five things that you are grateful for today,” he told one of them. Sometimes the sessions veer into his own coping mechanisms—the routines he made up to fill his days in Guantánamo, for example, “when we had nothing to look forward to except the world we created inside my cell.”\n\nEarlier this month, Amanda gave birth to a son. They named him Ahmed, and Salahi asked Wood to be the godfather. “There are so many Ahmeds that it’ll be difficult for them to put him on the no-fly list,” Salahi joked. On paper, Salahi is not listed as the father. But Amanda is an American, and so their son is now a citizen of the country whose purported values Salahi wants to believe in but has never seen. ♦\n\nAn earlier version of this story misidentified Canada’s Security Intelligence Service.\n\n","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1ef841e4c73c088d79ae","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Detainees","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"detainees"},{"id":"5c2e1cb24a08312cd3aa6c87","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Prisoners","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"prisoners"}],"sections":[{"id":"5907ef12019dfc3494e9c8f2","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"A Reporter at Large","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"a-reporter-at-large"}]},"channel":"Magazine","contentSource":"magazine","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"5910a8464e65be2f29d55e8b","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Ben Taub joined *The New Yorker* as a staff writer in 2017.

Officers whisked in one person after another to stand before the judge; all of them had been arrested within the past twenty-four hours, and all appeared dishevelled and exhausted. One older man had on a sleeveless black T-shirt that read “*BE FREE*{:.small}”; a young man wore a hospital bracelet and gown, his back bare except where the gown was tied together. Many of their alleged offenses were relatively minor—harassment, misdemeanor assault—and the judge set most of them free. But, in cases where bail was set, the accused were taken to a holding cell in the back, where they waited to be bailed out—or taken to jail.\n\nWhenever prosecutors asked the judge to set bail, they would say, “The People request a thousand-dollar bail,” or a “ten-thousand-dollar bail,” or another dollar amount. It was always “the People” because the District Attorney—and the prosecutors who work in the D.A.’s office—theoretically represent the people of Queens. But, over the past several months, the campaign for the borough’s next D.A. has prompted a vigorous debate over what exactly “the People” want, transforming a seemingly obscure political contest into a national story. Tuesday was the Democratic primary for D.A., but the only sign in this courtroom that change was coming was a sticker one public defender wore that read “I voted!”\n\nFor twenty-eight years, a Democrat named Richard Brown held the position of Queens District Attorney, maintaining a tough-on-crime approach from an earlier era of urban law enforcement. The borough became known as the city’s “[misdemeanor incarceration capital](https://council.nyc.gov/rory-lancman/2019/05/03/data-confirms-queens-is-the-misdemeanor-incarceration-capital-of-new-york-city/),” because so many people accused of misdemeanors were sent to jail. As a new wave of “progressive prosecutors” has taken office across the country, the seven candidates who entered the race to succeed Brown debated the question of how the office should be reformed. Melinda Katz, the Queens borough president, who was considered the front-runner, embraced many progressive reforms, but Tiffany Cabán, a thirty-one-year-old public defender, proposed the most sweeping changes. She pledged to stop prosecuting many crimes (including sex work, trespassing, and disorderly conduct) and to eliminate cash bail. She eschewed the term “progressive prosecutor” in favor of another term: “decarceral prosecutor.”\n\n[Cabán announced her candidacy](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/tiffany-caban-the-public-defender-running-for-queens-district-attorney-and-her-feminist-coalition) in January, won the endorsement of the New York City chapter of the Democratic Socialists of America, and, in April, secured the endorsement of the Working Families Party, which paid for a campaign manager and other staffers. She was considered a long-shot candidate, though, until a moment in late May when [Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/07/23/alexandria-ocasio-cortezs-historic-win-and-the-future-of-the-democratic-party), the congresswoman whose upset victory last fall stunned the Queens Democratic establishment, endorsed her, asking her own supporters to send in three-dollar contributions. On June 6th, [Larry Krasner](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/10/29/larry-krasners-campaign-to-end-mass-incarceration), the Philadelphia D.A., who has received national attention for his reform efforts, came to Queens to announce his support. [The New York *Times* endorsed Cabán](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/18/opinion/tiffany-caban-times-endorsement.html) on June 18th, and, the next day, Senator Elizabeth Warren and Senator Bernie Sanders followed suit. Cabán already had some three hundred volunteers, but, in the four days leading up to the primary, that number rose to fourteen hundred. Her last-minute donors included Laurene Powell Jobs, who gave five thousand dollars  the day before the election. The campaign ran commercials on cable television and advertised on sidewalk kiosks across the borough, particularly in western Queens, where Ocasio-Cortez had prevailed.\n\nOn the morning of Election Day, Cabán went to a polling place near her home, in Astoria, with two close friends, Divya Sundaram and Stephanie Silkowski, who had convinced her to run, eight months earlier. Later that night, they headed to her Election Night watch party, at a night club in Woodside called La Boom, which calls itself the city’s “#1 Latin Dance Party.” More than  seven hundred people showed up. There was Krasner, who had travelled from Philadelphia with a security detail—two plainclothes police officers—in his red Tesla. There was Alex Vitale, a Brooklyn College professor and the author of “The End of Policing,” who had brought along a friend, a judge from Texas named Franklin Bynum. (Last year, Bynum was one of two D.S.A. members who won judgeships in Houston. If Cabán won, Bynum declared, she would be “the first D.S.A. D.A.”) There was Jeff Deskovic, who endured sixteen years in prison after he was wrongly convicted; five years ago, a jury awarded him forty million dollars, and a week before the election he contributed three thousand dollars to Cabán’s campaign.\n\nSix screens aired Spectrum News NY-1, and at first they showed that Cabán was in second place, trailing Katz. But, before long, the numbers shifted, and Cabán gained a slight lead. The crowd screamed, and, every time Cabán’s numbers ticked up a bit, the crowd screamed again. “Tiff-a-ny! Tiff-a-ny!” When a NY-1 reporter tried to interview Krasner, and his face appeared on the screens, the crowd began hollering again: “Larry! Larry! Larry!” During breaks in the chants, people hunched over their cell phones, checking the Board of Elections Web site for the most up-to-date results. At about 9:20 *P.M*{:.small}., Cabán held a lead of two percentage points, with two-thirds of the precincts reporting results. Half an hour later, her lead had shrunk to less than one point, but by then the votes in ninety per cent of precincts had been tallied. \n\nEventually, the screens showed that Cabán was ahead by a little more than a thousand votes with ninety-nine percent of the precincts reporting. With so many bodies crammed together, the room had grown sweaty, but the news prompted the crowd to shriek and holler, fists punching the air. Soon after 11 *P.M*{:.small}., Cabán appeared behind the podium, and supporters held up their  cell phones to film her. “What’s up, y’all?” she said—and the crowd cheered again. She ran through all the reasons she was not expected to win. “They said I was too young.”\n\n“Boo!”\n\n“They said I didn’t look like a D.A.”\n\n“Boo!”\n\n“They said we could not build a movement from the grass roots!”\n\n“Boo!”\n\n“They said we could not win, but we did it, y’all!”\n\nKatz had already spoken to her supporters at her Election Night party, at Banter Irish Bar, in Forest Hills, but she had not conceded defeat. There were more than six thousand paper ballots yet to be counted; the final tally would have to wait another week. But, as far as the crowd at La Boom was concerned, Cabán was the victor. After she finished her speech, the d.j. turned up the music. The crowd appeared both euphoric and stunned. Some supporters started to dance; others walked around in a daze. It seemed almost impossible to imagine that in Queens, the land of Archie Bunker and the home town of Donald J. Trump, the most powerful law-enforcement official might actually turn out to be Tiffany Cabán.\n\nThe race is not officially over, and, even if Cabán is declared the primary winner, she will have to run again in the general election, in November, though in Queens the winner of the Democratic primary typically prevails. If Cabán is sworn in as the next District Attorney, she may find that, no matter how hard it was to win this election, actually delivering on her promises will be far more difficult. The job of the Queens D.A. is very different from the job of Ocasio-Cortez and other members of Congress. The Queens D.A. oversees a huge bureaucracy with more than seven hundred employees; last year, the office handled more than forty-five thousand arrests. As other newly elected progressive prosecutors have learned, a new D.A. can write any policy she wants and e-mail it to the entire staff, but that does not insure that everyone will follow it.\n\nAt the Philadelphia D.A.’s office, in the months after Krasner took over, tensions grew so intense that new employees would find themselves stepping into an office elevator packed with co-workers only to have everyone else stop talking. An anonymous Twitter account began chronicling the inner workings of the office, mocking Krasner and broadcasting his new employees’ missteps. The same day as the election in Queens, [*The Appeal* published a story](https://theappeal.org/progressive-philly-d-a-larry-krasners-bail-reform-plans-seem-stalled-advocates-say/) in which advocates criticized Krasner for not reforming his bail policies more quickly and expansively.\n\nAt Cabán’s party, though, nobody was in a skeptical mood. Supporters hugged one another, danced onstage, and ripped Cabán posters off the walls to take home as souvenirs. The music was so loud that conversation was virtually impossible, but Thomas Hoffman, a seventy-five-year-old lawyer, was not in a rush to leave. He had been on his feet since *9 A.M*{:.small}., campaigning for Cabán outside a polling site in Kew Gardens, near the Queens County Criminal Courts Building. His determination to help elect Cabán had its origins in a day in 2004 when he received a letter from a man in prison named Kareem Bellamy. Ten years earlier, Bellamy had been arrested in Queens for murder, but he insisted that he was innocent. Hoffman agreed to represent him, spent seven years working pro bono on his case, and got him exonerated.\n\nEver since, Hoffman has been receiving letters from people in prison asking for his help. He had spent years trying to draw attention to the cases of other people whom he believed were wrongly convicted, but the Queens D.A.’s office had no wrongful-conviction unit; he could not find anyone to listen to his concerns. “There are so many cases I had that, if there was an independent inquiry, they’d be walking the streets today,” he said. It was a long and lonely crusade, but now here he was, staring up at a television screen with the election results, surrounded by twenty- and thirtysomethings who had helped propel the campaign of a young woman who promised to transform the D.A.’s office. Long after Cabán left the stage, Hoffman still seemed to be in shock. “Can you believe this?” he said. He walked around the dance floor, shaking his head. “These young kids did this,” he said, surveying the crowd. “It is unbelievable.”

Sivin, who is thirty, and Sundaram, who is twenty-three, had become friends while working with Amplify Her, an organization that supports progressive women running for local offices. They ordered salads, and soon the conversation turned to the upcoming election for Queens District Attorney. A man named Richard A. Brown had held the title of Queens D.A. for about as long as they had been alive; now, at age eighty-six, he was not expected to run again. (Brown announced that he would not seek reëlection in January, and he died in May.) As the women talked through the list of potential candidates, they shared the same frustration: “Where are the progressive women of color in this race—somebody who can really transform that office?”\n\nSivin is Puerto Rican; Sundaram is Indian-American. The conversation paused, as they both skimmed their mental Rolodexes. After a few moments, Sivin came up with a name: “Tiff could run!” \n\nTheir friend Tiffany Cabán was thirty-one and born and raised in Queens, with grandparents from Puerto Rico. Sivin, who had worked with Cabán at New York County Defender Services, knew her as a “very effective” public defender who spent her days representing poor people in the criminal courthouses in Manhattan. Sivin also had a hunch that Cabán would be an excellent campaigner. A few months earlier, she had invited Cabán to South Brooklyn to volunteer for a woman running for state senate, and she had been impressed by how hard Cabán had hustled: handing out flyers to strangers, starting up conversations, winning them over. \n\nSivin reached for her cell phone and fired off five text messages:\n\n> Dude\n> \n> Run for DA in Queens\n> \n> Let’s make it happen\n> \n> You’ve got the vacation days\n> \n> Let’s go\n\nCabán ignored her entreaty. “Alana! What’s up girl!” she wrote. “Miss ya.”\n\nSivin responded, “I know! Now we can get to work and you can run for DA….”\n\n“You serious?” Cabán wrote.\n\n“Yes.”\n\nA week later, the three women met at Maxwell’s, a bar in Tribeca, and called in another friend, Stephanie Silkowski, to help. “None of us had a ton of connections,” Silkowski, who is twenty-seven, told me. “There were no paid consultants leading the way.” One of their first tasks was to fill out the candidate questionnaire that was being circulated by the local chapter of the Democratic Socialists of America. They figured that securing the D.S.A.’s endorsement would be crucial, since, as Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s recent victory in a Bronx-Queens congressional race had shown, the D.S.A. included a large number of young people who, for the right candidate, would be willing to work very hard for free.\n\nThere was a time not long ago when a public defender would never consider running for District Attorney. Cabán told me that, when her friends first tried to persuade her to run, “It took me a while to really commit because there’s lots to reconcile there.” Her experiences as a public defender had led her to conclude that “the way that our system functions, there’s no good way to be a District Attorney, a prosecutor.” But she also kept saying to herself, “Well, somebody is going to sit in that seat.” Two years earlier, in Philadelphia, a veteran defense attorney named [Larry Krasner](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/10/29/larry-krasners-campaign-to-end-mass-incarceration), who had started his career as a public defender, had a similar internal debate. Three months before the primary, he entered the race for District Attorney, a seven-way contest, and stunned Philadelphia’s legal establishment by winning.\n\nCabán had followed Krasner’s campaign closely. “The things that he was running on—everybody wanted to call it radical reform,” she said. “What you learn doing the work if you’re a public defender, or if you’re part of the communities affected by our justice system—it’s common sense.” In his speech announcing his candidacy, Krasner declared, “We need to decarcerate. We need to get people out of jails.” He called for sending more people to drug treatment instead of prison, reforming the bail system, cracking down on police misconduct, and ending mass incarceration. “People thought he was crazy,” Cabán said, but she admired the fact that he “just did exactly what he thought was right.” Krasner became the best known of a new crop of D.A.s who call themselves “progressive prosecutors” and who have won office in recent years with the help of activists and philanthropists pushing for criminal-justice reform. Cabán also followed the work of newly elected D.A.s like Rachael Rollins, in Boston, and Wesley Bell, in St. Louis; their achievements, she said, left her “feeling encouraged and emboldened.”\n\nWhen Cabán filled out the D.S.A. questionnaire, she described herself as “a proud queer Latina born and raised in Richmond Hill, Queens,” and declared that she was running for D.A. “because I am frustrated and infuriated by the system within which we operate.” Her frustration, she explained, came from “constantly seeing decision-making happen that didn’t serve any purpose,” that often seemed intended just “to punish people rather than to help make them whole and keep them rooted in their communities.” Cabán cited Krasner, who likes to refer to progressive prosecutors as “public defenders with power.” But, to Cabán, Krasner hadn’t gone far enough. “I am running to implement even more radical, necessary change,” she wrote.\n\nCabán promised that, if elected, she would decline to prosecute not only marijuana cases, turnstile jumping, and prostitution but also trespassing, disorderly conduct, loitering, drug possession, and welfare fraud. She attacked the “crooked bail bond industry,” and wrote, “As D.A., my position would be to end cash bail.” She said that she would “withdraw immediately” from the District Attorneys Association of New York; such organizations can have an outsized influence on criminal-justice legislation and, in her view, “tend to have regressive, racist, and classist ‘tough on crime’ mentalities.”\n\nOn January 25th, Cabán announced her candidacy. By then, three other candidates—Rory Lancman, a member of the City Council; Greg Lasak, a former judge and prosecutor; and Melinda Katz, the borough president of Queens—each had raised at least a half-million dollars. Cabán stayed at her job until March, then took a leave of absence and gave up her health insurance. (“I was offered *COBRA*{:.small} coverage, but I couldn’t afford it,” she said.) The early months of her campaign were [chaotic](https://thecity.nyc/2019/05/tiffany-cabns-bumpy-campaign-to-become-queens-next-da.html), in part because there was so little money to pay staffers. Her first two campaign managers left—though one stayed on as an adviser—and two volunteers took over. The New York City chapter of the D.S.A. endorsed her candidacy in February, and, in April, the Working Families Party (W.F.P.) endorsed her, too, bringing two decades of electoral experience to her campaign. \n\nIn the Democratic primary, which will be held on June 25th, Cabán faces six opponents. Voter turnout is expected to be extremely low, since there is no other major race on the ballot. In the end, Cabán’s fate will likely be determined by her campaign’s ability to persuade people who wouldn’t typically vote in this election to go to the polls—the same strategy that propelled Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez into Congress. “In theory, there were a million things against her,” Bill Lipton, the director of the New York State Working Families Party, said of Cabán. “She’s thirty-one, she’s not a prosecutor, she doesn’t have enough money.” But, Lipton added, “She’s a *really* good candidate. On the stump, she’s really strong—charismatic, authentic, honest.” While Cabán is certainly the underdog, Lipton insists, “Victory is possible.” \n\n The W.F.P. offered to pay for a campaign manager and recommended a few. Cabán hired Luke Hayes, who is thirty-five and the younger brother of the MSNBC host Chris Hayes. (Luke Hayes served as President Barack Obama’s state director for Nevada in 2012, and last year he was the field director on the campaign of another young woman, Alessandra Biaggi, who ousted a powerful state senator, in the Bronx.) The W.F.P. also helped to pay for other staffers, including a field organizer. Cabán now has fourteen paid staffers and, she told me, more than three hundred volunteers. But her paucity of campaign money has meant that, by necessity, her campaign has become a “family affair,” as Hayes put it. “Tiffany’s mom comes by her house once a week to stock her up on groceries and help clean up,” Hayes says. “I got my mom making some ready-made meals that Tiffany can heat up at night.” Hayes’s father delivers the meals to the campaign office—typically chicken cutlets or lasagna—and he has been knocking on doors for her, too. \n\nCabán’s campaign office—on the fourth-floor of a walkup building in Jackson Heights—is a hand-me-down from the state senator Jessica Ramos. (Last year, Ramos, a thirty-three-year-old former mayoral aide, launched a long-shot campaign against an incumbent—and won.) When I visited the office at 9 *A.M*{:.small}. on a recent weekday, Cabán was the only person there. But over the next hour, one young man after another walked in: her deputy finance director, a volunteer searching for posters, her field director, her campaign manager. Sasha Weinstein, twenty-five, oversees her field operation. “We’ve got a team of twenty-five or thirty organizers who I really trust to lead an event, train other volunteers, and report back to me,” he said. Many of them were volunteers on Ocasio-Cortez’s campaign; the most dedicated are known as “supervols.” Groups of volunteers hand out flyers at subway stations and Greenmarkets, persuade bodega owners to put up Cabán posters in their windows, and climb the stairs in apartment buildings to knock on doors. One supervol hosted a regular Thursday-night event, which, according to Cabán, has been “really, really successful.” She said, “They do a canvassing event, then they all go to a different gay bar to watch ‘RuPaul’s Drag Race,’ and they canvass there.”\n\nFour of Caban’s six opponents are former prosecutors, and many of the candidates have embraced the term “progressive prosecutor.” To differentiate herself from the others, Cabán, who has proposed the most sweeping reforms, has begun to employ a different term: “decarceral prosecutor.” She is the only public defender in the race—a fact she likes to point out—and, at candidate forums, which are held each week in different neighborhoods, she has demonstrated a Krasner-like ability to present her views in a way that commands attention. When she tweeted  a one-minute video clip of her speaking at a recent forum—“Cash bail is wrong. Period. We will never ask for it. You can’t have two systems of justice: one for the poor and one for the wealthy”—the video drew more than four hundred thousand views. \n\nIn early May, the N.F.L. Players Coalition hosted a candidate forum, moderated by the Patriots free safety Devin McCourty, in Astoria. Seated onstage alongside her opponents, Cabán appeared the least imposing: the youngest candidate by at least a decade, she’s also only five-three and was dressed in the same plain pants suit that she used to wear in the courtroom. At one point, McCourty told the candidates that they could ask one opponent a question. Jose Nieves—a lawyer for eighteen years, a former prosecutor in the Brooklyn D.A.’s office, and a former deputy chief in the state Attorney General’s office—went straight at Cabán: “Ms. Cabán has less than six years of experience practicing law. She has never led an organization or even a group larger than five people. How is it possible that you can lead an agency of over six hundred people when you’ve never done it in your career, or in your life?”\n\nCabán, unfazed, hopped up from her chair, microphone in hand. “I have seven years of experience as a criminal-defense lawyer representing over a thousand clients on cases from turnstiles to homicides,” she said. “When we talk about what it takes to bring these kinds of reforms into the office—the progressive prosecutor, the twenty-first-century prosecutor—these are the things that public defenders have been fighting for, on the front lines in court and in Albany, for decades. We know them better than anyone.”\n\nPerhaps the greatest challenge Cabán confronts in trying to win this election is the sheer size of Queens. The borough has nearly 2\\.3 million residents—more than many states, including New Mexico and West Virginia. “This is going to be an election for the entire borough, which is three, maybe four times the size of A.O.C.’s congressional district,” Andrew Hacker, a professor of political science at Queens College, told me. “The borough of Queens sprawls all the way from Astoria to the Rockaways, and I have a hunch the borough president”—Melinda Katz—“is just going to walk away with it,” he said. “When you take the whole borough of Queens, the main voters are still white people who live particularly in eastern Queens—Little Neck, Douglaston, and so on—and they’re grandparents, cadres of people who are politically involved and who turn out. A lot of those people have been raised with Melinda Katz. They know her.”\n\nWhen the most recent campaign filings were released, in late May, Katz had the most money in her campaign coffers ($907,000), followed by Lancman ($529,000). Cabán had only $151,000\\. But, the Queens *Daily Eagle* noted, Cabán had “more individual donations than the other six candidates combined”—a total of 2,545, compared with Katz’s three hundred. Cabán’s campaign celebrated, tweeting out the story. “It shows she has real grassroots support,” Monica Klein, her communications director, said. Cabán’s donors include the three friends who first convinced her to run; numerous campaign volunteers; Susan Sarandon; Brad Lander, a city council member from Brooklyn; and Kareem Bellamy, who spent fourteen years in prison after he was wrongly convicted of murder, in Queens, in 1994\\. Many of Cabán’s contributors cannot vote for her since they don’t reside in Queens; donations came in from more than a dozen states.\n\nFrom the beginning, Cabán’s campaign had hoped to win the support of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Last year, Cabán moved to Astoria, and now, as it happens, Ocasio-Cortez is her congressperson. The two first met in March, when Cabán stopped by Ocasio-Cortez’s office opening in Jackson Heights. Then, in mid-May, Ocasio-Cortez’s office arranged a call with Cabán, and the two spoke on the phone for the first time. \n\nWhen deciding whether to make an endorsement, Ocasio-Cortez told me, “There’s a couple things that are really personally valuable to me.” The first concerns the campaign’s organizing efforts. “I asked a lot of questions to flush things out. How many doors are being knocked? How many phone calls are happening? What is your voter-contact ratio? Those really nitty-gritty metrics are extremely important to me.” She added, “I really appreciate when a candidate seeking office knows the plan themselves and really takes an elevated degree of ownership—particularly when it comes to a progressive movement, because progressive campaigns are most often underfunded compared to their competition. So you really have to have a super tight operation.”\n\nOcasio-Cortez also wanted to hear about how Cabán’s work had shaped her views on the criminal-justice system. Cabán told her about some of her experiences as a public defender, and Ocasio-Cortez saw a parallel with her own past. “The way that my experience as a waitress really brings into stark relief advocacy for working-class issues . . . I think Tiffany’s experience as a public defender similarly brings into relief advocacy for criminal-justice reform,” she said. Perhaps unsurprisingly, Ocasio-Cortez, too, had noticed what’s been happening in Philadelphia. “If Tiffany Cabán wins this race, it will be similar to what Larry Krasner did in Pennsylvania, and I think that's the direction that the country needs to go in over all,” she added. \n\nA campaign that started last fall with Cabán’s female friends urging her to run appeared to come full circle on May 22nd, when Ocasio-Cortez endorsed her. The congresswoman sent a statement to the *Times* announcing her endorsement, tweeted about Cabán to her four million Twitter followers, and sent an e-mail to supporters urging them to donate three dollars to Cabán’s campaign. “For too long, the DA has stood by while mass incarceration has ravaged our communities,” she wrote. “If Tiffany wins, things are going to change.” Cabán’s euphoria was evident on Twitter, where she wrote, “@AOC just endorsed our campaign! Alexandria’s a fierce advocate for working people & an inspiration for women of color like me.”\n\nOn the afternoon of June 2nd, Ocasio-Cortez and Cabán, both with their hair pulled back in ponytails, met up at the gay-pride parade in Jackson Heights. Ocasio-Cortez gave Cabán an enthusiastic hug, held aloft a Cabán-for-D.A. poster, and told the crowd, “If you don’t know, you’re about to know: Tiffany Cabán is going to be our next District Attorney!”","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1cc52bc86f2c9a244a11","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Queens","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"queens"},{"id":"5c2e1c797e716b454591ada7","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Elections","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"elections"},{"id":"5c2e1c7a2710c62d1081540c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"alexandria-ocasio-cortez"},{"id":"5c2e1d792bc86f2c9a244ab1","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Democratic Socialists of America","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"democratic-socialists-of-america"},{"id":"5c2e1cc47e716b454591ae19","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Progressives","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"progressives"},{"id":"5c2e1c882bfcc72cd92d0544","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Criminal-Justice Reform","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"criminal-justice-reform"}],"sections":[{"id":"5cd5d0537bf70b38e5de7967","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Our Local Correspondents","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"our-local-correspondents"}]},"channel":"News","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"5910a8ac6c4c222f03a82ea4","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Jennifer Gonnerman has been a staff writer for The New Yorker since 2015.

Most people whose lives end on Rikers die of natural causes, but there is no doubt that some deaths there have been caused by the culture and conditions of Rikers itself. This tally of preventable deaths includes: Jason Echevarria, twenty-five, who swallowed a packet of soap in his cell, screamed in agony for hours, and died after guards refused to take him to the medical clinic; Carlos Mercado, forty-five, a diabetic in desperate need of insulin, who collapsed in a hallway his first day in jail; Ronald Spear, fifty-two, a kidney-dialysis patient, who died after being kicked in the head by a guard.\n\nEvery year, several thousand people across the country die while imprisoned. Local officials report the number of deaths to the Department of Justice, but very little attention is paid to the question of how many of these deaths could have been prevented. Several years ago, Homer Venters, a physician and the former chief medical officer for New York City’s Correctional Health Services, sought to answer this question. Between 2010 and 2016, there were a hundred and twelve deaths in New York City jails. Venters and his team found that ten to twenty per cent of those deaths each year were “caused by actions taken inside the walls” of a jail. He calls these “jail-attributable deaths,” and writes that some years the percentage of such deaths “rose to half or more.” \n\nReporters have virtually no access to the jails on Rikers Island, but, for many years, Venters had a rare vantage point from which to observe its inner workings. He started working on Rikers in 2008, overseeing health care for thousands of people imprisoned there. On an island known for abuse and violence, Venters became a legendary figure; he often spoke about human rights and was known for his persistent advocacy on behalf of inmates. He left the city’s jail-health service in 2017, and now he has written a crucially important book, “[Life and Death in Rikers Island](https://www.amazon.com/Death-Rikers-Island-Homer-Venters/dp/1421427354),” in which he examines one of the most overlooked aspects of mass incarceration: the health risks of being locked up.\n\nEight jails now operate on Rikers, each with its own medical clinics, where incarcerated people go if they feel sick or need follow-up care, often for diseases like diabetes or asthma. But part of what makes jails such health risks for the people confined there is the insidious way that the environment undermines the ability of medical staff to perform their jobs. In 2013, officials at Rikers stopped allowing incarcerated people to walk to clinics alone; now a guard had to escort them—and, suddenly, inmates were missing their appointments nearly half the time. Venters writes, “We would give security staff list after list of the ‘must see’ patients whom we feared might die without receiving care.” This strategy worked, but only temporarily. “We might make a brief improvement,” he writes, “and then a friendly deputy warden would be promoted, transferred, or fired, and we would fall back to half or fewer of our patients being produced.” Although the situation has improved, the problem persists.\n\nThe culture clash between guards and medical staff on Rikers was apparent even in the way that the two groups spoke about the people confined there: guards called them “inmates,” while medical workers called them “patients.” At times, medical staff found themselves caught in an ethical dilemma: Was their primary loyalty to their patients or to the system in which they work? This conundrum is known as “dual loyalty,” and Venters writes that, on Rikers, the “most dramatic and tortured aspect of dual loyalty” involves the role that medical staff play in sending people to solitary confinement. Jail managers who wanted to lock an individual in solitary first had to obtain “clearance” from a mental-health worker—assurance that the inmate would not harm himself if isolated for twenty-three hours a day. Venters is a fierce critic of the process. “Health clearance for solitary is not based on any reliable science and violates basic medical ethics because, of course, that patient is supposed to suffer,” he writes. “It’s punishment, after all.” \n\nRikers has long been notorious for its culture of brutality, and, soon after Venters started working there, he sought to determine exactly why so many inmates were being injured. The main cause of injuries was fights with other incarcerated people, but the secondary cause—accounting for about a quarter of injuries—was listed as “slip and falls,” according to official records. Venters and his team developed an injury-surveillance system, with drop-down menus where medical staff could document how and where the injuries had occurred. Soon a pattern of abuse by guards emerged—and the prevalence of slip and falls made more sense. If an incarcerated person had his nose broken by an officer’s fist, he was unlikely to tell the truth when brought to the medical clinic; fearing retaliation from guards, he might instead say that he had slipped in the shower.\n\nVenters began combing this electronic database each week, identifying patients whose records showed that they had “sustained serious injuries during an interaction with correctional officers,” or whose stories of how they got hurt did not match their injuries (“like a jaw fracture from falling on a toilet”). “Then, at about 5:00 pm on Fridays, I would take my list and go to the jails where these patients were being held,” he writes. At that hour, he knew that he’d be able to move around with more freedom and less scrutiny, and he always made a point of wearing his stethoscope. But, he writes, “Within a few weeks of starting these Friday night encounters, the inmates and DOC [Department of Correction] staff alike came to recognize that I was coming to these housing areas and intake pens for reasons that went beyond simple checkups.” He continues, “Correctional officers would stiffen and slow-walk my requests to see patients. In some instances, officers would outright refuse to produce patients for me to see.” \n\nSometimes, Venters would encounter a patient whose injuries were more serious than the medical staff had initially thought, and he would try to correct the record. But when he would send an e-mail to D.O.C. officials asking to upgrade an injury, he recalls that he would get back “a flood of responses” intended to derail his efforts. Venters recounts one visit from a D.O.C. investigator “with zero clinical training” who “tried to poke holes” in his diagnosis. “Her challenging of my clinical assessment that a patient had suffered a nasal fracture was maddening,” he writes. “But had I been one of our hundreds of physician assistants or physicians”—instead of a senior official—“the message would have been clear: this isn’t a path you want to go down.” \n\nTo conceal the extent of the abuse toward inmates, Venters discovered, guards would sometimes hide individuals with suspicious injuries in remote jail cells. Venters describes receiving a call one day from a doctor who reported that guards had just beaten a patient in a waiting area at a clinic and that “the patient had been dragged away without receiving care and had not been seen since.” Venters went searching for him. “After failing to find him in any of the normal hiding spots in this jail, I went to another facility where ‘problematic’ patients were often sent,” he writes. “I found him in a remote part&nbsp;.&thinsp;.&thinsp;.&nbsp;and heard him sobbing before I saw him in his cell.”\n\nEven more haunting is a story Venters recounts about a night, in December, 2012, when officers attacked incarcerated people *inside* a clinic. The next morning, Venters found a doctor there beginning her work shift by wiping blood off of cabinet doors. The night before, guards had brought in two young men, restrained on gurneys, then “yelled at the medical staff to get in the back of the clinic, after which the beatings began,” Venters writes. “I got the stories of several staff, some of whom made it clear they would not repeat their observations to others out of fear for their own safety.” But Venters did find one employee who was willing to relay details of the beatings to his boss, Dr. Tom Farley, who was then the commissioner of the New York City Department of Health. Venters writes, “She said something to Dr. Farley that revealed the normalization of abuse in jails: ‘I’m new here and I didn’t know that when this happens, we’re supposed to go in the back and stay out of the way.’” \n\nThe *[Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/14/nyregion/rikers-study-finds-prisoners-injured-by-employees.html)* investigated the incident, in 2014, and the U.S. Attorney’s office for the Southern District of New York mentioned it in a report that year about Rikers, but no criminal charges were filed against the officers. Meanwhile, the worker who spoke up endured retaliation. “She was verbally harassed by DOC staff and started to receive calls from currently incarcerated patients to her cell phone,” Venters writes. “Despite our best efforts to create a safe work environment by transferring her to alternate facilities, she left her job shortly thereafter.” Medical workers told Venters that after speaking up about other incidents, they, too, faced retaliation, including “slashed tires” and “dead flowers on their computers.” \n\nLate one night, during the same month that the clinic beatings occurred, Ronald Spear, a kidney-dialysis patient, at the North Infirmary Command repeatedly demanded to see a doctor. He was feeling ill and, around 5 *A.M.*{: .small}, he snuck out of his dorm to go to the medical office next door. A jail guard named Brian Coll stopped him. The doctor on duty said that he was busy and Spear would have to wait. Then Coll and Spear got into a scuffle. Two other guards pinned Spear to the floor, following the usual procedure. But the incident did not end there; while Spear was restrained, Coll repeatedly kicked him in the head. Spear died minutes later. When Venters arrived later that day, D.O.C. investigators and a homicide detective were present, and Spear’s body was still on the floor. \n\nVenters doesn’t write about Coll’s subsequent criminal prosecution, but, at Coll’s trial, in 2016, three medical staff took the witness stand. Their testimony revealed Rikers’ unofficial rule about medical workers averting their eyes when guards have a physical altercation. Despite the commotion in the hallway outside the medical offices—which one person said sounded like “bodies hitting the ground”—the nurse on duty did not investigate. “I opened the door and I immediately closed it,” she said. The doctor on duty testified that he did not open his office door or peer out the window. Instead, he remained seated at his desk, where, he said, he was trying “to finish my paperwork” before his overnight shift ended. Eventually, a captain knocked on the door and asked the doctor to evaluate Spear, who was lying face down, wrists cuffed behind his back. “He was right in front of the door,” the doctor testified. “He has no pulse.”\n\nThe usual response to preventable deaths that occur inside a jail is to pin the blame on a few rogue guards (or incompetent medical workers), but Venters argues that the truth is far more complicated. “Because jails are chaotic and concealed from outside view, we only become aware of them when very bad outcomes occur, such as deaths,” he writes. “As a result, our periodic glimpses into this area miss the systemic failings of the systems we’ve designed, and we make the repeated error of blaming individuals for outcomes that we’ve essentially predetermined.” \n\nAccording to Venters, these systemic failures include not only Rikers’ culture of brutality but also something more surprising: guards used “paper logbooks” to record when an inmate arrives and leaves a housing area, which meant that the medical staff did not always know where their patients were located. There were times when an incarcerated person would be “moved from one spot to another without any new information being entered into the security system,” Venters writes. As a result, “medical, mental health, pharmacy, and nursing staff” would be forced “to roam the halls of the jails every day physically looking for their patients.” Jail officials have begun trying to track inmates with wristbands, but the paper logbooks are still in use, and, in Venters’ view, this “archaic paper-based approach to information management&nbsp;.&thinsp;.&thinsp;.&nbsp;may be the single greatest contributor to abuse and neglect in the jails.”\n\nMayor Bill de Blasio has promised that Rikers Island will eventually be closed, and, in preparation, New York City has been working to reduce the number of people held in its jails. In January, de Blasio announced that the jail population “had dropped to less than eight thousand people for the first time in almost forty years.” Now the number of guards on the city’s payroll actually exceeds the number of incarcerated people. But Rikers’ culture of brutality persists, and many of its jails are falling apart. “The medical infirmary was literally the DOC bus garage before they decided to upgrade their bus fleet to another site and hand the space over to us for our sickest patients,” Venters writes. “I’ve often heard complaints about inmates who would file lawsuits about bits of the ceiling material falling down on them, but the scope of the problem became clear to me when we received a report that a rotting animal carcass had fallen into the patient area.” \n\nIn the end, Venters places the blame for the “slow-rolling disaster” of the city’s jails at the very top, with City Hall. New York City, “like many cities and counties,” he writes, “turned its back on jail conditions for years, and a culture of mismanagement and brutality took hold that has not been removed.” He makes few distinctions between de Blasio and his predecessor, Michael Bloomberg. “Having led the health service across two mayoral administrations, one a centrist Republican and the other a progressive Democrat,” Venter writes, “I have seen remarkable consistency in how the incompetence of the correctional service was not only tolerated but also supported.” Now, with “Life and Death in Rikers Island,” Venters reveals the true human cost of these colossal management failures.","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1d7a81ab3335f580f25d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Rikers Island","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"rikers-island"},{"id":"5c2e1f44b75f002c8941e6e3","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Jail","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"jail"},{"id":"5c2e206b425c632c6cd708a5","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Book","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"book"},{"id":"5c2e1ca7ee7fe02cbd163370","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Health","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"health"}],"sections":[{"id":"5af46dde7505432fc35f6232","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Under Review","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"under-review"}]},"channel":"Books","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"5910a8ac6c4c222f03a82ea4","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Jennifer Gonnerman has been a staff writer for The New Yorker since 2015.

Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the New York Democrat, said that the [recent release](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/30/us/census-citizenship-question-hofeller.html) of documents written by a deceased Republican operative revealed that the true motivation behind the change was to undercount minorities in the census and shift power to Republicans. “I want to know why this question was magically added after we have seen that a political operative knew and detailed an intent to intimidate racial and immigrant communities for a partisan purpose, saying, ‘This will hurt Democrats and help Republicans,’&nbsp;” she said in [remarks](https://twitter.com/cspan/status/1138825969530286081) that quickly went viral. “I want to know about the racism and the very disturbing history that we’re seeing here. That’s what I want to know.”\n\nThe Supreme Court, which is set to rule any day now on the legality of Ross’s decision to [contradict Census Bureau experts](https://www.propublica.org/article/wilbur-ross-overruled-career-officials-at-census-bureau-to-add-citizenship-question) and push ahead with a citizenship question, wasn’t [asked](https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/18/18-966/81777/20190125163140500_2019-01-25%20Commerce%20CBJ%20petn.pdf) to address whether racism played a role in the Trump Administration’s desire for a question in the 2020 count. At its heart, the legal dispute is one about federal administrative law—that is, whether Ross’s work with Trump appointees in the Justice Department to create a legal justification for adding a citizenship question was arbitrary and capricious under the [Administrative Procedure Act](https://www.supremecourt.gov/docket/docketfiles/html/qp/18-00966qp.pdf). Three federal judges so far, including the one whose ruling the Supreme Court is reviewing, have said that Ross acted improperly under federal law. But lower-court judges declined to rule against the government on the issue of willful discrimination against minorities, which requires proof that Ross intended to disfavor people of color on the basis of race. \n\nFew claims in constitutional law are as charged as the accusation that the government took actions designed to discriminate against minorities. But that’s precisely what advocates in New York and Maryland did in legal challenges they filed last year to the Administration’s decision to include a citizenship question in the census questionnaire that will be sent to households next year. “The inclusion of a citizenship question in the decennial Census violates the equal protection guarantee of the Fifth Amendment because it is motivated by racial animus towards Latinos, Asian Americans, and animus towards non-U.S. citizens and foreign-born persons,” the plaintiffs [alleged](https://www.brennancenter.org/sites/default/files/legal-work/LUPE_v_Ross_Complaint.pdf) in a lawsuit seeking, among other things, a declaration that the question is unconstitutional. New York plaintiffs, in [their own complaint](https://www.aclu.org/legal-document/nyic-v-dept-commerce-complaint), filed last year in federal court, contended that Trump Administration officials “maintain animus toward these groups and intend, *inter alia*, to diminish the political power and influence of these groups and to reduce the levels of federal and state funding, benefits, and other resources that these groups receive.” \n\nThis past October, the Supreme Court delivered an early victory to the Administration. It [blocked](https://www.scotusblog.com/2018/10/justices-block-ross-deposition-in-census-dispute/) attempts to put Ross under oath, which could have helped  challengers probe the secretary’s true motives for adding the citizenship question. Lower courts subsequently ruled that the challengers lacked adequate evidence to prove their claims of discriminatory intent by Ross. In an extensive ruling otherwise [striking down the citizenship question](https://www.brennancenter.org/sites/default/files/legal-work/2019-01-15-574-Findings%20Of%20Fact.pdf), U.S. District Judge Jesse Furman wrote, in January, that the New York challengers “did not carry their burden of proving” that Ross “was motivated by invidious discrimination and thus that he violated the equal protection component” found in the Constitution. \n\nSimilarly, in Maryland, U.S. District Judge George Hazel called Ross’s actual rationale for adding the question “a mystery,” while ruling against the secretary under the Administrative Procedure Act and the Constitution’s [enumeration clause](https://www.census.gov/history/pdf/Article_1_Section_2.pdf), which imposes the census requirement every ten years. Not surprisingly, the issue of discrimination [didn’t come up](https://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/2018/18-966_i4dj.pdf) when the Supreme Court heard oral arguments in the census case in April.\n\nBut the [recent discovery of a trove of files](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/30/us/census-citizenship-question-hofeller.html) from the deceased Republican operative and redistricting expert Thomas Hofeller may force the Court to address the issue. The documents that Hofeller’s estranged daughter found on backups of the [noted Republican mapmaker](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/21/obituaries/thomas-hofeller-republican-master-of-political-maps-dies-at-75.html)’s laptop have since been brought to the attention of both the New York and Maryland judges, and [the Supreme Court is also aware of it](https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/12/politics/aclu-census-supreme-court-delay/index.html). Hofeller, the documents show, conducted a private [study](https://www.brennancenter.org/sites/default/files/legal-work/2019-05-30-NYIC%20Respondents%20Notice%20of%20Filing.pdf) in 2015 which concluded that a citizenship question would decrease the political power of Latinos and “be advantageous to Republicans and Non-Hispanic Whites” in the redistricting process; he also wrote that employing citizenship data derived from the census “can be expected to provoke a high degree of resistance from Democrats and the major minority groups in the nation.” Hofeller later urged the Trump Administration to adopt a citizenship question and helped craft its public legal argument that the Census Bureau needed citizenship data to better enforce the Voting Rights Act of 1965.\n\nIn constitutional litigation, that’s as close to a smoking gun of discriminatory motive as a plaintiff could hope for in court. In a ruling on Monday, Hazel opened the door to revisiting his earlier ruling in the Maryland case and allowing for an examination of whether a desire to target Latinos was a motivating factor for adding the citizenship question. The “new evidence,” Hazel [wrote](https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/6166168/Maryland-Census-20190624.pdf), “potentially connects the dots between a discriminatory purpose—diluting Hispanics’ political power—and Secretary Ross’s decision. The evidence suggests that Dr. Hofeller was motivated to recommend the addition of a citizenship question to the 2020 Census to advantage Republicans by diminishing Hispanics’ political power.” Hazel added that “as more puzzle pieces are placed on the mat, a disturbing picture of the decisionmakers’ motives takes shape.” \n\nThe Trump Administration, for its part, has argued that relitigating this part of the case is “[unwarranted](https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/6167246/June-24-2019-Response-in-Opposition-to.pdf)” in light of the looming deadline to print census forms and the Supreme Court’s imminent ruling.\n\nNow a mini-skirmish over whether discrimination infected the process of adding a citizenship question has landed in the Supreme Court. On Monday, in yet another eleventh-hour [filing](https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/18/18-966/103876/20190624152958268_PDFA%20NYIC%20Respondents%20Notice%20re%20Related%20Case%20Ruling%20and%20Census%20Bureau%20Publication.pdf), the Justices were notified of Hazel’s ruling, which the New York plaintiffs said were “changed circumstances” worthy of the Court’s attention. And on Tuesday, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit gave Hazel yet another boost, giving him the [go-ahead](https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/6168232/4th-Circuit-Census.pdf) to examine the new evidence—plus some guidance on how to weigh it. “In addressing and resolving those matters,” U.S. Circuit Judge James Wynn wrote, “the district court should keep in mind that discriminatory intent *need not be proved by direct evidence*.” Wynn has experience with cases alleging similar discrimination; in 2016, he was a member of a three-judge panel that [found](http://www.ca4.uscourts.gov/opinions/published/161468.p.pdf) that Republicans in North Carolina enacted a voting law that targeted “African Americans with almost surgical precision.”\n\n\nIn a surprise filing late on Tuesday, the Trump Administration invited the Supreme Court to consider the question of racial discrimination. Noel Francisco, the Department of Justice’s Solicitor General, fired off [his own letter to the Court](https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/18/18-966/104091/20190625161322614_DEPT%20OF%20COMMERCE%20ET%20AL%2018-966%20LETTER.pdf), urging a final resolution of the claim that the expert’s files are evidence of racist motives in Ross’s decision-making process. According to Francisco, the Justices should “make clear that the administrative record, the extra-record evidence, and the Hofeller files do not, individually or together, provide any basis for setting aside the Secretary’s decision on the grounds that it violates principles of equal protection.” \n\nThe Supreme Court now faces the choice of taking the Justice Department up on this latest offer, which the Maryland plaintiffs, whose case isn’t formally before the Justices, have [decried](https://www.maldef.org/2019/06/maldef-statement-on-trump-administrations-request-for-the-supreme-court-to-rule-on-equal-protection-census-lawsuit/) as “an utter disregard for due process.” The Court, which is expected to rule in the case on Thursday, can decide that it [lacks the benefit of full briefing and arguments](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/06/census-case-john-roberts-bush-v-gore-tragedy.html) from both sides on a critical issue and let the lower courts hash it out. Or it can simply look the other way and rule however it planned to before the spectre of racism reached its doorstep. The choice is stark. And with the next decade of [congressional apportionment](https://www.census.gov/topics/public-sector/congressional-apportionment.html) and funding for various states with rich immigrant communities on the line, how the Justices choose will affect Americans’ views of whether the country’s highest court remains a nonpartisan arbiter of justice.","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1ea141e4c73c088d7973","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e1ea141e4c73c088d7973","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"U.S.

It’s right there, in Article I, Section 2, clause 3: For a government of the people to function, the people must be counted. The Founders wanted an “enumeration” to occur within three years of the first meeting of Congress, and then “within every subsequent Term of ten Years, in such Manner as they shall by Law direct.” A census, in other words.\n\n \n\nThat sounds straightforward, but, in 2018, the Trump Administration proposed adding a new question to the 2020 census. It’s a simple query, nine words long: “Is this person a citizen of the United States?” The Secretary of Commerce, Wilbur Ross, first suggested the change, at the urging of Steve Bannon, the former White House chief strategist, and it has since been met with widespread criticism. Six former directors of the Census Bureau, from both Republican and Democratic Administrations, have come out against the question. A federal judge in California deemed it unconstitutional; another, in New York, found that Ross’s proposal broke a “smorgasbord” of rules. Now the Supreme Court will weigh in.  \n\nThe census has not contained a question about citizenship for seventy years. As the Constitution states, the census is supposed to enumerate all *people* in the United States, not just all citizens. Only seven per cent of the people living in the U.S. are non-citizens, but the number of people living in households with a non-citizen is higher—fourteen per cent. (Among Asian-Americans and Latin-Americans, that figure rises to forty-five and forty-six per cent, respectively.) The Census Bureau’s chief scientist, John Abowd, said that adding a citizenship question would deter at least six hundred and thirty thousand households from completing the form, and a government estimate predicted that 6\\.5 million people might not be counted as a result. That sort of distortion would have enormous consequences. The census determines the distribution of seats in Congress and the Electoral College. It’s also used to apportion nearly a trillion dollars in federal spending, to fund schools, hospitals, and roads. If a segment of the population—whether an entire state or an ethnic community—is undercounted, its resources are diminished accordingly.\n\n \n\nThe Supreme Court prides itself on being apolitical, but this case has already provoked deep partisan feelings. This is precisely because the census is, more than it might seem, a mirror of our politics. It has always reflected the promise and prejudices of our country, and its story drives to the heart of the Constitution—indeed, to its very first three words. Who are we, the people?\n\n +++inline-recirc\n+++\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\n\nThat question was important to the Founders, who understood that a precise census was essential for any government of the people to work. Figuring out who lived here had not been not a priority before independence. During British rule, when a new king inherited the throne, the broad reaches of the realm were assessed crudely, and the population was determined through guesswork. In 1714, with the accession of King George I, His Majesty’s counters estimated 375,000 white and 58,000 black subjects in the American colonies. Native Americans were certainly present, but they were not considered subjects, and they went uncounted.\n\n \n\nDuring the American Revolution, the population shot up to about 2\\.75 million people, including half a million African-Americans. After independence, actuarial certainty remained elusive. It was not easy to track people who were perpetually moving west, away from the seat of government and the taxes they associated with it. Counting African-Americans was another challenge. In the earliest days of nationhood, under the Articles of Confederation, Southern states were delighted to count slave populations, because doing so would add to their electoral strength in Congress. But at other times they refused to count them—for example, when a federal tax was tied each state’s population. The compromise reached by the Constitution helped to preserve the Union, but at an egregious cost to democracy. African-Americans were to be counted as “three-fifths of all other persons,” an arrangement that inflated Southern clout and made it impossible to check the spread of slavery until the Civil War.\n\n \n\nStill, the Constitution was a stronger document than the Articles of Confederation, partly because of the census it instituted. The act of counting rooted a rootless people. On the first Monday in August, 1790, U.S. marshals began to fan across the continent, enumerating everyone they could see. It was hard work. There were few rules, and some states needed extensions—especially those that had trouble accepting federal authority, such as Rhode Island and South Carolina. In the early days, the findings were not even published; they were simply posted, in each district, “at two of the most public places&nbsp;.&thinsp;.&thinsp;.&nbsp;to remain for the inspection of all concerned.”\n\n \n\nThat first census was completed in eighteen months. Nearly four million people were counted, which raised the membership of the House of Representatives from sixty-five to a hundred and five. A French statistician was astonished. He declared that the United States was an unprecedented phenomenon, calling the new nation “a people who instituted the statistics of their country on the very day when they founded their government, and who regulated by the same instrument the census of inhabitants, their civil and political rights, and the destinies of the nation.”\n\n \n\nThe very act of asking questions led to more questions, and the census grew fatter each decade. In 1849, the responsibility for the census was removed from its original home, the State Department, and sent into the Department of Interior, which, at the time, was home to such a grab-bag of programs that it was known as the Great Miscellany. The 1850 census was a particular triumph: for the first time, it spanned the continent and tracked the restless inhabitants of California, which had been recently acquired. It required more than three thousand employees to tabulate the results and transport them back to Washington.\n\n \n\nBy 1850, the population of the U.S. had reached a staggering 23,191,876—considerably more than England’s population (fifteen million). Size mattered to Americans, who could not help seeing growth as a sign of divine favor.  Walt Whitman, in his poem “Year of Meteors,” found something lyrical in the dry information being culled across the country. “I would sing in my copious song your census returns of The States,” he wrote, not very poetically. He was far from alone; in the beleaguered early months of the Civil War, Lincoln took solace in predicting an eventual U.S. population of two hundred and fifty million.\n\n \n\nWith the North’s victory, the three-fifths rule was finally eliminated, which, paradoxically, gave more power to the South, since it could now count the entirety of its population. The Fourteenth Amendment stated that the allocation of House seats was to rely on “the whole number of persons in each State”—a reading that has been supported by the Supreme Court ever since. The enumerators went out again in 1870 and 1880, but the task of processing census data was increasingly becoming a headache for civil servants. Sometimes it took almost a full decade to tabulate the results—at which point, of course, it was time for a new census to begin. The questions just kept flowing. Here is one example, from the 1880 form, which shows the census burrowing into the land itself: \n\n 1. *State; county; town*.  \n 2. *What proportion of the land devoted to grain-raising is*  \n*Hilly?  \nRolling?  \nLevel, alluvial or bottom land?*\n 3. *What is the prevailing kind of soil (as clay, loam, alluvial, black prairie, etc.)?*\n 4. *What is the character of the subsoil?*\n\n\n+++feature-small\n[#image: /photos/5cc8be0cd6b46f0b290e05ae]||||||\n+++\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\n\nWith the 1890 census looming, the Census Bureau was desperate for a faster way to count. In 1888, it held a contest: using samples of population statistics from St. Louis, it asked challengers to invent new ways of processing data. To general amazement, a twenty-eight-year-old former census employee named Herman Hollerith won easily, with an invention called the electric tabulating machine. One part of the contest asked the candidates to divide the data into categories. It took the second- and third-place competitors forty-four and a half hours and fifty-five and a half hours, respectively. Hollerith’s machine did the same task in five and a half hours.\n\n \n\nHollerith, the son of a German immigrant, grew up in Buffalo, tinkering with machines. He especially liked trains—he had already pioneered an “electro air brake” for them—and it was this passion that led to his idea for tabulation. He knew, from his census work, that it took too long for an enumerator to write out answers by hand, and he had noticed how quickly train conductors could punch passenger tickets as they moved through a crowded car. He reasoned that a device could record the census in a similar way.\n\n \n\nAfter trying a few different models, Hollerith settled upon a long card, approximately six and a half inches by three and a quarter inches, as the best vehicle for the vast amount of information he was processing. He started calling them “punch cards,” because his device tabulated data by punching holes through pre-printed symbols on the cards. These holes represented every point of information on the census: country of national origin, age, marital status, general health, languages spoken. Suddenly, the most exquisitely sensitive points of identity could be instantly noted and calibrated. Race had not disappeared, of course; a world of meaning was spelled out in the upper-left section of the card, where a few fractions of an inch separated the symbols for white (“W”), black (“B”), mulatto (“Mu”), quadroon (“Qd”), and octoroon (“Oc”) Americans.\n\n\nHollerith’s tabulator was a triumph. The 1890 census was by far the largest yet designed; it asked more questions than ever before and deployed enough enumerators (46,804) to constitute a decent army. Those enumerators were supplied with twenty-five million population schedules, weighing more than three hundred tons. They sent back sixty-two million punch cards, all the same size and machine-readable. An experienced tabulation clerk could process eighty punch cards per minute. This new technology led to another huge census, the results of which added up to 21,410 pages. Thanks to Hollerith and his invention, it was the most detailed statistical portrait of the United States that had ever been created.\n\n \n\nBut the 1890 Census did not stop there. It also introduced large-scale data processing to a world that was hungry for it. Following his triumph, Hollerith pursued other ventures, including a census of Russia (the czars had not condescended to count their people since 1851), and an immense data project for the New York Central Railroad. His energies were also drawn to the private sector, and Hollerith founded the Tabulating Machine Company, which merged with other manufacturing companies to form the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company. In 1924, it was renamed International Business Machines, or I.B.M. \n\n+++feature-small\n[#image: /photos/5cc8c66fb36101408ccebf2a]||||||\n+++\n\nHollerith had solved the processing problem, but he had not quite solved the issue of where to store all of the paper that was needed in the pre-digital era. The first ten censuses, from 1790 to 1880, had been bound into books, which cumulatively added up to 4,597 volumes. But the 1890 Census was simply too big to bind; it was five times larger than all the previous censuses combined. The population schedules alone would have added up to thirty thousand volumes. The chief clerk of the census predicted that it would require a seven-thousand-foot shelf  to store them all.\n\n \n\nFinding more than a mile of empty shelf space was difficult, even in a city that was already known for its bureaucracy. So the pile sat around, sparking no joy among the officials charged with its safekeeping. It sprawled across so many pages that copies could not be sent around the country, as earlier censuses had been. Only one copy existed, and it spilled over into different buildings—the Pension Bureau, the Patent Office, and a building called Marini’s Hall. In 1913, it was moved to a new Commerce Department building, where it was consigned to a basement storage area, adjacent to a boiler room. The papers were arranged on narrow pine shelves, in cardboard packages wrapped with twine. The shelves stood very close to each other, only twenty inches apart. The space was also very hot—more than ninety degrees when the boiler was running.  \n\nOn the afternoon of January 10, 1921, an employee noticed smoke coming through openings around the pipes that ran from the boiler room into the file room. The building was evacuated, and firemen were called. The next morning, investigators found charred records floating in ankle-deep water. They believed that the census might have spontaneously combusted. The census director estimated that twenty-five per cent of the records were gone; half of what remained was damaged. The greatest effort in history to tell a nation’s story had gone up in a puff of smoke.\n\n \n\nIn the wake of the fire, the government began to reassess its responsibility to the past. In an op-ed, the Washington *Post* argued that new steps were needed to protect the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution, which were then kept in wooden cabinets at the old State Department. The idea of a National Archives also emerged in response to the disaster. The remains of the 1890 Census, meanwhile, were placed in an old brewery, where they lingered for another decade. Congress authorized their destruction on February 21, 1933, the day after President Herbert Hoover laid the cornerstone for the Archives.\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\n\nTime is now running short before the 2020 census, our twenty-fourth, will begin. It’s possible that it could be a unifying experience. More likely, it will be bitterly contested, like every other aspect of nationhood. It will also be the most digital census in U.S. history, conducted mostly online and facilitated by enumerators guided by apps. Herman Hollerith would have surely embraced the speed and accuracy that these technologies provide. But they also incite certain fears—that a foreign power might try to hack the result, or that the system will fail for its own reasons. In 2016, a high-tech census crashed in Australia. Thanks to chronic underfunding of the Census Bureau, the census’s new tools have not been rigorously tested. For the fiscal year 2019, the Administration asked Congress to provide four hundred million dollars less to the Bureau than it received in 2009.\n\n \n\nStill, we have no choice but to honor the precise instructions of the Founders. They knew that self-government begins with self-understanding. Accounting for every person in the nation was a matter of principle; no one would have blamed the Washington Administration if it had paused before the first count, in 1790, to deal with more pressing problems. But the nation went ahead with the enumeration, and a government of the people was established. For it to endure, we must once again ask who we are.  \n\n\n\n\n","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1e9c2396212cbb9fcb74","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Census","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"census"},{"id":"5c2e1c767e716b454591ad9c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Immigration","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"immigration"},{"id":"5c2e1c762bfcc72cd92d051d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Donald Trump","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"donald-trump"}],"sections":[{"id":"5907ef01ebe912338a371720","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Culture Desk","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"culture-desk"}]},"channel":"Culture","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"5910a8b06c4c222f03a82ea5","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"","canonicalUrl":"http://www.newyorker.com/contributors/ted-widmer","email":"","name":"Ted Widmer","socialMedia":[],"title":"Ted Widmer is a distinguished lecturer at the Macaulay Honors College of the City University of New York and a senior fellow at the Carnegie Council for Ethics in International Affairs."}]},"dek":"The simple act of enumeration created data processing, led to the establishment of the National Archives, and rooted a rootless people.

The Census Bureau\ntabulates the over-all population, not just that of citizens, and its\nresults have far-reaching consequences, affecting the allocation of\nfederal resources and the apportionment of congressional seats. The\nsenators wanted a law requiring that respondents be asked whether they\nare American citizens, so that congressional districts could be redrawn.\nWithout such a change, Vitter said, “States that have large populations\nof illegals would be rewarded.” Other states, like his own, he said,\nwere being “penalized.” The subtext was that the Democrats, who tend to\nbe prominent in areas with high concentrations of immigrants, were\ngaining an advantage. The measure fell short of the necessary votes, as\nit did when Vitter proposed it again, in 2014 and in 2016. But his\nefforts reflected a persistent partisan logic. Now, on the eve of the\n2020 census, it has reëmerged.\n\nOn Monday, the Department of Commerce announced that it was adding a\ncitizenship question to the 2020 census. According to the Trump\nAdministration, this step is “necessary for the Department of Justice to\nprotect voters.” The Justice Department had requested the change in\nDecember, on the grounds that it needed to better enforce Section 2 of\nthe Voting Rights Act, which is designed to prevent violations of voting\nrights. It was an odd claim: in 2013, when the Supreme Court struck down\npart of the Voting Rights Act, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, then a\nsenator from Alabama, called the decision “good news&nbsp;.&thinsp;.&thinsp;.&nbsp;for the South.” A\nraft of state voter-suppression laws targeting minority voters followed,\nincluding in Texas, which passed a voter-I.D. law that a federal judge\nlater found to be racially discriminatory. During the Obama\nAdministration, the federal government filed a lawsuit against the\nstate, but last year Sessions decided to drop it. “The idea that this\nquestion is being added to the census to protect minority voting rights\nso that the lines can be redrawn in a fair way is just too absurd to be\nbelieved,” Rick Hasen, an election-law expert at the University of\nCalifornia, Irvine, told me.\n\nThis week’s announcement caused an immediate outcry. Six former heads of\nthe Census Bureau wrote to Wilbur Ross, the Commerce Secretary,\nregistering their “deep concern,” and twelve states, including\nCalifornia and New York, said that they plan to sue the federal\ngovernment over the move. Adding the citizenship question, Eric\nSchneiderman, the New York Attorney General, said, “will create an\nenvironment of fear and distrust in immigrant communities that would\nmake impossible both an accurate census and the fair distribution of\nfederal tax dollars.” He was reiterating a point that’s been made,\nrepeatedly, by demographers, civil-rights advocates, and current and\nformer government officials. Last November, a researcher at the Census\nBureau named Mikelyn Meyers reported that there was an “unprecedented\nground swell in confidentiality and data-sharing concerns among\nimmigrants or those who live with immigrants.” In a [presentation](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4424705-Census-Confidentiality-Presentation.html) before the bureau’s National Advisory Committee, she described the\npanicked responses of immigrants who were afraid to answer survey\nquestions in the current political climate, due to fears about\ndeportation. “This behavior was an extreme departure from behavior that\nwe have seen in the past,” she [said](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-immigration-census/u-s-officials-worry-immigrant-fears-could-make-census-inaccurate-idUSKBN1DU2U7). “This seems to be related to questions of legal residency or the\nperception that certain groups are not welcome.” By adding a citizen\nquestion to the census, the federal government may scare off residents\nfrom participating, and thus alter the results; that, in turn, could\nshort-change future federal funding, and, if it caused district lines to\nbe redrawn, [cost](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/01/16/trump-california-census-342116) Democrats congressional seats.\n\nRoss, in his announcement, claimed that there was no solid evidence that\nthe response rate would drop under the newly adopted policy, but the\nreal burden is on him to explain why such a dramatic change is worth the\nrisk. “When you do this once every ten years, for three hundred and\nforty million people, you’ve got to get it right,” one demographer [told](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/27/us/census-citizenship-question.html) the *Times*. The last time the government asked whether respondents were\ncitizens was in 1950. The question has come up since then, but only as\npart of a canvas called the American Community Survey, which is\nconducted on a rolling basis and has a smaller sample size. The results\nof this survey are widely seen as being sufficient to account for both\nthe immigrant and the voting populations. “The courts are not complaining\nthere’s a data problem,” Hasen told me.\n\nSo, who *is* complaining? One person seems to be John Gore, the acting\nhead of the civil-rights division of the Justice Department. According\nto an [investigation by ProPublica](https://www.propublica.org/article/john-gore-trump-appointee-citizenship-question-census),\nlate last year Gore drafted a proposal to add the citizenship question\nto the census. An attorney formerly with the firm Jones Day, Gore has\nbeen [involved](http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/01/trumps-top-civil-rights-pick-has-bad-record-on-civil-rights.html) in Republican redistricting efforts for years in states such as\nVirginia, South Carolina, Florida, and New York. He has also defended\nRepublican-backed voter-I.D. laws, including one effort, in 2012, to\npurge the Florida voting rolls of non-citizens, which had the effect of\ncancelling the registrations of some eligible voters, who were assumed\nto be foreign. An [analysis](http://www.tampabay.com/news/politics/national/hispanics-democrats-biggest-groups-on-floridas-list-of-potential/1229860) conducted by the Miami *Herald* found that “Hispanic, Democrat, and\nindependent-minded voters are the most likely to be targeted in a state\nhunt to remove thousands of non-citizens,” whereas “whites and\nRepublicans are disproportionately the least likely to face the threat\nof removal.” The justification usually given for such measures is that\nineligible voters might otherwise cast ballots illegally to sway the\noutcome of elections. Researchers and academics have categorically [refuted](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/trump-and-the-truth-the-rigged-election) these claims, and several state Republican officials have even [admitted](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/17/us/some-republicans-acknowledge-leveraging-voter-id-laws-for-political-gain.html) to drumming up the specter of voter fraud as a way to gain an edge over\nDemocrats.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has taken up the argument for a combination of\npersonal and political reasons. After he lost the popular vote, in 2016,\nhe claimed that three to four million undocumented immigrants had voted\nfor Hillary Clinton. (“I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions\nof people who voted illegally,” he tweeted.) Once in office, to lend\ncredence to his claims of mass voter fraud, Trump created the\nPresidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity, naming\nVice-President Mike Pence and Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach to\nhead it. It disbanded in January, having proved nothing.\n\nIn the meantime, Republican officials sought to make examples of\nimmigrants who had voted illegally, even if they’d done so unknowingly.\nLast year, in Texas, a thirty-nine-year-old mother of four from Mexico,\nwho had voted in 2012 and 2014—because, as a green-card holder, she\nthought she could—was [sentenced](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/10/us/illegal-voting-gets-texas-woman-8-years-in-prison-and-certain-deportation.html) to eight years in prison; if her legal appeal fails, she will be\ndeported after serving her time. In Kansas, a Peruvian mother of three\nwho also had a green card voted in a local school-board election more\nthan a decade ago, without realizing that she was not allowed to, and\nwas [deported](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/immigration/grandmother-deported-voter-fraud-leaves-u-s-tears-n789766) after years of court battles. Isolated examples like these were supposed\nto be the “tip of the iceberg,” in the words of Kris Kobach, who has\nstaked his [career](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/13/magazine/the-man-behind-trumps-voter-fraud-obsession.html) on devising onerous voter-I.D. requirements to combat a nonexistent\nproblem. Earlier this month he was in federal court, in Kansas,\ndefending himself against a lawsuit brought by the American Civil\nLiberties Union on behalf of the League of Women Voters and five Kansas\nvoters. The groups argued that a 2011 law that he enforced in the state,\nwhich required that voters show proof of citizenship, may have cost up\nto thirty-five thousand eligible voters their ability to cast ballots in\nlocal, state, and federal races. A verdict is expected next month, but\nthe trial was a disaster for Kobach, who [presented](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2018/03/kris-kobach-just-got-humiliated-in-federal-court/) questionable statistics and relied on cartoonishly incompetent experts.\n\nWhat’s ultimately most striking about the Trump Administration’s efforts\nto retool the census is the transparency of its motives. They aren’t\njust political but existential. The new census question marks a return\nto a policy from the middle part of the twentieth century, which is\nroughly where the Administration’s immigration policies are designed to\ntake us, too. For the first time in decades, an American President wants\nto halve the number of immigrants who come to this country legally each\nyear. The model that Trump and his advisers seem to have in mind is that\nof the period prior to 1965, when immigration laws expanded to admit\nmore immigrants from an increasingly diverse range of non-European\ncountries. Since then, tens of millions of people have come to the\nUnited States to join the work force and start families. Their children\n(and their grandchildren) are citizens, who study in local schools and\ndepend on local, state, and federal resources. There’s no more obvious\nsign of disdain for these lives than to accept that, when the government\ntakes stock of who counts in the United States, they may not be included.","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1e9c2396212cbb9fcb74","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Census","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"census"},{"id":"5c2e1d7b397f5b30646d070d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Census Bureau","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"census-bureau"},{"id":"5c2e1c9a36cecf401921420a","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Voter Suppression","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"voter-suppression"},{"id":"5c2e1c767e716b454591ad9c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Immigration","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"immigration"}],"sections":[{"id":"5907f159ebe912338a3717d7","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Daily Comment","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"daily-comment"}]},"channel":"","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"590a0738fba4e90c8d8d92ff","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Jonathan Blitzer is a staff writer at *The New Yorker*.

Another recent Espionage Act [indictment](https://www.justice.gov/usao-edva/pr/former-intelligence-analyst-charged-disclosing-classified-information) has generated less controversy, presumably because its target is not a publisher but a government insider. Daniel Everette Hale, a former Air Force intelligence analyst, is alleged to have supplied classified documents to “an online news outlet”—apparently the Intercept, known for its aggressive reporting about war.\n\nHale provided intelligence support for U.S. drone strikes while he was deployed in Afghanistan, during the Obama Administration. Some of the documents he allegedly disclosed concerned strikes in Afghanistan and the Horn of Africa. The Intercept [published](https://theintercept.com/drone-papers/the-assassination-complex/) the documents in the fall of 2015, at a time when U.S. drone strikes were especially controversial and Administration officials were contending that the strikes were lawful, necessary, and surgically precise. Hale [believed](https://theintercept.com/drone-papers/the-assassination-complex/) that the strikes were counterproductive and immoral, and that Americans had a right to know how the military was deciding whom to kill.\n\nThe Espionage Act is more than a century old, and its use as a tool for the suppression of speech crucial to the democratic process is not at all new. During the First World War, some two thousand people were prosecuted under the act for their opposition to the draft and the war, many of them for political speech that we would recognize today as fully protected by the First Amendment. In the nineteen-seventies, the government charged Daniel Ellsberg under the act for supplying the Pentagon Papers, a classified study of U.S. involvement in Vietnam, to the Washington *Post* and the New York *Times*. The government was forced to abandon the prosecution after it came to light that the F.B.I. had unlawfully tapped Ellsberg’s phone and that agents of the White House had broken into the office of his psychiatrist.\n\nThroughout the twentieth century, though, only one person was convicted under the Espionage Act for supplying information to the press. Samuel Loring Morison, a Navy intelligence analyst, was charged in 1984 with providing classified photographs to *Jane’s Defence Weekly.* The photos showed a next-generation Soviet aircraft carrier being assembled at a construction yard. Morison was convicted, but President Bill Clinton pardoned him, in 2001.\n\nSenator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, who wrote powerfully of the corrosive effect of official secrecy, was among many who advocated for Morison’s pardon. He argued that Morison had been convicted for “an activity which has become a routine aspect of government life: leaking information to the press in order to bring pressure to bear on a policy question.” Moynihan’s observation provided a complement to an argument that Max Frankel, the *Times’* Washington bureau chief, had made in the Pentagon Papers case. If the press did not publish government secrets, Frankel wrote, “there could be no adequate diplomatic, military and political reporting of the kind our people take for granted, either abroad or in Washington, and there could be no mature system of communication between the Government and the people.”\n\nThe George W. Bush Administration pursued several government insiders for leaking classified information, but it was the Obama Administration that normalized the use of the Espionage Act against journalists’ sources. Among its targets were Jeffrey Sterling, a former C.I.A. officer, who was sentenced to three and a half years for supplying the *Times* with classified information about U.S. efforts to disrupt Iran’s nuclear program; Donald Sachtleben, a former F.B.I. agent who was sentenced to three and a half years for providing the Associated Press with information about a foiled terrorist plot in Yemen; and Chelsea Manning, a former military-intelligence analyst who was sentenced to thirty-five years for providing Assange’s WikiLeaks with hundreds of thousands of pages of classified government documents. President Barack Obama commuted Manning’s sentence, in 2017—but only after she had served about seven years in prison. All told, the Obama Administration prosecuted eight people under the Espionage Act for leaking sensitive information to the media, more than all previous Administrations combined.\n\nThe Trump Administration is building on this foundation. Early in 2017, [President Trump](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/donald-trump) [complained](https://static01.nyt.com/files/2018/us/politics/20180419-james-comey-memos.pdf) to his F.B.I. director, [James Comey](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/james-comey), that sensitive information relating to his calls with foreign leaders had found its way into the media. Comey agreed to speak with the Attorney General, [Jeff Sessions](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/jeff-sessions), about pursuing leakers more aggressively, and said that he himself “was eager to find leakers and would like to nail one to the door as a message.” Later that year, Sessions told Congress that the Justice Department was engaged in twenty-seven investigations into classified leaks—a dramatic escalation over previous years. In the two and a half years since Trump complained to Comey, the Justice Department has indicted three people under the Espionage Act for providing information of public concern to the press. One of them, Reality Leigh Winner, was indicted for allegedly disclosing information concerning Russia’s efforts to interfere in the 2016 elections. Another, Terry Albury, the only African-American F.B.I. field agent in Minnesota, was charged with revealing information about the F.B.I.’s surveillance and infiltration of the Somali-American community. Hale was the third.\n\nOn one level, the logic of these indictments is easy to understand. The government needs to be able to protect its secrets, and it couldn’t if every employee and contractor felt empowered to decide which secrets should be disclosed. The problem with its increasing reliance on the Espionage Act to sanction insiders who reveal secrets to the press is that the act [collapses all of the distinctions](https://www.cjr.org/watchdog/daniel-hale-intercept-leakers.php) that should matter in those cases. It draws no distinction between insiders who share information with foreign intelligence services and those who share it with the media, or between those who intend to harm the United States and those who intend to inform the public about the abuse of government power. The act doesn’t admit of the possibility of secrets that are illegitimate, or widely known, or no longer sensitive, instead treating all disclosures of “information relating to the national defense” as subject, at least in theory, to the harshest penalties. The act is blind to the possibility that the public’s interest in learning of government incompetence, corruption, or criminality might outweigh the government’s interest in protecting a given secret. It is blind to the difference between whistle-blowers and spies. The government’s now-routine use of the Espionage Act against journalists’ sources suggests that it, too, has lost sight of these distinctions.\n\nIt is surely true that unauthorized disclosures to the press have sometimes caused harm. It is also true, however, as Frankel intimated in the Pentagon Papers case, and Moynihan in the Morison case, that without whistle-blowers the concept of accountable government would be a charade. Consider just the past twenty years. The abuses at [Abu Ghraib](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2004/05/10/torture-at-abu-ghraib) and [Guantánamo](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/guantanamo-bay), the torture of prisoners in C.I.A. black sites, the warrantless wiretapping of Americans’ phone calls, the scandalous dysfunction of the government’s watch lists, even the extent of foreign interference in the 2016 election—we would know far less, or nothing at all, about these topics if we had been dependent on the government’s official disclosures, which were often partial, selective, or simply false. \n\nHale’s case is illustrative. When Hale approached the Intercept, the military and the C.I.A. were carrying out drone strikes in multiple countries, including Afghanistan, Pakistan, Somalia, Yemen, and Libya. According to human-rights researchers and journalists who had documented strikes and interviewed survivors, the strikes had killed several thousand people, many of them noncombatants, and some of them children. In public statements, though, government officials contested these accounts, even [denying](https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/12/world/asia/12drones.html) that there had been any civilian casualties at all. The documents supplied by Hale allowed the Intercept to report—with evidence—that many of the people killed in drone strikes were not targets, that many of the targets were not terrorists, that many of the strikes were predicated on evidence that was thin and unreliable, and that, as to the body counts, the government was assuming, without any basis, that bystanders were “enemies killed in action.” Little of this would have been surprising to Afghans, Yemenis, and others in whose countries the drones were operating, but, at a moment when U.S. government officials were engaged in a campaign of propaganda and misdirection, these stories supplied Americans with the facts they needed to understand and evaluate government policy.\n\nSafeguarding the public’s right to know requires protecting not just journalists and publishers but sources as well. In recent years, some press-freedom advocates have [urged the courts](https://fas.org/sgp/jud/albury-amicus.pdf) to afford government insiders charged under the Espionage Act an opportunity to argue that the public’s interest in learning the information they disclosed outweighed the government’s interest in protecting it. In an era in which the President has trouble differentiating journalists from “enemies of the people,” it may be up to the courts, and the people themselves, to insist on differentiating whistle-blowers from spies.","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c92397f5b30646d0612","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e1c92397f5b30646d0612","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Freedom

On Thursday, the Justice Department [announced](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/23/us/politics/assange-indictment.html) that it was charging the WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange under the Espionage Act, for his connection to the leak of some seven hundred and fifty thousand confidential military and diplomatic documents, in 2010\\. The indictment of Assange is an offensive on the First Amendment that is as banal as it is blunt.\n\nLet’s get the “I disapprove” part out of the way first. Assange is a fundamentally unappealing protagonist. He keeps terrible political company. He is, apparently, [terrible company](https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-latin-america-47956607/assange-smeared-faeces-in-ecuador-embassy-says-president) himself. In his writing and interviews, he comes across as power-crazed and manipulative. Most important, when he published leaked classified documents, he shared information that exposed people to danger. He is the perfect target precisely because he is unsympathetic. One has to hold one’s nose while defending Assange—and yet one must defend Assange.\n\nThe use of the Espionage Act to prosecute Assange is an attack on the First Amendment. Carrie DeCell, an attorney with the Knight First Amendment Institute, summed up the threat in a Twitter [thread](https://twitter.com/cmd_dc/status/1131719320814399488) on Thursday. “The government argues that Assange violated the Espionage Act by soliciting, obtaining, and then publishing classified information,” she wrote. “That’s exactly what good national security and investigative journalists do every day.”\n\nThe government has argued that Assange is not a journalist. Most journalists would probably agree: the indiscriminate publication of classified information (or any other information, for that matter), with neither a narrative nor regard for people’s safety, is not journalism in any conventional understanding of the word. But journalism—unlike, say, medicine, law, or architecture—is a profession that any person can practice. There are no licensing or education requirements, and we journalists generally think that this is a good thing: the public can decide which journalists are worth reading or watching, and the law can intervene in those rare cases when journalism causes harm. The last thing we want the U.S. government, or any government, to do is to start deciding who is and who is not a journalist. “For the most part, the charges against him broadly address the solicitation, receipt, and publication of classified information,” DeCell tweeted. “These charges could be brought against national security and investigative journalists simply for doing their jobs, and doing them well.”\n\nLike many [Trumpian](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/donald-trump) attacks on democracy, this one is novel but rooted in a long devolution of American institutions—it is a leap, but from a running start. Government use of law against speech [goes back](https://www.cjr.org/the_media_today/julian_assange_espionage_act.php?utm_source=CJR+Daily+News&utm_campaign=d20ab25905-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2018_10_31_05_02_COPY_01&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_9c93f57676-d20ab25905-174321773) at least to the George W. Bush Administration. Prosecutions [ramped up](https://theintercept.com/2018/01/03/my-life-as-a-new-york-times-reporter-in-the-shadow-of-the-war-on-terror/) under [Barack Obama](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/barack-obama). Prosecutions, however, focussed on whistleblowers and leakers; journalists, who, like the *Times* reporter James Risen, could be called up as witnesses, were targeted indirectly. But journalism has not been collateral damage in this battle—it has been the target. The Trump Administration has made that clear by jumping the fence that the Obama Administration had merely approached and charging Assange, under the Espionage Act, for practices typical of journalists.\n\nIt stands to reason that an Administration that considers the press an “enemy of the people” would launch this attack. In attacking the media, it is attacking the public. The First Amendment, after all, doesn’t exist to protect the right of Assange, or me, or anyone else to say whatever we want. It exists to protect the public’s access to whatever we have to say, should the public find it of interest.\n\n","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1dad4a08312cd3aa6d5c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Julian Assange","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"julian-assange"},{"id":"5c2e1dad2396212cbb9fcab1","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"WikiLeaks","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"wikileaks"},{"id":"5c2e1ca07e716b454591add9","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Espionage","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"espionage"},{"id":"5c2e1dbe41c92e2c9b85db78","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"First Amendment","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"first-amendment"},{"id":"5c2e1c842396212cbb9fc9a8","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Journalism","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"journalism"}],"sections":[{"id":"59ef6620c6604764e97c762c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Our Columnists","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"our-columnists"}]},"channel":"News","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"5910a6e62e2e17730741c6b7","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Masha Gessen began contributing to *The New Yorker* in 2014 and became a staff writer in 2017\\.

An agent named Justin C. Garrick told her that he was there to investigate the possible mishandling of classified information and asked if they could “sit down” and “kind of go over what’s going on.” Winner let him and his colleagues inside. “Definitely here to, um, comply,” she said. A little more than an hour later, she had confessed to providing the media with classified documents that described Russia’s attempts to hack state-election systems during the 2016 Presidential race. She was arrested that evening and sentenced to five years in prison in August of 2018\\.\n\nLast December, while Winner was awaiting trial (she eventually pleaded guilty), the playwright Tina Satter discovered the transcript of Winner’s interrogation, which the F.B.I. had released, in court filings, a few months before. She began reading and couldn’t put it down. “I had never read anything like that,” Satter told me. “Literally, I was, like, ‘*This is a play*.’ ” Satter is the founder and director of the experimental theatre company Half Straddle. Her company has turned the transcript into a play titled “Is This a Room? Reality Winner Verbatim Transcription,” which follows the original document verbatim and runs a little more than an hour. It ran at the Kitchen earlier this month. \n\nSince 2008, Half Straddle has staged ten plays by Satter: dark, funny productions that draw their jittery energy from the linguistic particulars and petty hierarchies of insular worlds. Satter finds roominess in claustrophobic dialogue by letting complex relationships unfurl through sparse exchanges that are peppered with well-placed “likes” and “uhs.” When she first started writing plays, she was drawn to the neo-realist works of playwrights like Richard Maxwell. Previous works of hers have typically revolved around “girlhood-adjacent” subcultures, such as dance troupes, sports teams, or close-knit teen-age siblings. Satter was very close with her sister when they were growing up, and both were serious field-hockey players. That relationship and that sport were, she said, “ur-experiences” that she later tried to replicate in theatre. “They were these fully formed female worlds with everything you needed.” \n\nWhen Satter read the Winner transcript, she was reminded of “this kind of self-assured female character that is the heart of what I’m interested in.” Rather than wilt, Winner—who, one must assume, had a very good guess about why F.B.I. agents had shown up at her house—resists their questions by feeding them a series of alternative hypotheses to explain why they’ve been led to her on a tip. The agents break her down by asking her to repeat herself and by suddenly diverting to questions about Winner’s interests, which include speaking foreign languages (she is fluent in Dari, Farsi, and Pashto), fostering stray animals, and competitive powerlifting. Although Winner is not technically in custody, it’s obvious that she is intimidated, and Winner’s lawyers later argued that she should have been read her Miranda rights. (Non-custodial questioning sessions, like these, which the F.B.I. isn’t required to record, are controversial, since law-enforcement officers deliberately feign friendliness to get subjects to confess without informing them that they are suspected of a crime.) When Satter saw footage of the room where Winner was questioned—a tiny spare room in her house, usually left unused—the size of it awoke in her a kind of “primal” aversion, she told me. As Winner answers the agents’ questions, their conversation hovers in a surreal space: a friendly exchange that everyone knows is in service of something sinister. \n\nWinner possesses an unmistakable, authentic, and very endearing sense of humor, which radiates irrepressibly from the transcript’s center. When the agents show her a search warrant, which lists her height and weight, Winner cracks, “A hundred and fifty-four pounds? You guys flatter me.” She provides dutiful answers to their questions about her job at the N.S.A., but Winner’s charisma, wisecracking, and facility at parrying the agents’ questions show the precariousness of her role as someone deeply embedded and yet inherently marginalized within the male-centered worlds of law enforcement and the military. (Winner served for six years as a linguist in the Air Force.) When the agents ask her about the weapons in her home, Winner rattles off three types of guns, including an AR-15, a revelation greeted with a blend of condescension and praise:\n\n> Agent Taylor: Is it pink?\n> \n> Winner: It’s pink. \n> \n> Agent Taylor: O.K.\n> \n> Winner: How did you know? [*Laughs.*]\n> \n> Agent Taylor: [*Laughs.*]\n> \n> Winner: Um, I have a Glock 9 under the bed.\n> \n> Agent Taylor: Okay.\n> \n> Winner: And a, uhm, a 15 gauge.\n> \n> Agent Taylor: You sound like my house. O.K.\n\nExchanges like these dazzle and repel. “You’re like, what *is* this conversation?” Satter said. “It doesn’t totally follow normal codes. It’s not this girl-against-the-wall interrogation thing.” She went on, “To me, the fact that there is all this humor that was staying there . . . it just gives it this richness.” \n\nDuring a rehearsal in November, Satter sat on the sidelines, in a leopard-print sweater and Nikes, fine-tuning the heightened quality that she wanted her actors to bring to their lines. “Unnatural, a *little* more unnatural!” she cooed. Except in “Seagull (Thinking of You),” her 2013 reimagining of Chekhov’s “The Seagull,” Satter has never used found text as the basis for her work. She felt that much of the Reality Winner play’s success would depend on finding a dramatic rise and fall in the script’s relentless circularity. “My main concern is I never want it to feel like it’s jumping around in time,” she told me. “If you are totally cold to the text, you might not understand it is sequential.” Indeed, the agents shift so abruptly from interrogation to chitchat that, when I read through the script for the first time, I assumed that Satter must have moved pieces of their conversation around. (She did not.)\n\n“I think that’s their technique,” Satter said. “To slowly disorient her, to keep the pressure on, to ask so many questions.” She and her actors were working on an early scene, in which the agents ask one another a series of “Who’s On First”-esque questions about the location of Winner’s cat. (“There’s a cat in the house. In the bed—where.” / “It was on the bed.” / “On the bed. O.K.” / “Or it *was* on the bed.” / “It’s . . .” / “It’ll maybe go under the bed at some point.”) “Weirdly overplay that!” Satter encouraged. She corrected herself: “We can *slightly* overplay it.”\n\nBecause Satter usually writes parts specifically for the actors in her company, one might assume that the inflexibility and dryness of a transcribed text would be cumbersome. But Satter was drawn to the choppy, stilted nature of transcribed speech, which, when her actors remain rigorously faithful to it, is surprisingly rich. In efforts to animate a transcribed interruption, the actors referred regularly to their scripts, to catch the complex order of operations. The sound designer, Sanae Yamada, wafted a series of audio cues through the room, giving an ominous backdrop to the posturing and occasional doltishness of the agents, which can often be quite funny. The three interrogators are played by Pete Simpson, T. L. Thompson, and Becca Blackwell—comedic performers who bring a kind of “slipperiness and jokiness” to the stock masculinity of their roles, Satter told me.\n\nWinner is played by the phenomenal actor Emily Davis, who bears a striking similarity to the real-life Winner: both are droll blondes with South Texas roots. The two even have a distant personal connection:  Davis’s mother is childhood friends with the reporter who has extensively covered Winner’s case in the Corpus Christi *Caller-Times*, Winner’s home-town paper. This interweaving of the transcript and her actors’ lives lent Satter a sense that the play is not just relevant to her political interests but personally relevant to those around her. “My gosh, Reality even looks like Emily,” Satter said. Winner has corresponded with Davis from jail, and both Satter and Davis have been in touch with Billie Winner-Davis, Winner’s mother. \n\nNone of Satter’s previous work has dealt directly with politics, and many of her prior productions contain fanciful song breaks and dance numbers. But, like many of her peers, Satter experienced a kind of whiplash when Trump was elected, and she began to feel conflicted about how her creative predilections intersected with her responsibilities as a citizen. “Starting in November of 2016, I felt the mandate had shifted,” she told me. “Do you stop everything? I mean, I went through all this. Do you stop making work? What do you do?” “Is This a Room?” isn’t entirely free of whimsy—the production required the services of a puppet-maker—but, in Winner, and in the “true surreality” of her story, Satter has found a way to address the current landscape while keeping her artistic instincts for outlandishness intact. “This tracks my daily questions—what does it *mean* to be a patriot?,” she said, noting that Winner herself, “this person at the nexus of all this,” still “doesn’t seem to have any answers.”\n\nThe actors took a break, and they descended sleepily into their phones to text and check the news. After a few quiet moments, Blackwell shrieked, “Manafort met with Assange in the Ecuadorian Embassy!” (The story was later called into question.) For a minute, no one seemed to know what to say. It was the kind of group silence that often greets a new headline, especially when it is excitedly delivered aloud—a very specific, very exhausted kind of overload, as listeners try to assemble a meaningful reaction to the ever-more bizarre. \n\n“That is wackadoo,” Blackwell supplied.\n\n“We are living in the upside down,” Thompson said.\n\n \n\nBlackwell stood to resume rehearsal, squaring off their shoulders to lean in toward Davis. They agreed with Thompson. “We will never go back.”\n\n","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c7636cecf40192141bd","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Theatre","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"theatre"},{"id":"5c2e1f6a397f5b30646d0895","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"National Security Agency (N.S.A.)","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"national-security-agency-nsa"},{"id":"5c2e1d5b7e716b454591ae82","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"F.B.I.","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"fbi"},{"id":"5c2e1d55e56e652c9027475c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Interrogations","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"interrogations"},{"id":"5c2e1e2d22d4972cd5b83469","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Leaks","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"leaks"}],"sections":[{"id":"5907ef01ebe912338a371720","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Culture Desk","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"culture-desk"}]},"channel":"Culture","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"5bbfb40272a78f2d0fa624f3","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"","email":"","name":"Lizzie Feidelson","socialMedia":[],"title":"Lizzie Feidelson is a writer and performer living in New York."}]},"dek":"","hed":"An F.B.I.

The agency was not ready to carry out such a large operation. Preparations that would typically take field officers six  to eight  weeks were compressed into a few days, and, because of Trump’s tweet, the officers would be entering communities that now knew they were coming. “It was a dumb-shit political move that will only hurt the agents,” John Amaya, a former deputy chief of staff at *ICE*{: .small}, told me. On Saturday, hours before the operation was supposed to start in ten major cities across the country, the President changed course, delaying it for another two weeks. \n\nOn Sunday, I spoke to an *ICE*{: .small} officer about the week’s events. “Almost nobody was looking forward to this operation,” the officer said. “It was a boondoggle, a nightmare.” Even on the eve of the operation, many of the most important details remained unresolved. “This was a family op. So where are we going to put the families? There’s no room to detain them, so are we going to put them in hotels?” the officer said. On Friday, an answer came down from *ICE*{: .small} leadership: the families would be placed in hotels while *ICE*{: .small} figured out what to do with them. That, in turn, raised other questions. “So the families are in hotels, but who’s going to watch them?” the officer continued. “What happens if the person we arrest has a U.S.-citizen child? What do we do with the children? Do we need to get booster seats for the vans? Should we get the kids toys to play with?” Trump’s tweet broadcasting the operation had also created a safety issue for the officers involved. “No police agency goes out and says, ‘Tomorrow, between four and eight, we’re going to be in these neighborhoods,’ ” the officer said. \n\nThe idea for the operation took hold in the White House last September, two months  after a federal judge had ordered the government to stop separating parents and children at the border. At the time, the number of families seeking asylum was rising steadily, and Administration officials were determined to toughen enforcement. A D.H.S. official told me that, in the months before the operation was proposed, “a major focus” of department meetings “was concern about the fact that people on the non-detained docket”—asylum seekers released into the U.S. with a future court date—“are almost never deported.” By January, a tentative plan had materialized. The Department of Justice developed  a “rocket docket” to prioritize the cases of asylum seekers who’d just arrived in the country and missed a court date—in their absence, the government could swiftly secure deportation orders against them. D.H.S. then created a “target list” of roughly twenty-five hundred immigrant family members across the country for deportation; eventually, the Administration aimed to arrest ten thousand people using these methods.   \n\nFrom the start, however, the plan faced resistance. The Secretary of D.H.S., [Kirstjen Nielsen](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/Kirstjen-Nielsen), argued that the arrests would be complicated to carry out, in part because American children would be involved. (Many were born in the U.S. to parents on the “target list.”) Resources were already limited, and an operation on this scale would divert attention from the border, where a humanitarian crisis was worsening by the day. The acting head of *ICE*{: .small}, Ron Vitiello, a tough-minded former Border Patrol officer, shared Nielsen’s concerns. According to the Washington [*Post*](https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/before-trumps-purge-at-dhs-top-officials-challenged-plan-for-mass-family-arrests/2019/05/13/d7cb91ce-75af-11e9-bd25-c989555e7766_story.html?utm_term=.f15a03ef399f), these reservations weren’t “ethical” so much as logistical: executing such a vast operation would be extremely difficult, with multiple moving pieces, and the optics could be devastating. Four months later, Trump effectively fired them. Vitiello’s replacement at *ICE*{: .small}, an official named Mark Morgan—who’s already been fired once by Trump and regained the President’s support after making a series of appearances on Fox News—subsequently announced that *ICE*{: .small} would proceed with the operation. \n\nLate last week, factions within the Administration clashed over what to do. The acting secretary of D.H.S., Kevin McAleenan, urged caution, claiming that the operation was a distraction and a waste of manpower. Among other things, a $4\\.5 billion funding bill to supply further humanitarian aid at the border has been held up because Democrats worried that the Administration would use the money for enforcement operations. McAleenan had been meeting with members of both parties on the Hill, and there appeared to be signs of progress, before the President announced the *ICE*{: .small} crackdown. According to an Administration official, McAleenan argued that the operation would also threaten a string of recent gains made by the President. The Trump Administration had just secured a [deal](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/how-trumps-tariff-threat-could-outsource-the-asylum-crisis-to-mexico) with the Mexican government to increase enforcement at the Guatemalan border, and it expanded a massive new program called Remain in Mexico, which has forced some ten thousand asylum seekers to wait indefinitely in northern Mexico. “Momentum was moving in the right direction,” the official said.\n\nOn the other side of the argument were Stephen Miller, at the White House, and Mark Morgan, at *ICE*{: .small}. In the days before and after Trump’s Twitter announcement, Morgan spoke regularly with the President, who was circumventing McAleenan, Morgan’s boss. In meetings with staff, Morgan boasted that he had a direct line to the President, according to the *ICE*{: .small} officer, who told me it was highly unusual for there to be such direct contact between the agency head and the White House. “It should be going to the Secretary, which I find hilarious, actually, because Morgan was already fired once by this Administration,” the officer said. \n\nOver the weekend, the President agreed to halt the operation. But it’s far from certain whether McAleenan actually got the upper hand. Officials in the White House authorized *ICE*{: .small} to issue a press release insinuating that someone had leaked important details about the operation and therefore compromised it. “Any leak telegraphing sensitive law-enforcement operations is egregious and puts our officers’ safety in danger,” an *ICE*{: .small} spokesperson said late Saturday afternoon. This was a puzzling statement given that it was Trump who first publicized the information about the operation. But the White House’s line followed a different script: some members of the Administration, as well as the former head of *ICE*{: .small}, Thomas Homan, were publicly accusing McAleenan of sharing information with reporters in an attempt to undermine the operation. \n\nFor Homan, his involvement in the Administration’s internal fight marked an unexpected return to the main stage. Last year, he resigned as acting head of *ICE*{: .small} after the Senate refused to confirm him to the post. Earlier this month, Trump announced, on Fox News, that Homan would be returning to the Administration as the President’s new border tsar, but Homan, who hadn’t been informed of the decision, has remained noncommittal. Still, according to the Administration official, Homan and the President talk by phone regularly. Over the weekend, Homan, who has since become an on-air contributor to Fox News, appeared on television to attack McAleenan personally. “You’ve got the acting Secretary of Homeland Security resisting  what *ICE*{: .small} is trying to do,” he said. \n\nMeanwhile, the President spent the weekend trying to leverage the delayed operation to pressure congressional Democrats. If they did not agree to a complete overhaul of the asylum system at the border, Trump said, he’d greenlight the *ICE*{: .small} operation once more. “Two weeks,” he tweeted, “and big Deportation begins.” At the same time, his Administration was under fire for holding immigrant children at a Border Patrol facility in Clint, Texas. Two hundred and fifty infants, children, and teen-agers have spent weeks in squalid conditions; they have been denied food, water, soap, and toothbrushes, and there’s limited access to medicine in the wake of flu and lice outbreaks. “If the Democrats would change the asylum laws and the loopholes,” Trump said, “everything would be solved immediately.” And yet, last week, when an Administration lawyer appeared before the Ninth Circuit to answer for the conditions at the facility, which were in clear violation of a federal agreement on the treatment of children in detention, she said that addressing them was not the government’s responsibility. Michelle Brané, of the Women’s Refugee Commission, told me, “The Administration is intentionally creating chaos at the border and detaining children in abusive conditions for political gain.” (On Monday, Customs and Border Protection transferred all but thirty children from the Clint facility; it isn’t yet clear where, exactly, they’ll go.)  \n\nPresident Obama was never popular among *ICE*{: .small}’s rank and file, but the detailed list of enforcement priorities he instituted, in 2014, which many in the agency initially resented as micromanagement, now seemed more sensible—and even preferable to the current state of affairs. The *ICE*{: .small} officer said, “One person told me, ‘I never thought I’d say this, but I miss the Obama rules. We removed more people with the rules we had in place than with all this. It was much easier when we had the priorities. It was cleaner.’ ” Since the creation of *ICE*{: .small}, in 2003, enforcement was premised on the idea that officers would primarily go after criminals for deportation; Trump, who views *ICE*{: .small} as a political tool to showcase his toughness, has abandoned that framework entirely. “I don’t even know what we’re doing now,” the officer said. “A lot of us see the photos of the kids at the border, and we’re wondering, ‘What the hell is going on?’ ” The influx of Central American migrants, the officer noted, has been an issue for more than a decade now, spanning three Presidential administrations. “No one built up the infrastructure to handle this, and now people are suffering at the border for it. They keep saying they were caught flat footed. That’s a bald-faced fucking lie.”

immigration negotiations between the United States and Mexico, the Mexican President, [Andrés Manuel López Obrador](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/06/25/a-new-revolution-in-mexico), organized a rally in Tijuana to celebrate an agreement that, he claimed, had averted a national catastrophe. Mexico would expand the terms of an existing arrangement with the U.S., called Remain in Mexico, while also dispatching the national guard to its southern border. In return, Donald Trump had agreed to suspend a round of tariffs that he’d threatened to impose on Mexican goods unless the country did more to limit the flow of migrants to the U.S. border. These tariffs “would have caused major damage to both economies,” López Obrador said; the Mexicans, in his telling, had stuck to their principles and set the American President straight. \n\nMeanwhile, north of the border, Trump was touting the “new deal with Mexico,” as though he’d just won the upper hand. It wasn’t immediately clear whether his pronouncement was more of the usual Trumpian bluster or if, in fact, he knew something else about where the talks were headed. “We got everything we wanted,” Trump said on CNBC. “If we didn’t have tariffs, we wouldn’t have made a deal with Mexico.” When critics pointed out that the concessions he’d wrested from the Mexicans seemed modest, he groused, on Twitter, “If President Obama made the deals that I have made, both at the Border and for the Economy&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. a National Holiday would be immediately declared.” Last week, apparently still dissatisfied with the media’s response, Trump pulled a one-page document from the pocket of his suit jacket while addressing reporters on the White House lawn. It contained the details of a “secret” deal his Administration had reached with Mexico, he said, although he refused to elaborate. “With that, Trump created a shit storm in Mexico,” a former Mexican government official told me. “Everyone wanted to know whether *AMLO*{: .small}”—López Obrador—“had disclosed the full extent of the negotiations.” \n\nOn Friday, as public criticism mounted in Mexico, the Mexican government revealed what it had been keeping under wraps. It was a “supplementary agreement” to the broader deal between the two countries in which Mexico would lay the groundwork for a policy that Trump has pursued since taking office. Known as a “safe third-country agreement,” it would allow the Trump Administration to turn away asylum seekers who have travelled through Mexico on their way to the U.S. border, on the grounds that they can pursue asylum in Mexico instead. In effect, such an agreement would outsource the U.S.’s [asylum crisis](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/donald-trumps-failure-to-address-the-real-crisis-at-the-border) to Mexico. \n\nAccording to the terms of the deal, the Mexican government has forty-five days to substantially reduce the number of Central American migrants reaching the U.S. border. If the U.S. finds the results to be “insufficient,” then “Mexico will take all necessary steps under domestic law to bring the agreement into force.” Under the circumstances, it’s nearly impossible to imagine that the Trump Administration would relent after forty-five days, regardless of the progress that the Mexicans will have made by then. “We’re beginning to understand something that it took me a while to fully grasp,” Marcelo Ebrard, Mexico’s foreign minister, said last week, in Mexico City. “Today, the government of the United States thinks that there shouldn’t be any migrants who arrive [in the U.S.] at all. That is their position.”  \n\nLast month, some hundred and forty thousand migrants were apprehended at the U.S. border, the vast majority of them seeking asylum. By law, they must be allowed to make their claims to American immigration agents, but the Trump Administration has already designed a raft of measures to bar their entry. Through a policy called “metering,” it has restricted the number of asylum seekers admitted each day at official ports of entry, creating a [bottleneck](https://www.newyorker.com/news/dispatch/the-long-wait-for-tijuanas-migrants-to-process-their-own-asylum-claims) in northern Mexico. Last December, the Department of Homeland Security instituted the Remain in Mexico plan—known officially as the Migrant Protection Protocols—which forced asylum seekers to wait indefinitely in Mexico while their cases moved through the backlogged U.S. immigration courts. To date, some ten thousand asylum seekers have been forcibly returned to Mexico under this arrangement, and Mexican authorities expect the number to grow to more than a hundred thousand by the end of the year. In Ciudad Juárez, which has received hundreds of Central American asylum seekers each day under Remain in Mexico, the director of the city’s largest migrant shelter told the Washington [*Post*](https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/the-american-dream-has-turned-into-hell-in-test-of-a-deterrent-juarez-plans-for-us-to-dump-thousands-of-migrants/2019/06/17/096380c6-8ef5-11e9-b08e-cfd89bd36d4e_story.html?utm_term=.af324277b068), “the city and the state, we’re not prepared.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. That could plunge us into a crisis.” \n\nIn theory, if [not always in practice](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-immigration-returns-exclusive/exclusive-asylum-seekers-returned-to-mexico-rarely-win-bids-to-wait-in-u-s-idUSKCN1TD13Z), the migrants returned under Remain in Mexico will have a chance to petition for asylum in the U.S. But, by the definition of a safe third-country agreement, asylum seekers travelling through Mexico would no longer be allowed to make their case to American authorities. By default, Mexico would become their final destination. Such a scenario would be highly controversial for legal and humanitarian reasons. For one thing, such an agreement is premised on the assumption that Mexico is a “safe” country in which migrants can seek asylum, even though the country has a well-documented [history](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-trump-administration-is-completely-unraveling-the-us-asylum-system) of mistreating migrants in its custody and of unlawfully turning them around at its southern border. The last few months have shown, on a small scale, what one likely outcome would be for tens of thousands of asylum seekers stuck in Mexico: a number of Central American asylum seekers in northern Mexico have already been killed and extorted by criminal cartels preying on their vulnerability. “If you’re going to pursue a safe third-country agreement, you have to be able to say ‘safe’ with a straight face,” Doris Meissner, the former commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, told me. \n\nAt the same time, there’s never been any political upside to a safe third-country agreement for the Mexican government. The Trump Administration has spent the last two years pushing for such an agreement, and two successive Mexican Presidential administrations—those of Enrique Peña Nieto and López Obrador—have refused. So what changed? It was the President’s threat of tariffs, someone familiar with the negotiations in Mexico told me. The Mexican economy [contracted](https://www.wsj.com/articles/mexico-warns-of-retaliation-for-u-s-tariffs-urges-talks-11559576566) in the early months of 2019, and the value of the peso has recently fallen. The tariffs Trump envisioned, which would begin at five per cent but could reach as high as twenty-five per cent by the fall, are a particularly bracing prospect at the current moment. “López Obrador is thinking of his legacy and how to avoid a catastrophe for the Mexican economy,” the person said. “If those tariffs went into effect, there would be a high risk of a major economic crisis, the likes of which Mexico has not seen for at least twenty-five years.”\n\nThe sense of alarm in the upper echelons of the Mexican government apparently overshadowed the possibility that Trump might be bluffing. It would hardly be the first time Trump levelled an empty threat, and a number of Congressional Republicans strongly opposed the President’s gambit. (Tariffs on Mexican goods would hurt the American economy, too.) Part of the brazenness of Trump’s position was that it upended decades of unwritten rules for how the two countries conducted bilateral talks. “Before this, the relationship between the U.S. and Mexico was much more compartmentalized,” the person told me. “Trade and commerce were kept separate from immigration and from security. Trump arrived and everything got contaminated.” In terms of Trump’s agenda, his brash tactics seem to be working. “He created a new, unprecedented pressure,” the person added. “Mexico is in a very precarious position.”\n\nStill, the Mexican government remains divided on the agreement, revealing deeper fault lines at the core of the current administration. The Interior Ministry, which has typically helmed immigration policy, was strongly opposed to the deal, as were some officials at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs—but Ebrard overruled them. He and López Obrador see the dispute as an international economic issue; in their view, according to two former Mexican officials, immigration policy may have to be sacrificed for the sake of the country’s relationship with the U.S. and, by extension, the fate of its economy. Key members of the Interior Ministry were excluded from the recent round of talks with the Americans, and the head of the country’s immigration program resigned on Friday. “There was a vacuum of power on immigration policy,” another former Mexican official told me. “Ebrard is not the most conservative person out there, but he does have personnel and allies in government to support him. The newer, more progressive people”—such as the former immigration head and the sub-secretary for human rights at the Interior Ministry—“do not.” \n\nThe terms of a deal are still months from being worked out, and the Mexican government is trying to buy itself time. Over the weekend, I spoke to someone with access to one set of preliminary details for what the safe third-country agreement between the U.S. and Mexico could look like. That version of the proposal would not apply to all asylum seekers travelling through Mexico, only to Guatemalans, who presently make up the largest share of migrants apprehended at the U.S. border. Mexico was trying to limit the reach of what the agreement might look like, according to the source, but avoiding it altogether no longer seemed possible. “They are trying to fight a safe third-country agreement, but they were left with no option but to consider it,” the person with knowledge of the negotiations said. The López Obrador administration told the Mexican Senate, which would still have to approve a sweeping new asylum deal with the U.S., that its negotiators did not understand the supplementary agreement to be binding. And in the last few days, the López Obrador government has further obscured matters by making references to a regional asylum overhaul that sounds like a safe third-country agreement but has been described in vaguer terms. “Ebrard will never say he wants or has accepted [a safe third-country agreement],” one of the former Mexican officials told me. “He has said  many times that the forty-five days are something he won to prevent it, to show things can work in other ways. But he’s clearly introducing the matter to the Mexican public and easing it in.”\n\nIf the Trump Administration has its way, it may be able to dramatically lower the number of people admitted into the U.S.—any version of a safe third-country agreement would insure as much, albeit at an incalculable moral and legal cost. Mexico is at a crossroads of its own. It has gone from a country that sent some two hundred and fifty thousand migrants a year to the U.S., at the turn of the century, to one that has become a “transit country” for families seeking asylum in the U.S. “Mexico wasn’t prepared to address this new face of immigration,” Maureen Meyer, of the Washington Office on Latin America, told me. “Mexico’s asylum agency continues to be grossly understaffed and underfunded,” at the same time that the country “has also increased immigration enforcement in response to U.S. pressure.” In 2015, for instance, Mexico deported more Central American migrants than the U.S. did. When López Obrador entered office, he vowed to welcome the region’s immigrants. Now, under threats from Trump, he is being forced to choose between his broader domestic agenda and his commitment to asylum seekers. It was telling that when the head of Mexico’s National Immigration Institute resigned last week, his replacement was the director of the federal prison system.","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c762bfcc72cd92d051d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Donald Trump","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"donald-trump"},{"id":"5c2e1c7be56e652c90274663","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"andres-manuel-lopez-obrador"},{"id":"5c2e1c7be56e652c90274665","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Asylum Seekers","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"asylum-seekers"},{"id":"5c2e1c7fb75f002c8941e477","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tariffs","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tariffs"},{"id":"5c2e1c7b36cecf40192141d4","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Mexico","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"mexico"}],"sections":[{"id":"590a02541c7a8e33fb390be1","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"News Desk","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"news-desk"}]},"channel":"News","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"590a0738fba4e90c8d8d92ff","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Jonathan Blitzer is a staff writer at *The New Yorker*.

The full text of Ocasio-Cortez’s tweet was “This administration has established concentration camps on the southern border of the United States for immigrants, where they are being brutalized with dehumanizing conditions and dying. This is not hyperbole. It is the conclusion of expert analysis.” Hackles were immediately raised, tweets fired, and, less than an hour and a half later, Representative Liz Cheney, of Wyoming, [tweeted](https://twitter.com/Liz_Cheney/status/1140988893627478018), “Please @AOC do us all a favor and spend just a few minutes learning some actual history. 6 million Jews were exterminated in the Holocaust. You demean their memory and disgrace yourself with comments like this.” A high-pitched battle of tweets and op-eds took off down the much travelled dead-end road of arguments about historical analogies. These almost never go well, and they always devolve into a virtual shouting match if the Holocaust, the Nazis, or Adolf Hitler is invoked. One side always argues that nothing can be as bad as the Holocaust, therefore nothing can be compared to it; the other argues that the cautionary lesson of history can be learned only by acknowledging the similarities between now and then.\n\n----------\n\n__Read:__ *[Isaac Chotiner](http://newyorker.com/contributors/isaac-chotiner)’s [interview with Warren Binford](https://www.newyorker.com/news/q-and-a/inside-a-texas-building-where-the-government-is-holding-immigrant-children), a lawyer disturbed by what she saw while interviewing immigrant children held in American detention facilities.*\n\n----------\n\nBut the argument is really about how we perceive history, ourselves, and ourselves in history. We learn to think of history as something that has already happened, to other people. Our own moment, filled as it is with minutiae destined to be forgotten, always looks smaller in comparison. As for history, the greater the event, the more mythologized it becomes. Despite our best intentions, the myth becomes a caricature of sorts. Hitler, or Stalin, comes to look like a two-dimensional villain—someone whom contemporaries could not have seen as a human being. The Holocaust, or the Gulag, are such monstrous events that the very idea of rendering them in any sort of gray scale seems monstrous, too. This has the effect of making them, essentially, unimaginable. In crafting the story of something that should never have been allowed to happen, we forge the story of something that couldn’t possibly have happened. Or, to use a phrase only slightly out of context, something that can’t happen here.\n\nA logical fallacy becomes inevitable. If this can’t happen, then the thing that *is* happening is not it. What we see in real life, or at least on television, can’t possibly be the same monstrous phenomenon that we have collectively decided is unimaginable. I have had many conversations about this in Russia. People who know Vladimir Putin and his inner circle have often told me that they are not the monsters that I and others have described. Yes, they have overseen assassinations, imprisonments, and wars, but they are not thoroughly terrible, my interlocutors have claimed—they are not like Stalin and his henchmen. In other words, they are not the monsters of our collective historical imagination. They are today’s flesh-and-blood monsters, and this makes them seem somehow less monstrous.\n\nAnything that happens here and now is normalized, not solely through the moral failure of contemporaries but simply by virtue of actually existing. Allow me to illustrate. My oldest son, who spent his early childhood in a Russian hospital, was for many years extremely small for his age. I spent useless hours upon hours in my study in Moscow, where we then lived, poring over C.D.C. growth charts. No matter how many times I looked, I couldn’t place him—he was literally off the chart. As far as the C.D.C. was concerned, my son, at his age, height, and weight, was unimaginable. When he was four, I took him to see a pediatrician in Boston. She entered his measurements into her computer, and a red dot appeared on the chart. I felt my body finally relax; my child was no longer impossible! He was on the chart. Then I realized that the pediatrician was working with an interactive chart. (This was in the early aughts, and there weren’t any available to me at home.) She had just put him in the system. His little red dot was still below the lowest, fifth-percentile curve. He was still the smallest child of his age. But a sort of cognitive trick had been performed. My son’s size had been documented, and this made him possible.\n\n[Donald Trump](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/donald-trump) has [played this trick](https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/under-trump-the-language-we-use-to-create-political-reality-is-crumbling) on Americans many times, beginning with his very election: first, he was impossible, and then he was President. Did that mean that the impossible had happened—an extremely hard concept to absorb—or did it mean that Trump was not the catastrophe so many of us had assumed he would be? A great many Americans chose to think that he had been secretly Presidential all along or was about to become Presidential; they chose to accept that, now that he was elected, his Presidency would become conceivable. The choice between these two positions is at the root of the argument between Ocasio-Cortez and the critics of her concentration-camp comment. It is not an argument about language. Ocasio-Cortez and her opponents agree that the term “concentration camp” refers to something so horrible as to be unimaginable. (For this reason, mounting a defense of Ocasio-Cortez’s position by explaining that not all concentration camps were death camps misses the point.) It is the choice between thinking that whatever is happening in reality is, by definition, acceptable, and thinking that some actual events in our current reality are fundamentally incompatible with our concept of ourselves—not just as Americans but as human beings—and therefore unimaginable. The latter position is immeasurably more difficult to hold—not so much because it is contentious and politically risky, as attacks on Ocasio-Cortez continue to demonstrate, but because it is cognitively strenuous. It makes one’s brain implode. It will always be a minority position.","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c7a2710c62d1081540c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"alexandria-ocasio-cortez"},{"id":"5c2e1c8481ab3335f580f17d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Concentration Camps","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"concentration-camps"},{"id":"5c2e20402710c62d10815700","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Liz Cheney","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"liz-cheney"},{"id":"5c2e1c762bfcc72cd92d051d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Donald Trump","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"donald-trump"},{"id":"5c2e1f23425c632c6cd70791","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Immigrants, Immigration","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"immigrants-immigration"},{"id":"5c2e1dd87e716b454591af01","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Family Separations","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"family-separations"}],"sections":[{"id":"59ef6620c6604764e97c762c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Our Columnists","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"our-columnists"}]},"channel":"News","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"5910a6e62e2e17730741c6b7","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Masha Gessen began contributing to *The New Yorker* in 2014 and became a staff writer in 2017\\.

Video by Danny Gold.\n|||\n\n\n-=-=-=-\n\n\nWhen Manuel ran away from [El Salvador](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/el-salvador), in 2015, the country had one of the highest murder rates in the world: a hundred and four murders per hundred thousand inhabitants. So Manuel, who was still a teen-ager, made sure that he would make it to the U.S.’s southern border with a file of legal documents that, he thought, could save his life. “Evidence,” he said—“papers that affirmed that I was in danger.” He was fleeing a local gang that had threatened him, and he saw no choice but to find a way out of the country—he planned to request asylum once he reached the U.S., and hoped that he would be able to bring his family along later. At first, all seemed to be going according to plan. He made it to El Paso, Texas, where an immigration officer told him that he had a strong case. Soon after, he moved to Little Rock, Arkansas, and started working to send remittances back to his family, including his one-year-old daughter. “I worked from 7 *A.M.*{:.small} to 7 *P.M.*{:.small} in landscaping, then until 1 *A.M.*{:.small} in a gas station,” he said. He was relieved to walk around his new neighborhood without having to look over his shoulder. \n\nBut, at the end of 2017, an immigration judge denied him asylum. He was in shock. He insisted that he had done things by the book: presenting himself at a port of entry, providing documentation of his plight, never missing a hearing. Last April, he was deported back to El Salvador. In the video above, Manuel tells the story of his journey.\n\nThe [Trump Administration](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/trump-administration) has not made the immigration process easy for the hundreds of people seeking asylum. In 2017, immigration judges rejected sixty-one per cent of all asylum cases, the highest denial rate in a decade. During the first half of this year, the number of immigration courts finding “credible fear” in asylum seekers’ screenings plummeted from thirty per cent to fourteen per cent. Attorney General [Jeff Sessions](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/jeff-sessions) has talked about elevating “the threshold standard of proof in credible fear interviews” and has argued against granting asylum to [victims of domestic abuse or gang violence](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-trump-administration-is-completely-unraveling-the-us-asylum-system). \n\nBack in El Salvador, Manuel hasn’t returned to his old neighborhood. Terrified of the men who threatened him, he moved into his sister’s apartment and didn’t leave his room for weeks. He was in a state of “constant paranoia” every time he had to take a public bus. Eventually, like many deportees, he started taking English classes in order to find [a job at a call center](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/01/23/the-deportees-taking-our-calls). But he is still living in a state of uncertainty. “Are you worried about your future?” the video reporter Danny Gold asked Manuel recently. “Yes,” Manuel said. “To be honest, my future is what’s on my mind in these moments. I can’t get it out of my head. What am I going to do? Who am I going to be in the future?” ","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c7be56e652c90274665","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Asylum Seekers","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"asylum-seekers"},{"id":"5c2e1ca62bfcc72cd92d0562","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Central America","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"central-america"},{"id":"5c2e1d4a7e716b454591ae79","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"El Salvador","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"el-salvador"},{"id":"5c2e1c767e716b454591ad9c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Immigration","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"immigration"},{"id":"5c2e1cdae56e652c902746f0","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Ice","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"ice"},{"id":"5c2e1c7d41c92e2c9b85da22","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Trump Administration","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"trump-administration"},{"id":"5c2e1c7e41e4c73c088d7763","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Border Crisis","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"border-crisis"}],"sections":[{"id":"590a02541c7a8e33fb390be1","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"News Desk","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"news-desk"},{"id":"5cc0cc7ca08d1428b0f73500","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Screening Room","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"screening-room"}]},"channel":"News","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"5910a878dd6207318b5db96a","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"","canonicalUrl":"http://www.newyorker.com/contributors/camila-osorio","email":"","name":"Camila Osorio","socialMedia":[],"title":"Camila Osorio is a member of The New Yorker’s editorial staff.

She heard a prerecorded announcement in Farsi: “Dear caller, this is a phone call from an inmate in Evin Prison.” The message repeated itself every two minutes, interrupting her husband, a graduate student at Princeton University who had gone to Iran to research his doctoral dissertation, as he struggled to explain that he had been arrested and was being charged with espionage. During the next three years, Qu has spoken with her husband each week by phone. In the first year, they talked once a week for ten minutes; in the past two years, they’ve spoken several times a week. Qu, who does not speak Farsi, has come to memorize the announcement’s rhythms. \n\nIn the days since Iran shot down an American drone and President Trump nearly carried out retaliatory air strikes, Qu has been terrified that armed conflict between the countries could be devastating to her husband’s case and his already deteriorating health. For months, Wang has been beset by skin rashes, migraines, back pain from sleeping on the ground, and arthritis in his knee. Increasingly depressed, he worries incessantly about his wife and their young son, Shaofan. “He reacts very strongly to every piece of news he reads in the Iranian newspapers about what is going on,” Qu said. “The major reason for his anxiety is worrying about me and Shaofan, since we have been managing without him for a long time, especially when Shaofan experiences difficulties in school.”      \n\nIn March, Shaofan, the couple’s only child, turned six. After living almost half his life without his father, Shaofan is often reluctant to speak to him when he calls. When Wang tries to reminisce with his son about their time together, Shaofan tells his father that he can’t remember it anymore. When his mother speaks with his father, the boy often interrupts them, demanding his mother’s attention.\n\nRecently, Wang, a Ph.D. candidate in history, began trying to make new memories with his son. Late at night in Tehran, when the prison was quiet enough for writing, Wang began drafting a letter to Shaofan. He tried to explain the notion of history, and what it was that took his father, a historian, to Iran in the first place.\n\n“Shaofan, my dear boy,” he begins. “Don’t you find the word history is similar to the word story?&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. History and story are very similar, in fact history and story were written the same as late as 600 years ago. But the main difference between history and story is that history should be supported by evidence but a story does not have to be. For example, when we say, ‘Shaofan was born and spent his first year and a half in Beijing,’ we have Shaofan’s birth certificate and many photos to support this claim. But Shaofan’s favorite monkey king and superhero stories are imagined. They need not be supported by evidence and therefore, they are stories.” In the letter, Wang asks his wife to show their son maps and pictures of ancient Greece or Japan, or to write for him the Chinese word that denotes history. Soon, Wang plans to write tales from Chinese history for Shaofan, particularly in the boy’s favorite genre: adventure stories.\n\nWang is one of [at least five Americans](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/10/world/middleeast/iran-nizar-zakka-release.html) currently detained or missing in Iran. His doctoral work focusses on nineteenth-century governance in Central Asia, and he travelled to Iran on a student visa in early 2016 without incident. Several months later, when he planned to return to Iran, there seemed to be no cause for concern. “He was not a high-risk person,” Stephen Kotkin, his academic adviser at Princeton, told me. In May of 2016, he went back to Iran to conduct research in the country’s archives and to study Farsi.\n\nAt Princeton, Wang had spent long days at the library working and then would rush home to cook lavish meals for Qu and their young son. Wang’s dissertation research was slated to take him first to Iran and, later, to Russia. After arriving in Iran, he worked feverishly, in the hopes of culling all he could before returning to Princeton. Wang’s life in Tehran was regimented: he rose early each day and, while he heated his porridge, he called his wife, who was usually on her way to bed. By seven o’clock, he was in a taxi, heading to the archives. When he returned to his apartment in the afternoon, he and Qu would call each other, and stay on video chat while they went about their days. “We used to do that when he travelled anywhere, as if we were physically together,” Qu told me during a recent conversation in a student cafe at Princeton.\n\nBy late July, Wang’s research at the diplomatic archives was nearly complete and he was eager to get home, but he had received no reply to his request to access the national archives. The documents he was asking for were neither classified nor related to contemporary politics. Most were newspaper clippings published between 1880 and 1921, material that was originally in the public domain. So, with his language tutor, a former employee at the archives, Wang stopped by the office of the deputy head of the archives. When they arrived, the deputy head greeted them warmly and brought them into the reading room, saying that they could search for documents there. He even suggested that the archives might sponsor his visa in future. Wang’s language tutor agreed to copy the outstanding documents, so that Wang could return home. Kotkin, his adviser, approved the plan. “This is very common throughout the region,” Kotkin told me. “We all engage in versions of that because we cannot be there for the time necessary.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. We need to have some copies and scans. It’s a shortcut that is widespread.” But, on his second attempt to retrieve documents, Wang’s language tutor was stopped and questioned by the police. \n\nThe following day, Wang was ordered to report to a police station in Tehran, where officers confiscated his laptop and passport. When he called his academic adviser, in Princeton, and the Swiss Embassy, which represents U.S. interests in Iran, they told him to remain calm and assured him that these were tactics commonly used to intimidate foreign academics. On August 7th, Wang phoned Qu, telling her that he’d been called to a meeting with police at a hotel; he asked her to notify Princeton and the Swiss Embassy if she did not hear from him. Three hours later, he called again, sounding happy. He was packing. He told Qu that he had been asked to leave the country immediately and that there was a man waiting downstairs to escort him to the airport. Wang said that he planned to call the Swiss Embassy and ask them to have someone meet him at the airport with a plane ticket. He was coming home. That was the last time Qu would hear from Wang for nearly three weeks.\n\nWang speaks or reads more than ten languages—Chinese, English, Russian, Ottoman Turkish, Uzbek, Farsi, Hindi, and Urdu, Manchu, among others. His language abilities and passion for his work reminded other Princeton graduate students of scholars from another time. “It’s almost like of another era, when this was the Silk Road and everybody had to be so multilingual,” Sarah Carson, a close friend of Wang’s and fellow-Ph.D. candidate at Princeton, told me. Wang studied what life looked like in empires’ most remote corners, where languages and cultures brushed up against one another and the power of the central government was most attenuated. “There are very few areas of the map where we have basically no history or very poor history, and he was going to open up something entirely new and do so in a way that almost no one else in the world was capable of doing,” Joshua Bauchner, another of Wang’s friends and colleagues at Princeton, told me. “It’s heroic.” \n\nThe son of a stage designer for the Chinese Air Force performance troupe and a tailor, Wang grew up in a crowded apartment in Beijing in the nineteen-nineties. He traces his curiosity about far-away places to his grandfather, an editor of the French-language edition of a Chinese-government-owned magazine who spoke several languages, including Esperanto, despite never leaving China. When Wang was a little boy, his grandfather would present him with a stack of old letters, all written in green ink, the color of Esperanto, and Wang would eagerly cut out the stamps for his collection. To keep his grandson company, Wang’s grandfather would tell him about the authors of the letters—fellow-Esperanto speakers from the United States and Eastern Europe and their writings, portals to a world he would never see. \n\nIn middle school, Wang bought a Hindi textbook, because he thought the script was beautiful. After trying to study the language by himself, Wang came to an impasse: he had never heard any of its letters spoken aloud. One of his grandfather’s colleagues at the state foreign-language press translated Hindi books into Chinese. Wang met with the translator who, for the first time, pronounced the letters he found so beautiful on the page. At the age of nineteen, Wang ventured abroad for the first time, visiting India as an exchange student. After his mother married an American citizen, [he moved to the United States](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/10/magazine/american-civilian-hostages-in-iran.html). He received a bachelor’s degree in South Asian studies from the University of Washington and a master’s degree in [Russian and Eurasian studies](https://www.theatlantic.com/news/archive/2017/07/iran-xiyue-wang/533868/) from Harvard. \n\nWang met Qu in Hong Kong, in 2009, where they were working for the same law firm. Wang was about to start a job with the International Red Cross in Afghanistan, as a Pashto translator. One of his roles was to meet with illiterate inmates in rural Afghan prisons and write letters for them to their families. Like his grandfather, Wang had an extraordinary gift for speaking foreign languages. In 2012, he and Qu married, and he applied to Princeton. The following year, their son was born.\n\nAt first, after Wang was arrested, Qu used to stare at the Evin Prison complex on Google Earth, zooming in as close as she could on the courtyard where her husband spent an hour each day, trying to imagine his life there. For a year, at Princeton’s suggestion, Qu kept her husband’s imprisonment to herself, hoping that he would quietly be released. In the end, it was Iran that made his arrest public, announcing on state television, in July, 2017, that he had been sentenced to ten years in prison on espionage charges, following a closed trial.\n\nWhen she is not working at her full-time job as a lawyer or caring for their son, Qu puzzles over how to bring her husband home. She has worked with Princeton officials, talked with experts on Iran, and lobbied members of Congress and the Trump Administration. She has been assured by Administration officials that they are working for her husband’s release, but she has been left largely in the dark about what is happening. “Every day is different,” Qu said. “And, given this bigger picture into which we have no insights, it is very difficult to know if the U.S. government is prioritizing the hostage issue.” The most recent tensions between the U.S. and Iran unfolded as Qu was visiting relatives in Beijing. Wang’s father asked her if the U.S. was doing everything it could to secure his son’s release. “I couldn’t give him that confidence,” Qu said. “I can’t say that they’re not, but I can’t say it’s positive either.”\n\nIn February, prison administrators summoned Wang to their offices. For a moment, he let himself hope he was being released. Wang had heard that such things happened quietly, with no fanfare, warning, or goodbyes. When he arrived at the office, Wang saw his suitcase—the one that had been confiscated two and a half years ago. He took a breath and asked a guard if he was being freed. The guard smiled and asked Wang how many more years he had left on his prison sentence. The prison authorities were simply returning his suitcase and other belongings to him. \n\nInside the suitcase, he saw a stack of books on the history of Iran and Farsi-language textbooks he no longer needed after more than two years of language immersion in prison. There were clothes that seemed to belong to someone else in another life, and a photo album Qu had made for him before he’d left Princeton, filled with pictures of their family. Before leaving the room, he took only one item: a photograph of his wife and son.  \n\nIn the early hours of the morning, Qu paints pictures of herself, Wang, and Shaofan. Some pictures are copied from photographs, others from memories. Still other pictures are imagined scenes of the three of them: in canoes, on bicycles, sitting on a tree branch looking at the moon. One that she showed me was more opaque, depicting a deer, a monkey, and a gourd. When I asked her about it, Qu laughed and explained that the monkey is Wang, who was born in the year of the monkey; the gourd is Shaofan, whom they call “little gourd,” an auspicious name in Chinese; and Qu is the deer, a name Wang calls her, after the female deer that populate the Indian folktales he loves to recount. In the painting, the deer is carrying both the monkey and the gourd.","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c8841e4c73c088d777c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e1c8841e4c73c088d777c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Iran","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"iran"},{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"name":"Iran","parent":[{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"},"slug":"iran"},{"id":"5c2e1c76ee7fe02cbd163323","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e1c76ee7fe02cbd163323","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Prisons","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"prisons"},{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"name":"Prisons","parent":[{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"}],"photos":{},"root":{"id":"5afc81b4577f6a3b0500895c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Tags","parent":null,"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"tags"},"slug":"prisons"},{"id":"5c2e1c762bfcc72cd92d051d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e1c762bfcc72cd92d051d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Donald

Iran’s Revolutionary Guard fired a missile at a U.S. drone flying near the Strait of Hormuz, the strategic gateway for world oil supplies. The unmanned spy plane, which cost more than a hundred million dollars, and had a wingspan of a hundred and thirty feet, exploded in a fireball. Tehran tweeted the drone’s purported coördinates in its airspace. The Trump Administration countered that the attack occurred over international waters and was “unprovoked.” Several hours later, [President Trump](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/donald-trump) ordered a retaliatory strike on three targets, then cancelled it at the last minute, because, he said in a tweet on Friday, the potential death toll was “not proportionate to shooting down an unmanned drone.” But tensions between the two countries remain higher than at any point in three decades.\n\nThe missile strike intersects with two other flash points. The Administration blames Tehran for attacks on international shipping—six foreign oil tankers in the Gulf of Oman since May 12th—and for aggressive acts by proxies in Iraq, Saudi Arabia, and Afghanistan. Iran is also threatening to breach the landmark 2015 [nuclear deal](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/trump-destroys-the-iran-dealand-a-lot-more) in July, unless major powers, notably in Europe, provide the economic benefits that it promised. Trump unilaterally—and recklessly—abandoned the deal a year ago, then reimposed punitive sanctions. Iran’s oil exports have plummeted—from 3.2 million barrels a day to some half a million. Now, in response, Tehran says that it will exceed the limits that the deal placed on its nuclear program, starting with the enrichment of a higher grade of uranium. The threat may be brinkmanship, but, in theory, that uranium could also be used to fuel a bomb within a year.\n\n“The United States does not seek conflict with Iran,” Patrick Shanahan, the Acting Secretary of Defense, said on June 17th, just hours before he resigned. Yet, since May, the Pentagon has committed thousands of new troops to the region, along with B-52 bombers, Patriot air-defense missiles, and a carrier strike group led by the U.S.S. Abraham Lincoln. Trump now has four options to rectify a crisis of his own making. One is to steadily increase his “maximum pressure” campaign to cut off Tehran’s oil exports, while pushing to negotiate a broader accord that would address terrorism, ballistic missiles, regional meddling, and human rights. The prospects of success are small. “There’s zero incentive for Iran to talk to us,” John Kirby, a retired admiral and a former spokesman at the State Department and at the Pentagon, said. “We’ve damaged Iran’s economy, but not enough to bring it to the table.” Nor does the Islamic Republic want to reward Trump for scrapping the nuclear accord.\n\nAnother proposal is to flaunt even more troops, ships, and aircraft around Iran’s borders—or even to deploy the U.S. Navy to escort tankers through the Persian Gulf. It’s been tried before: [in 1987](https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/a-tanker-war-in-the-middle-eastagain), during the Iran-Iraq War, Operation Earnest Will, the largest U.S. convoy since the Second World War, had thirty ships in the Gulf to escort reflagged Kuwaiti tankers ferrying Iraqi oil. The first tanker struck an Iranian mine. Iran blamed “invisible hands,” but heralded the incident as “an irreparable blow to America’s political and military prestige.’’ In 1988, the U.S.S. Samuel B. Roberts hit a mine and almost sank; in retaliation, the U.S. destroyed two Iranian oil platforms and four ships. The United States was not an innocent party: the U.S.S. Vincennes mistakenly downed an Iran Air passenger plane, killing two hundred and ninety people. Earnest Will lasted for fourteen months, ending only after Iran and Iraq agreed to a ceasefire.\n\nA third option is a tit-for-tat military response to any provocation. That is what the White House was considering on Thursday night—the equivalent of its “precision strikes” [on Syrian sites in 2018](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-syria-strikes-and-what-bashar-al-assad-wants). The targets were reportedly Iranian missile batteries and radar sites. But Iran is not Syria, the shell of a former state; it has the world’s eighth-largest military, with more than half a million forces. Punitive action would send a strong signal, but it could also trigger a potentially catastrophic escalatory cycle.\n\nThe worst option is the one that both countries say they don’t want: a full-on war. Trump’s initial response to the drone attack was that it was likely unintentional—a “bad mistake.” In a televised address, Major General Hossein Salami, the commander of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard, said, “We do not have any intention for war with any country, but we are fully ready.” A U.S. military campaign would probably not replicate the interventions in Iraq or Afghanistan. “We’re not doing regime-change operations,” Ilan Goldenberg, a former Pentagon and State Department specialist who is now at the Center for a New American Security, said. Nevertheless, “the instructions would be to take out as much as possible—the Quds Force, the nuclear program, maritime forces, and conventional capabilities.” To preëmpt conflict, six U.S. senators have introduced a bipartisan proposal to block funds for military operations against the Islamic Republic. “Congress has not authorized war with Iran, and we need to make sure that saber rattling and miscalculation don’t spark a catastrophic conflict,” Tom Udall, Democrat of New Mexico, said.\n\nWhatever course the Administration pursues, it will need partners. Belgium, Britain, France, Holland, and Italy all joined Operation Earnest Will. But mobilizing allies—for international sanctions, maritime operations, or military support—won’t be easy for Trump. “I’m not sure why anyone would sign up to operate with us, in harm’s way, because of the way we’ve treated them,” Douglas Lute, a former U.S. Ambassador to *NATO*{: .small}, said. “This Administration has proven itself unreliable.”\n\nIn the past month, Japan, France, Germany, Switzerland, Iraq, and Oman have quietly conveyed messages between Washington and Tehran in an effort to defuse tensions. Neither side seems ready to accept the other’s terms to talk; there’s no dénouement in sight. The current crisis might have been avoided if Trump had stuck to the nuclear deal and built on it, tapping the heft of Europe, Russia, and China, which together with the United States had elicited the Iranian concessions. Instead, the Administration is scrambling alone militarily in the waters through which thirty per cent of the world’s seaborne energy flows. The irony is that the United States no longer needs much oil from the Gulf. The hypocrisy is that Trump vowed to bring American forces home from the Middle East, after eighteen years of multiple wars. The tragedy is that another one may be on the horizon. ♦","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c762bfcc72cd92d051d","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Donald Trump","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"donald-trump"},{"id":"5c2e1c8841e4c73c088d777c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Iran","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"iran"},{"id":"5c2e1c9bb75f002c8941e4a8","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Wars","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"wars"},{"id":"5c2e1d35b75f002c8941e530","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Drones","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"drones"},{"id":"5c2e1c7d81ab3335f580f174","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Foreign Policy","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"foreign-policy"}],"sections":[{"id":"592dfa44d5fda942c34a0b61","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Comment","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"comment"}]},"channel":"Magazine","contentSource":"magazine","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"5910a8a54e65be2f29d55eb2","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Robin Wright has been a contributing writer to *The New Yorker* since\n1988.

(The authorization never came; neither did the strike.) [Donald Trump](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/donald-trump)’s Rose Garden is Twitter. So, on Friday morning, the world was anxiously monitoring the @realDonaldTrump feed to see what he had to say about the decision he made on Thursday evening, to call off a missile strike on Iran. According to a blockbuster [report](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/20/world/middleeast/iran-us-drone.html) in the *Times*, Trump authorized the strike in response to Iran’s downing of an unmanned American spy plane, only to change his mind, even as U.S. warplanes tasked with carrying out the mission were already in the air. (In an interview with Chuck Todd, Trump said that he had not yet approved the strike when it was cancelled, and that the planes had not taken off.) Sure enough, shortly after 9 *A.M.*{: .small}, Eastern Time, Trump posted four long tweets in which he sought to explain what happened. First, he recounted his decision to end the nuclear agreement that Iran reached with the United States and five other countries in 2015\\. As he has in the past, he called the agreement a “terrible deal” and falsely claimed that it gave Iran “a free path” to nuclear weapons. Then he moved on to the Iranian downing of the RQ-4A Global Hawk spy plane, which took place on Wednesday evening, Washington time, and claimed that the drone had been flying in international waters. (Iran claims that it was in Iranian airspace.)\n\n“We were cocked & loaded to retaliate last night on 3 different sights when I asked, how many will die,” Trump wrote. “150 people, sir, was the answer from a General. 10 minutes before the strike I stopped it, not&nbsp;.&thinsp;.&thinsp;.&nbsp;proportionate to shooting down an unmanned drone. I am in no hurry, our Military is rebuilt, new, and ready to go, by far the best in the world. Sanctions are biting & more added last night. Iran can NEVER have Nuclear Weapons, not against the USA, and not against the WORLD!”\n\nAs with virtually everything that Trump does, the immediate responses to his turnabout were mixed. In this instance, though, the criticism largely came from the Republican side, and some of the praise came from the unlikeliest of quarters, including John Brennan, the former C.I.A. director who has repeatedly blasted the President as a corrupt authoritarian. “I do applaud Trump’s decision not to carry out what would have been a disproportionate strike&nbsp;.&thinsp;.&thinsp;.&nbsp;that could have led to a dangerous escalatory spiral,” Brennan [told](https://www.msnbc.com/andrea-mitchell-reports/watch/frequent-trump-critic-john-brennan-applauds-president-s-decision-on-iran-62413381860) MSNBC’s Andrea Mitchell. “I give him credit for being almost the adult up in the room, because of the war hawks like [John Bolton](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/05/06/john-bolton-on-the-warpath) and Mike Pompeo who are pushing towards this confrontation, which is not in anyone’s interest, especially the United States.” \n\nAccording to the *Times*, Bolton, Pompeo, and Gina Haspel, the current head of the C.I.A., all favored a military response, whereas top Pentagon officials took Brennan’s line, cautioning that “such an action could result in a spiralling escalation with risks for American forces in the region.” (In an interview with Reuters, an anonymous Administration official disputed such a split, saying, “There was complete unanimity amongst the president’s advisers and DOD leadership on an appropriate response to Iran’s activities.”)  In any event, earlier this week, the Pentagon [dispatched](https://www.npr.org/2019/06/18/733550350/pentagon-sending-1-000-more-u-s-troops-to-middle-east) another thousand troops to the Middle East, with the specific goal of securing U.S. bases and installations against possible attacks from Iranian forces and their proxy groups.\n\nNonetheless, on Friday, a number of Republicans criticized Trump’s decision not to go ahead with the strike, and some of them compared it to Obama’s reversal in 2013\\. The Republican representative Adam Kinzinger, who is a pilot in the National Guard, wrote on Twitter, “America is facing a crisis in confidence. Obama’s decision to cancel a strike in Syria in 2013 has had ramifications that are still being felt today. We cannot let the provocations and attacks by Iran go unanswered.” In a television interview, Kinzinger followed up this tweet by saying that the cancellation of the strike “sends a message that you don’t really know what the red line is&nbsp;.&thinsp;.&thinsp;.&nbsp;the red line may not be so red.”\n\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, a faithful Trump stooge, sought to defend his decision, saying, “He has a long-term game plan here.” But, of course, such a game plan is exactly what Trump lacks. For more than two years now, his Administration has been building up the pressure on Iran by withdrawing from the nuclear deal, employing aggressive rhetoric, and imposing ever-tighter economic sanctions. To many observers in the Middle East and elsewhere, it appears that the Administration’s real goal is a regime change in Tehran, even though Trump has recently denied that. But what is undeniable is that Trump’s policy has been inexorably leading us to a moment like this one.\n\n“Now what we see is we are trapped between the belligerent rhetoric of Trump towards Iran&nbsp;.&thinsp;.&thinsp;.&nbsp;and the Donald Trump who said he didn’t want to get us into another war in the Middle East,” Ben Rhodes, a former Obama Administration official, said on MSNBC. “They are at a point of complete strategic incoherence. They are saying they don’t want a war but everything they are doing is making a war more likely.” On Thursday night, Trump stepped back from the brink. But the policy that got him into this mess is still firmly in place.

On Thursday afternoon, Moore announced his intention to run again, saying, during a press conference in Montgomery, with a yellow notepad in hand, “I fought for our country in Vietnam. I fought for our country and its laws as Chief Justice. I fought for morality, to serve our moral institutions. And I’m ready to do it again. Yes, I will run for the United States Senate in 2020.” He added, “Can I win? Yes, I can win. Not only can I—they know I can. That’s why there’s such opposition to me.” Moore also referred to the “false tactics” used by “Democratic operatives” to disrupt his last campaign. He was alluding to a report, [published by the *Times*](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/19/us/alabama-senate-roy-jones-russia.html) last December, that “a group of Democratic tech experts” had carried out an experimental cyber misinformation effort. The *Times* concluded that the project was unlikely to have affected the election’s outcome. In his announcement, Moore called the 2017 Alabama Senate election “fraudulent,” and predicted that Senate Republicans would run “a smear campaign” against him. \n\n \n\nMichael Bullington recently became chair of the Greater Birmingham Young Republicans. The group vocally [opposed Moore’s previous candidacy](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/unlike-their-elders-alabamas-young-republicans-wrestle-with-the-roy-moore-allegations) for the Senate seat, which became available, last time around, when [Jeff Sessions](https://www.newyorker.com/tag/jeff-sessions) was appointed to be U.S. Attorney General. Like many other Republicans unsettled by allegations against Moore of sexual misconduct, Bullington [wrote in the name of another candidate](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/28/us/alabama-write-ins-luther-strange-roy-moore.html)—though Bullington told me, on Thursday, that he couldn’t quite remember which one he’d settled on. “Probably Del Marsh,” he said, referring to the Republican president pro tempore of the Alabama Senate. “I honestly didn’t expect to be reliving this drama eighteen months later,” Bullington added, noting that he would have kept tabs on Moore’s potential candidacy via Moore’s Twitter page, but Moore blocked Bullington during the last campaign.\n\n \n\nBullington said that he’d be happy to vote for any of the other notable Republicans who have entered the race so far, or are expected to do so—including Tommy Tuberville, the former Auburn University football coach; the congressman Bradley Byrne, the state representative Arnold Mooney; and the Alabama secretary of state, John Merrill. He would also vote for Sessions, were he to run for his old seat—not Moore, though, even against a Democrat. “He was credibly accused of sexual assault by several women,” Bullington said. “He’s currently engaged in multiple lawsuits and seems to be losing. His name identification has largely a negative connotation. He has trouble fixing his taxes right,” Bullington added, referring to [the reported failure](https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/charitys-promised-back-pay-to-roy-moore-was-not-reported-to-irs-as-income/2017/10/19/fa31ab9c-b042-11e7-99c6-46bdf7f6f8ba_story.html?utm_term=.c4689639184e) of Moore’s former charity, the Foundation for Moral Law, to disclose half a million dollars of compensation to him. “[His lawyer was arrested](https://www.al.com/news/huntsville/2019/06/roy-moores-lawyer-trenton-garmon-arrested-on-drug-charges.html) on drug charges,” Bullington went on. (The lawyer in question, Trenton Garmon, has [denied any wrongdoing](https://www.al.com/news/anniston-gadsden/2019/06/trenton-garmon-denies-wrongdoing-in-arrest-says-he-uses-medical-marijuana.html).) “He has lost three statewide campaigns. And he was removed from the bench multiple times.”\n\n \n\nA Republican pollster [told the Washington *Post*](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/06/20/roy-moore-might-launch-another-senate-run-theres-nothing-washington-republicans-can-do-about-it/?utm_term=.9117c2a80c14) this week that, despite all of this, Moore could win twenty per cent or more of the vote in a Republican primary, positioning him to earn the Party’s nomination for the Senate a second time. “If the Alabama G.O.P. puts him on the ballot,” Bullington said, “then we deserve to lose.”\n\n \n\nCam Ward, a member of the Alabama State Senate, was more forgiving. “He marches to the beat of his own drummer,” Ward said of Moore on Thursday morning. “He has a sizeable base that will support him regardless of the election. Now, the circumstances of this election, as opposed to the one two years ago, have changed dramatically,” Ward continued. “Luther Strange”—the Trump-backed incumbent whom Moore beat in the 2017 primary—“was viewed as the country-club establishment at that time. This time, the field is full of non-incumbents, outsiders,” like Moore. “I don’t think this new dynamic will favor him. It’s harder for him to draw a contrast with this broader, robust, more outsider-filled field.”\n\n \n\n“I want to beat Doug Jones,” Ward went on. “I don’t want a rematch of two years ago. Any Republican nominee is always gonna have a chance in Alabama, but I agree with President Trump on this one. I don’t think Judge Moore is in the best position to win.”\n\n \n\nTrump weighed in on the race well before Moore’s announcement: in late May, he preëmptively opposed Moore’s potential candidacy—after strongly supporting Moore in the 2017 race. “Republicans cannot allow themselves to again lose the Senate seat in the Great State of Alabama,” [Trump tweeted](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1133699631857262593) late last month. “This time it will be for Six Years, not just Two. I have NOTHING against Roy Moore, and unlike many other Republican leaders, wanted him to win. But he didn’t, and probably won’t.”\n\n \n\nElizabeth BeShears, a political-communications consultant and Republican based in Birmingham, said, before Moore’s announcement, “Roy Moore’s ego knows no bounds.” His nomination, in 2017, was a “perfect storm,” she said, which she didn’t expect to see repeated. After Moore entered the race on Thursday, BeShears added, “Even if he’s completely innocent of the accusations that came to light in 2017, this move is indicative of a person whose judgment Alabamians should never trust, who is willing to turn yet another election cycle into a self-centered circus.” Though she has not yet made a decision, BeShears likes a handful of the Republicans who’ve already entered the race and is inclined to support most of them in a general election. “I hope Moore is relegated to the sidelines,” she added.\n\n \n\nMany people expect the secretary of state, Merrill, to announce his own candidacy soon, and he is believed to be a strong contender for the nomination. Merrill told me, “Obviously, if Judge Moore wants to pursue another campaign, he’s qualified to do so: he meets the standard for age and citizenship. But,” Merrill went on, “there are a number of people who have already made up their minds about his candidacy, because of what we went through in 2017\\. He’d have a difficult time overcoming some of those things that were presented and would be raised again.” Merrill added, “The people of Alabama decided they’d rather have Senator Jones than Judge Moore, and it’s very important that we elect a proven, conservative reformer who is recognized as a winner.”","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c7e22d4972cd5b8329b","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[{"id":"5c2e1c7e22d4972cd5b8329b","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"2020

centuries, renewal movements have emerged within Christianity and\ntaken on different forms and names. Often, they have invoked the word\n“evangelical.” Followers of Martin Luther, who emphasized the doctrine\nof salvation by faith alone, described themselves in this way. The\nCambridge clergyman Charles Simeon, who led the Low Church renewal\nmovement within the Church of England, adopted the label. The\ntrans-Atlantic eighteenth-century awakenings and revivals led by the\nWesleys were also often called “evangelical.” In the nineteen-forties\nand fifties, Billy Graham and others promoted the word to describe\nthemselves and the religious space they were seeking to create between\nthe cultural withdrawal espoused by the fundamentalist movement, on the\none hand, and mainline Protestantism’s departures from historic\nChristian doctrine, on the other. In each of these phases, the term has\nhad a somewhat different meaning, and yet it keeps surfacing because it\nhas described a set of basic historic beliefs and impulses.\n\nWhen I became a Christian in college, in the early nineteen-seventies,\nthe word “evangelical” still meant an alternative to the fortress\nmentality of fundamentalism. Shortly thereafter, I went to\nGordon-Conwell Theological Seminary, to prepare for the Presbyterian\nministry. It was one of the many institutions that Graham, Harold\nOckenga, and J. Howard Pew, and other neo-evangelicals, as they were\nsometimes called, established. In those years, there was such great\nenergy in the movement that, by the mid-nineteen-nineties, it had\neclipsed mainline Protestantism as the dominant branch of the Christian\nchurch in the U.S. When I moved to Manhattan to start a new church, in\n1989, most people I met found the church and its ministry to be a\ncuriosity in secular New York but not a threat. And, if they heard the\nword “evangelical” around the congregation, a name we seldom used, they\nusually asked what it meant.\n\nToday, while the name is no longer unfamiliar in my city, its meaning\nhas changed drastically. The conservative leaders who have come to be\nmost identified with the movement have largely driven this redefinition.\nBut political pollsters have also helped, as they have sought to\nhighlight a crucial voting bloc. When they survey people, there is no\ndiscussion of any theological beliefs, or other criteria. The great\nmajority of them simply ask people, “Would you describe yourself as a\nborn-again or evangelical Christian?” And those who answer ‘yes’ are\ncounted. More than eighty per cent of such people voted for Donald\nTrump, and, last week, a similar percentage cast their ballots for Roy\nMoore, in [the Alabama Senate race](https://www.newyorker.com/current/alabama-senate-race-roy-moore-doug-jones). So, in common parlance, evangelicals\nhave become people with two qualities: they are both self-professed\nChristians and doggedly conservative politically.\n\nThe fury and incredulity of many in the larger population at this\nconstituency has mounted. People who once called themselves the “Moral\nMajority” are now seemingly willing to vote for anyone, however immoral,\nwho supports their political positions. The disgust has come to include\npeople within the movement itself. Earlier this month, Peter Wehner, an\nOp-Ed writer for the *Times* who served in the last three Republican\nAdministrations, wrote a [widely circulated piece](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/09/opinion/sunday/wehner-evangelical-republicans.html?rref=collection%2Fcolumn%2Fpeter-wehner&action=click&contentCollection=opinion&region=stream&module=stream_unit&version=latest&contentPlacement=1&pgtype=collecti) entitled “Why I Can No Longer Call Myself an Evangelical Republican.” Many younger believers and Christians of color, who had previously\nidentified with evangelicalism, have also declared their abandonment of\nthe label. “Evangelical” used to denote people who claimed the high\nmoral ground; now, in popular usage, the word is nearly synonymous with “hypocrite.” When I used the word to describe myself in the\nnineteen-seventies, it meant I was not a fundamentalist. If I use the\nname today, however, it means to hearers that I *am.*\n\nUnderstanding the religious landscape, however, requires discerning\ndifferences between the smaller, let’s call it “big-E Evangelicalism,”\nwhich gets much media attention, and a much larger, little-e\nevangelicalism, which does not. The larger, lower-case evangelicalism is\ndefined not by a political party, whether conservative, liberal, or\npopulist, but by theological beliefs. This non-political definition of\nevangelicalism has been presented in many places. The most well known is\nby the historian David Bebbington, whose “Evangelicalism in Modern\nBritain: A History from the 1730s to the 1980s” has become standard. He\ndistinguishes evangelicals from other religions and Christians by a core\nset of beliefs. Evangelicals have generally believed in\nthe authority of the whole Bible, in contrast to mainline Protestants,\nwho regard many parts as obsolete, according to Bebbington. They also see it as the ultimate\nauthority, unlike Catholics, who make church tradition equal to it. In\naddition, the ancient creedal formulations of the church, such as the\nApostles’ Creed and the Nicene Creed, as well as others, are taken at\nface value, without reservation. And, again, unlike many in mainline Protestantism, evangelicals believe that Jesus\ntruly did exist as the divine Son before he was born, that he actually\nwas born of a virgin, and that he really was raised bodily from the\ndead.\n\nUnder Bebbington’s formulation, another defining evangelical quality is\nthe belief in the necessity of conversion, the conviction that everyone\nneeds a profound, life-changing encounter with God. This conversion,\nhowever, comes not merely through church attendance or general morality,\nbut only through faith in Christ’s sacrificial death for sin. A lyric\nfrom Charles Wesley’s famous hymn captures the evangelical experience of\nconversion through saving faith in Christ alone: “My chains fell off, my\nheart was free; I rose, went forth, and followed thee.” Finally,\ncontemporary evangelicals feel bound by both desire and duty to share\ntheir faith with others in both word and deeds of service. In this, they\nseek to resemble, as well as to obey, their Lord, Jesus, who is\ndescribed as mighty in word and deed.\n\nDo the self-identified white “big-E Evangelicals” of the pollsters hold\nto these beliefs? [Recent studies indicate](http://lifewayresearch.com/2017/12/06/many-evangelicals-dont-hold-evangelical-beliefs/) that many do not. In many parts of the country, Evangelicalism serves as the civil or folk religion accepted by default as part of one’s social\nand political identity. So, in many cases, it means that the political\nis more defining than theological beliefs, which has not been the case\nhistorically. And, because of the enormous amount of attention the media\npays to the Evangelical vote, the term now has a decisively political\nmeaning in popular usage.\n\nYet there exists a far larger evangelicalism, both here and around the\nworld, which is not politically aligned. In the U.S., there are millions\nof evangelicals spread throughout mainline Protestant congregations, as\nwell as in more theologically conservative denominations like the\nAssemblies of God, the Southern Baptist Convention, and the Lutheran\nChurch, Missouri Synod. But, most significantly, the vast majority of\nthe fast-growing Protestant churches in Asia, Latin America, and Africa\nall share these same beliefs. And in the U.S., while white\nEvangelicalism is aging and declining, evangelicalism over all is not.\n\nThe enormous energy of the churches in the global South and East has\nbegun to spill over into the cities of North America, where a new,\nmultiethnic evangelicalism is growing steadily. Non-Western missionaries\nhave started thousands of new urban churches there since the\nnineteen-seventies. Here in New York City, even within Manhattan, I have\nseen scores of churches begun over the last fifteen years that are fully\nevangelical by our definition, only a minority of which are white, and\nwhich are not aligned with any political party.\n\nIn my view, these churches tend to be much more committed to racial justice and care\nfor the poor than is commonly seen in white Evangelicalism. In this way,\nthey might be called liberal. On the other hand, these multicultural\nchurches remain avowedly conservative on issues like sex outside of\nmarriage. They look, to most eyes, like a strange mixture of liberal and\nconservative viewpoints, although they themselves see a strong inner\nconsistency between these views. They resist the contemporary ethical\npackage deals that today’s progressivism and conservatism seek to impose\non adherents, insisting that true believers must toe the line on every\none of a host of issues. But these younger evangelical churches simply\nwon’t play by those rules.\n\nIn a book published earlier this year, “In Search of Ancient Roots: The\nChristian Past and the Evangelical Identity Crisis,” the historian\nKenneth J. Stewart makes the case that the evangelical impulse in\nChristianity has been with us for centuries, taking on many different\nforms and bearing many different names, while maintaining substantially\nsimilar core beliefs. Many have analyzed the weaknesses of the current\niteration of this movement. The desire by mid-twentieth-century leaders\nto foster more widespread coöperation between evangelicals and downplay\ndenominational differences cut believers off from the past, some\nreligion scholars have found. The result was an emphasis on personal\nexperience rather than life in a church with historical memory. This has\nmade present-day evangelicals more vulnerable to political movements\nthat appeal to their self-interest, even in contradiction to Biblical\nteachings, for example, about welcoming the immigrant and lifting up the\npoor. However, evangelicalism is much more resilient than any one form\nof itself. The newer forms that are emerging are more concerned with\ntheological and historic roots, and are more resistant to modern\nindividualism than older, white Evangelicalism.\n\nDoes the word, then, have an ongoing usefulness? For now, the answer may\nbe no. These new urban churches are certainly not mainline Protestant,\nyet they don’t look at all like what the average person thinks of by the\nterm “Evangelical.” Will these younger churches abandon the name or try\nto redefine it? I don’t know, but, as a professional minister, I don’t\nthink it is the most important point to make. What is crucial to know is\nthat, even if the name “evangelical” is replaced with something else, it\ndoes not mean that the churches will lose their beliefs. Some time ago,\nthe word “liberal” was largely abandoned by Democrats in favor of the\nword “progressive.” In some ways, the Democratic Party is more liberal\nnow than when the older label was set aside, evidence that it is quite\npossible to change the name but keep the substance.\n\nThe same thing may be happening to evangelicalism. The movement may\nabandon, or at least demote, the prominence of the name, yet be more\ncommitted to its theology and historic impulses than ever. Some predict\nthat younger evangelicals will not only reject the name but also become\nmore secular.

And if evangelicals—or whatever they will\ncall themselves­—continue to become more multiethnic in leadership and confound the left-right political categories, they may continue to do so.","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1c794a08312cd3aa6c3a","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Christianity","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"christianity"},{"id":"5c2e1c7936cecf40192141cd","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Evangelicals","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"evangelicals"},{"id":"5c2e1c762710c62d10815407","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Politics","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"politics"}],"sections":[{"id":"590a02541c7a8e33fb390be1","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"News Desk","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"news-desk"},{"id":"5ae1c640b4e23f01a4a1192c","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"On Religion","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"on-religion"}]},"channel":"","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"5a3828503f8ec91405e4add2","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"","email":"","name":"Timothy Keller","socialMedia":[],"title":"Timothy Keller is the founder and Pastor Emeritus of the Redeemer Presbyterian Churches of New York City.

As ThinkProgress notes, the book, which consists of\nlectures by several men, “instructs students that women should not be\npermitted to run for elected office. If women do run for office, the\ncourse argues, people have a moral obligation not to vote for them.”\nAdditionally, the book criticizes the women’s-suffrage movement. Another\nof its authors is Doug Phillips, a proponent of so-called Biblical\npatriarchy who resigned from Vision Forum—a now-defunct evangelical\norganization, which helped produce the textbook—after [admitting to an affair](http://www.slate.com/blogs/xx_factor/2014/04/16/douglas_phillips_lawsuit_woman_alleges_sexual_mental_abuse_against_the_former.html) with a girl [who later filed a suit alleging](http://www.slate.com/blogs/xx_factor/2014/04/16/douglas_phillips_lawsuit_woman_alleges_sexual_mental_abuse_against_the_former.html) that Phillips began grooming her for sexual abuse when she was fifteen.\n\nOn Thursday, a spokesperson for Moore told *The Washingtonian* that\n“Judge Moore has never stated or believed that women are unqualified for\npublic office.” I spent much of yesterday speaking with Republican women\nin Alabama who either have worked or continue to work for conservative\ncauses and candidates. I asked them how Moore’s connection to the Vision\nForum textbook could affect the support he receives in the December 12th\nelection, which [recent polls give him an edge to win](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-is-roy-moore-back-in-front-time-and-trump-are-probably-helping/) over the Democrat, Doug Jones. (Jones had previously surged ahead in\nsome polling, partly on the strength of female support, but his momentum\nseems to have ebbed.) Most of the women answered on the record, despite\nthe negative repercussions that doing so could have on their party\nstanding. Elizabeth BeShears is a political-communications consultant\nbased in Birmingham. “In Alabama, we talk all the time about how,\nhistorically, the men run but the women are the ones who get them\nelected,” BeShears told me. “As a woman who has worked hard to get\nRepublicans elected to office, at all levels in the state, it’s\nextremely worrying to me to know that somebody who’s supposed to\nrepresent us at one of the highest levels in the country doesn’t think\nI’m good enough to serve in any capacity in political leadership.”\n\nBeShears went on, “For folks under forty in particular, Roy Moore has\nbeen a source of embarrassment—not a source of pride—for the majority of\nour lives. We don’t want to reward that by putting him in the Senate,\nwhere he’ll have an even larger stage—or pulpit, as he probably imagines\nit—to talk about his brand of Christianity. It’s time that the\nRepublican Party in Alabama knows that we’re not going to stand for\nbeing told that they have to vote for a person just because they have an\n‘R’ beside their name.” Who would BeShears vote for? “I am prayerfully\nconsidering voting for Doug Jones.”\n\nAnother powerful female figure in the state Party, who asked to remain\nunnamed, was more explicit. The textbook’s anti-woman argument was, for\nher, one of the most damning stories about Moore so far. “Does that mean our\ngovernor shouldn’t be governor?” she asked, referring to Kay Ivey. “Our\nSupreme Court Chief Justice shouldn’t be Supreme Court Chief Justice,\nand our Republican Party state chairwoman shouldn’t be chairwoman?”\n(Those positions are currently held by Lyn Stuart and Terry Lathan,\nrespectively.) “Because, I’ll tell you, I wasn’t gonna vote at all\nuntil this morning,” she continued. “I wasn’t gonna vote for Moore or\nJones. Now I’m voting for Doug Jones. Because if that guy”—Moore—“doesn’t think\nI need to be anywhere but the kitchen birthing babies, he can kiss my\nass.” She added, “I can’t say it publicly because it’ll ruin my career,\nand I don’t know how to do anything other than politics in Alabama. I\nwould be without income tomorrow. I can’t stand up and say anything. But\nif I’m not good enough to be in government, then I’m not good enough to\nvote for him, either.”\n\nCollier Tynes describes herself as a “Christian, pro-life conservative\nand lifelong Republican.” Until earlier this year, Tynes worked as the chief\nof staff to the former Alabama First Lady Dianne Bentley, who is now the\nex-wife of the disgraced governor Robert Bentley. Tynes played down the\nimpact of the textbook. “At this point, lifelong Republicans are not\nsurprised by Judge Moore’s association with a book that takes scripture\nout of context and preaches invalid beliefs,” Tynes told me. “It’s the\ncredible allegations of child molestation against Judge Moore that\nrightfully have pro-life Christians staying home on Election Day or\nsurrendering their votes to a Republican write-in candidate.” Tynes\ndeclined to publicly state for whom she would be voting, though, as she\nhas said elsewhere, it would not be Moore.\n\nThen there are those female supporters of Moore for whom the textbook\nrevelation is, to quote Alabama’s state auditor Jim Zeigler, [much ado about very little](https://www.mediaite.com/online/alabama-state-auditor-claims-allegations-against-roy-moore-much-ado-about-very-little/).\nDebbie Dooley, the co-founder of the Atlanta Tea Party and a Moore\nbacker, argued, in an e-mail, that just because Moore was one of the\ntextbook’s authors doesn’t mean that he shares all the views within it. “It is like being part of an event, but you don’t necessarily agree\nwith all the speakers,” she wrote. She went on, “I don’t believe for a minute that he believes that way. He has too many strong women around\nhim, including his wife Kayla. He also had Sarah Palin campaign for him\nand has praised her.” As ThinkProgress reported, Moore has never\npublicly endorsed a female candidate for office.\n\nBeShears told me that she fears that this latest revelation will have a\nmarginal effect on the vote. “People have made up their minds about\nvoting for him or not—barring something just absolutely crazy coming out\nin the next week and a half,” she said, adding, “It’s sad to me to have\nto say that, in the context of Moore’s reputation, this textbook thing\nisn’t fatal. It would sink a lot of other people. But he has such a\nloyal base that I don’t know what it would take to get them not to vote\nfor him.” Tynes was slightly more optimistic but, nonetheless, sounded\ndespairing about the situation. “Defending victims of childhood\nmolestation and the importance of women in government should not be\ncontroversial. Thus, the Alabama Republican Party’s continued support of\nRoy Moore has put lifelong Republican voters in a horrible position.”","canonicalUrl":"","categories":{"tags":[{"id":"5c2e1e1d41e4c73c088d7943","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Roy Moore","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"roy-moore"},{"id":"5c2e1cb32396212cbb9fc9e0","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Alabama","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"alabama"},{"id":"5c2e1c7b36cecf40192141d2","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"Republicans","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"republicans"}],"sections":[{"id":"590a02541c7a8e33fb390be1","modelName":"category","collection":"categories","contributors":{},"hierarchy":[],"name":"News Desk","parent":[null],"photos":{},"root":[],"slug":"news-desk"}]},"channel":"","contentSource":"web","contributors":{"author":[{"id":"5910a8b1dd6207318b5db98d","modelName":"contributor","collection":"contributors","bio":"Charles Bethea has been contributing to *The New Yorker* since 2008 and became a staff writer in 2018.
