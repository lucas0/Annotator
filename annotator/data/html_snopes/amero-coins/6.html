<b>SPECIAL NOTICE TO READERS, Monday, September 10, 2007:</b><br/>
			The web site "Snopes.com" has claimed today that the story below is FALSE.  <b>I stand-by the story.</b><br/><br/>

			The owners and publishers of Snopes.com are well known jews who would lie at the drop of a hat
			to protct their tribe. Since it is jew bankers who have the most to gain by perpetrating the 
			AMERO switch outlined in the story below, the kikes at Snopes have every reason to spin this story; 
			to help their rich jew pals deceive!<br/><br/>

			I personally vouch for this story and stand-by every world of it no matter how many
			filthy jews come out of the woodwork to say otherwise.  <b>I caught them and they know it.</b><br/><br/>

			So upset are the powers-that-be over this expose, they actually CLOSED THE DENVER MINT to the public
			so they can move the AMEROS out without being seen!<br/><br/>

			This from the Denver Mint Web Site:<br/>
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20070911072115/http://www.halturnershow.com/DenverMintStopsPublicToursToHideAmeros.jpg"><img height="271" src="http://web.archive.org/web/20070911072115im_/http://www.halturnershow.com/DenverMintStopsPublicToursToHideAmeros.jpg" width="478"/></a><br/><br/>

			My story has caused a huge amount of fallout for the folks trying to perpetrate this AMERO switch
			and they are doing everything possible to spin it, cover it up and say it isn't so.<br/><br/>

<h2>"THE AMERO" IS REAL;<br/>
			 I HAVE ONE TO PROVE IT!</h2>
<h4>UNITED STATES, CANADA AND MEXICO TO BE <u>MERGED</u> INTO SINGLE NEW ENTITY
			 NAMED NORTH AMERICAN UNION!</h4>
<p><b>By:  Hal Turner</b><br/><br/>
</p><p>Three weeks ago, I published a brief snippet on the front page of my web site
			reporting the governments of the US Canada and Mexico are conspiring in secret to merge
			the three nations into a new entity called the North American Union.<br/><br/>

			There has been much talk of this on various internet blogs for over a year.  Most of those
			blogs have been smeared as "conspiracy theorists" and have been largely ignored by the
			main stream.<br/><br/>

			What prompted my interest in the issue was money:  I was sent professional images 
			of actual AMERO coins by someone in the US Treasury!  The person included a note
			saying they like my radio show and are frightened by what's been going on
			in secret within our government.<br/><br/>

			This Treasury Department person was outraged that our country was beginning to coin money
			as part of a merger that would do away with our country,  via a merger the American public 
			knew nothing about!<br/><br/>

			When I got the professional images of the AMERO coin, I was finally intrigued enough to
			make mention of it on my web site.  My site has gotten over 20 Million visits in the last
			couple years and is becoming more popular because of the brutal honesty and timely delivery
			of news that folks don't find elsewhere.  This story about AMERO coins would fit
			my niche of breaking news, so I ran a snippet of a story.<br/><br/>

			As part of my report, I included the professional images sent to me by the Treasury
			person.  They appear below:<br/><br/>
<img src="http://web.archive.org/web/20070911072115im_/http://www.halturnershow.com/20AmeroCoin.jpg"/><br/><br/>
<img src="http://web.archive.org/web/20070911072115im_/http://www.halturnershow.com/100AmeroCoin.jpg"/><br/><br/>

			I also mentioned that very pricey "Collector Proofs" of the coins were also being Minted
			in Silver and Gold, and I posted an image of one such Silver Proof, shown below:<br/><br/>
<img src="http://web.archive.org/web/20070911072115im_/http://www.halturnershow.com/PureSilver100AmeroCoin.jpg"/><br/><br/>

			The story went on to say that the US Government has intentionally overspent itself for the 
			purpose of irreversibly Bankrupting the country.  The idea is that they will drive the country into
			economic failure, then when millions of Americans are panicking at the prospect, offer them
			a solution of merging the three countries as "the only possible way" to avoid losing everything.<br/><br/>

			They will force Canada into the merger by telling them the US currency they hold and rely upon will be worthless
			and the only way Canada can even hope to salvage any of the funds is to join the NAU.<br/><br/>

			They will sell it to the Mexican people by saying it will instantly improve their buying-power
			and quality of life.<br/><br/>

			In reality, the value of the US and Canadian dollars will be significantly reduced to counter 
			the worthless peso being absorbed.  People in the US and Canada will suffer great financial loss
			while Mexicans will see significant gain.  In the meantime, the financial elite and the politicians
			they own will make out like bandits!<br/><br/>

			That's the reason politicians are doing this: to get rich for themselves and their financial elite pals.<br/><br/>

			The folks in power within government and their buddies in Banking and finance know that 
			in any currency switch, some lose big while others gain big.  Really big!  In fact, folks 
			with foreknowledge of such a switch can make hundreds-of-millions, perhaps even billions 
			for themselves overnight.  Those without foreknowledge (common folks like you and me) 
			usually end up being wiped out.<br/><br/>
</p><h4>INSTANT, FULL BLAST "SPIN"</h4><br/><br/>
<p>I published the images and the small story and went to bed.  I had no idea what my
			little story would do.<br/><br/>

			Within a matter of hours, there was a full blown effort to discredit my story and the
			images as fake.<br/><br/>

			I was accused of lying.  I was accused of having "photoshopped" the images by creating them
			in Adobe Photoshop.<br/><br/>

			Within a couple days, a basic web site for AMERO "FANTASY COINS" was erected on the internet and
			word of that site was spread quickly.  The site contained the same images as I had run
			on my front page, so clearly whatever "SPIN" was happening was being driven by others who also
			had the professional images.<br/><br/>

			There was intense effort to claim the whole idea of these coins was a fantasy and there was
			absolutely no truth to them whatsoever. That effort to "spin" the story out of existence worked.
			Folks quickly lost interest.  I did not.<br/><br/>
</p><h4>Get me the real thing by any means necessary</h4><br/><br/>
<p>I reached out to the person in the Treasury who first alerted me to the coins.  That person told
			me "The shit hit the fan around here when your story ran."  The person went on to say "They 
			told everyone in all the Mints that anyone revealing information about the AMERO would be fired
			and perhaps even criminally prosecuted for endangering national security."<br/><br/>

			Ahhhh yes, the grand old catch-all of national security.  When they wheel that one out, you
			just KNOW they're pissed off about something!<br/><br/>

			I told the Treasury person that the only way anyone might believe this is happening, is for
			me to actually get one of the coins.  The Treasury guy balked.  He said "there's no way to
			get one without stealing it." <br/><br/>

			I though about that for a moment. . . . . then decided that if my government is concealing
			the actual Minting of coins for a new sovereign entity which may end up with power over me,
			but which I haven't been told about, then that government deserves whatever gets done to it.<br/><br/>

			I told the Treasury person to get me an Amero <u>by any means necessary</u> - even if that meant 
			stealing it.  The Treasury person said it would require them to think about for awhile and
			if it could be done, I would get one in the mail. <br/><br/>

			I waited.  And waited.  Frankly, after about three weeks, I lost track of the story -- until today.  
			A <u><b>real</b></u> AMERO coin arrived at my home in the mail this afternoon!<br/><br/>
</p><h4>The real thing arrives!</h4>
<p>Today, I received a single 20 AMERO coin in the mail.  A real coin.  Real metal, really MINTED by
			the US Mint in Denver, CO. The proof that it is being Minted in Denver is that the coin is stamped 
			with the Mint Identity letter <b>"D"</b> on the <u>bottom right of the side with the eagle</u> just like
			regular US coins already in circulation today!<br/><br/>

<b><i>Please note the letter "D" stamped below and to the right of the Planet earth at the bottom 
			right of the coin in this photo.  That "D" stands for the United States Mint at Denver, CO.</i></b><br/><br/>
</p><h1>VIDEO!</h1><br/>
<p>So that you can see this is a real, metal coin, I have made a small video of me holding the coin,
			turning it, then dropping it on a wooden table top so you can hear what it sounds like when it hits.<br/>
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20070911072115/http://www.halturnershow.com/The-Amero.wmv">Download the Windows Media Video here</a><br/><br/>
</p><h4>I WAS RIGHT!</h4><br/>
<p>I stand vindicated.  All those who claimed I fabricated the images now owe me an apology.  All those
			who claimed these were "fantasy" coins can now explain why anyone in their right mind would spend 
			Millions of dollars to create the rare and expensive professional dies and plates necessary for 
			minting coins that will not be issued?  <br/><br/>

			The simple truth is, the coins are real.  The plan to merge the US, Canada and Mexico is real.  Our
			government is lying about it and the fact they are minting money at the Denver Mint bearing the
			name of Union of North America is proof.<br/><br/>

			So America, Canada and Mexico, our governments are betraying us and planning
			to merge our countries without our knowledge or consent, or by financial disaster they
			bring-on intentionally.  What are we going to do about it?<br/><br/>

			For my part, the Second Amendment comes to mind.<br/><br/>

<p>North Carolina has become the first U.S. state to place the logo of the yet-to-be-formed "North

			bearing the logo of the North American Union.<br/><br/>

			Gee, now all the morons who screamed at me claiming the AMERO coins were a "fantasy coin"
