<pre><b><font size="2">S<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">ome background on our Breakfast Speaker, the Rev. Dr. Fred Craddock</font></font></b></pre>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">The Interfaith Children's 
    Movement of Metro Atlanta is fortunate indeed to have the Rev. Dr. Fred Craddock 
    as the speaker at its "Walk the Talk with Children" Breakfast. Newsweek 
    Magazine named him as one of the twelve best living preachers. The fact that 
    fellow clergy consistently vote him one of the most outstanding preachers 
    of our time says much about his stature. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">For more than three decades 
    Fred Craddock has enlightened, delighted, compelled and most of all engaged 
    listeners with his stories. His art of storytelling is weaved throughout his 
    lectures, and in his appearance with ICMma, we may expect him to help us all 
    see our responsibility for the well-being of children in a new light.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">"I attended a preaching 
    seminar with him some years ago," says ICMma Board member, Rev. Suzanne 
    Meyer. "He is not a physically imposing man like a TV preacher, nor does 
    he have a booming voice. But Fred makes everybody's list of top preachers. 
    I think it's because he is so authentic, so completely natural in an age of 
    hype and flash and dazzle. When he speaks, you know he is speaking to you 
    out of his own faith and experience. He does not preach in the style of those 
    who shout and pound the pulpit. He's a story teller who puts you in the story. 
    You forget you are listening to a lecture, and you find yourself opening up 
    to that still small voice of conscience within." </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Dr. Fred B. Craddock is 
    minister of Cherry Log Christian Church in Cherry Log Georgia. </font></p>

    at Southern Seminary and Earl Lectures at Pacific School of Religion. Dr. 
    Craddock has traveled the World giving lectures in many Countries. </font></p>

    in the "Great Preachers" and the "Great Teachers" series 
    of the Children's Defense Fund's Samuel D. Proctor Institute for Child Advocacy 
    Ministry.</font></p>
