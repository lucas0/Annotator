<blockquote><p>You're all familiar with the Christmas song, "The Twelve Days of Christmas" I think. To most it's a delightful nonsense rhyme set to music. But it had a quite serious purpose when it was written.</p><p>It is a good deal more than just a repetitious melody with pretty phrases and a list of strange gifts.</p><p>Catholics in England during the period 1558 to 1829, when Parliament finally emancipated Catholics in England, were prohibited from ANY practice of their faith by law - private OR public. It was a crime to BE a Catholic. </p></blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>"The Twelve Days of Christmas" was written in England as one of the "catechism songs" to 
help young Catholics learn the tenets of their faith - a memory aid, when to be caught with 
anything in *writing* indicating adherence to the Catholic faith could not only get you 
imprisoned, it could get you hanged, or shortened by a head - or hanged, drawn and 
quartered, a rather peculiar and ghastly punishment I'm not aware was ever practiced 
anywhere else. Hanging, drawing and quartering involved hanging a person by the neck until 
they had almost, but not quite, suffocated to death; then the party was taken down from the 
gallows, and disembowelled while still alive; and while the entrails were still lying on the 
street, where the executioners stomped all over them, the victim was tied to four large farm 
horses, and literally torn into five parts - one to each limb and the remaining torso.</p>
<p>The songs gifts are hidden meanings to the teachings of the faith. The "true love" mentioned 
in the song doesn't refer to an earthly suitor, it refers to God Himself. The "me" who 
receives the presents refers to every baptized person. The partridge in a pear tree is Jesus 
Christ, the Son of God. In the song, Christ is symbolically presented as a mother partridge 
which feigns injury to decoy predators from her helpless nestlings, much in memory of the 
expression of Christ's sadness over the fate of Jerusalem: "Jerusalem! Jerusalem! How often 
would I have sheltered thee under my wings, as a hen does her chicks, but thou wouldst not 
have it so..."</p>
<p>The other symbols mean the following:</p>
<p>2 Turtle Doves = The Old and New Testaments<br/>
3 French Hens = Faith, Hope and Charity, the Theological Virtues<br/>
4 Calling Birds = the Four Gospels and/or the Four Evangelists<br/>
5 Golden Rings = The first Five Books of the Old Testament, the "Pentateuch", which gives 
the history of man's fall from grace.<br/>
6 Geese A-laying = the six days of creation<br/>
7 Swans A-swimming = the seven gifts of the Holy Spirit, the seven sacraments<br/>
8 Maids A-milking = the eight beatitudes<br/>
9 Ladies Dancing = the nine Fruits of the Holy Spirit<br/>
10 Lords A-leaping = the ten commandments<br/>
11 Pipers Piping = the eleven faithful apostles<br/>
12 Drummers Drumming = the twelve points of doctrine in the Apostle's Creed</p>

<blockquote>P.S. It has come to our attention that this tale is made up of both fact and fiction.  Hopefully it will be accepted in the spirit it was written.  As an encouragement to people to keep their faith alive, when it is easy, and when any outward expressions of their faith could mean their life. Today there are still people living under similar conditions, may this tale give them courage, and determination to use any creative means at their disposal to keep their faith alive.</blockquote>
