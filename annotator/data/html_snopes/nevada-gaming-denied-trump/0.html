<br/>Knight Ridder/Tribune Business News 
<p>Feb. 5, 2004 - CARSON CITY, Nev. -- After years of discussion about
moving into the state, New York developer and casino owner Donald Trump
easily won support from state regulators Wednesday for his licensing as
a gaming operator. 
</p><p>Trump, who said he is eyeing a number of opportunities in Las Vegas
and elsewhere in Nevada, was unanimously recommended for licensing by the
Gaming Control Board after a brief hearing. 
</p><p>Trump said he is considering real estate and gaming projects in Las
Vegas and that a Trump Tower residential development is a possibility.
A Trump Tower project in Las Vegas probably would be exclusively residential,
he said. 
</p><p>"Everywhere I do a Trump Tower it's a smash hit," Trump said. "I really
want to do something spectacular in Las Vegas and Nevada. I do have plans
for Las Vegas. I do have plans perhaps for Nevada, generally," he said. 
</p><p>"My real estate empire is far larger than my gaming empire. I'm a real
estate person first. But I see myself doing real estate. I also see myself
doing gaming." 
</p><p>Trump would not be more specific about his plans but said news of what
he has in mind probably will emerge over the next 12 months. 
</p><p>"I'd rather not comment because of the fact that I don't want to increase
my price," he said. "We're looking sort of at a lot of different things." 
</p><p>Trump said he is talking to New Frontier owner Phil Ruffin about a possible
development on the 40-acre site on the Strip. But, he said, he is looking
elsewhere as well. 
</p><p>"That's one of them," he said of the Ruffin project. "There are many
opportunities in Las Vegas. There are many things that are available." 
</p><p>Published reports of Trump's imminent arrival in Las Vegas date back
to 1986, when then-Review-Journal columnist Ned Day said the developer
had tried to acquire land at the southwest corner of Spring Mountain Road
and the Strip from the Summa Corp., now known as The Howard Hughes Corp. 
</p><p>That site instead was purchased by Trump's longtime feuding partner,
Las Vegas casino developer Steve Wynn, who opened The Mirage there in 1989,
followed by the adjacent Treasure Island four years later. 
</p><p>In 1986, Trump was linked to a failed takeover of Bally Manufacturing
Corp., which at the time owned two Nevada hotel-casinos, including Bally's
Las Vegas, as well as separate efforts to buy the Dunes and Desert Inn
properties. 
</p><p>A year later, Trump reportedly was chasing control of the Golden Nugget,
saying at the time, "I've always wanted Stephen Wynn to work for me." But
none of those deals, or several others that followed, were ever finalized. 
</p><p>Trump's relationship with Wynn reportedly has warmed in recent years.
A call from Trump last summer supposedly convinced Wynn to dump his project's
erstwhile title, Le Reve, and Trump in 2002 told the Review-Journal he
and Wynn were "friends now." 
</p><p>However, the big-name developers at times have resembled anything but
bosom buddies. 
</p><p>Nearly four years ago, the men settled a long-standing lawsuit that
started shortly after Wynn's former company, Mirage Resorts, in the mid-1990s
announced plans to build a large resort in Trump's casino stronghold, Atlantic
City. 
</p><p>Allegations from both sides quickly followed, ranging from charges that
Trump used illegal political influence in an attempt to keep Wynn out of
the area to countercharges that a Trump-hired agent tallied the gambling
habits of Wynn's mother, among other low points. 
</p><p>At one point, Wynn described the reported actions of Trump's company
as "the most outrageous misconduct, the most flagrant violations of law
and decent behavior in the history of the resort hotel industry," according
to a March 2000 article published by Knight Ridder Newspapers. 
</p><p>Trump's attorneys countered with references to Judas Iscariot and a
"Faustian deal" with the devil linked to a onetime Trump mole Wynn's company
allegedly turned. 
</p><p>A 1996 story in the Wall Street Journal traced the feud back further,
claiming the animosity first came to a head in 1985 when Trump purchased
a new Hilton hotel in Atlantic City around the time Wynn's bid to buy Hilton
Hotel Corp. came up short. 
</p><p>Another reported dispute arose over a planned 1990 heavyweight boxing
event Wynn hosted at The Mirage that allegedly interfered with a contract
between Trump and promoter Don King, who held the rights to then-champion
James "Buster" Douglas. 
</p><p>Wynn reportedly was traveling Wednesday and unavailable for comment. 
</p><p>Trump and his companies, Trump Hotels &amp; Casino Resorts Inc. and
the THCR Holding Corp., were required to be licensed by gaming regulators
in Nevada after he purchased 358,000 shares of Riviera parent Riviera Holdings
Corp. 
</p><p>The purchase, made about a year ago, put him over a threshold requiring
investigation and licensure by Nevada gaming regulators. 
</p><p>Trump and the other officers of his companies will appear at the Gaming
Commission meeting in the capital on Feb. 19 for final approval. 
</p><p>Gaming Control Board Chairman Dennis Neilander said the investigations
of Trump and his executive team gave the board no need to ask any personal
questions at the hearing. 
</p><p>He called the applications "very clean" and said he was impressed with
the backgrounds of some of Trump's personnel. 
</p><p>One of the directors recommended for licensing, Don Thomas, is a former
chairman of New Jersey's Casino Control Commission. 
</p><p>Members of the control board asked Trump and his executives about problems
with minors gaining entry to his New Jersey properties, but Chief Operating
Officer Mark Brown said the company is making every effort to control the
problem. 
</p><p>Trump said it is difficult when a patron looks 30 but is actually 17
years old. 
</p><p>Control Board member Scott Scherer noted that New Jersey gaming authorities
appear to be cracking down hard on minors in all casinos. 
</p><p>Neilander said minors gaining access to casinos is a problem everywhere,
especially in Nevada where properties were built before casino designs
were required to more strictly separate gaming areas from movie theaters
and other areas open to underage visitors. 
</p><p>Trump has talked for years about moving into the Las Vegas casino industry,
but his expected licensing by the end of the month will make it much easier
to put deals together. 
</p><p>Trump's gaming empire is primarily in New Jersey with the Trump Plaza,
Trump Marina and Trump Taj Mahal casino hotels in Atlantic City. But he
also has a riverboat operation in Indiana and operates a casino near Palm
Springs with the Twenty-Nine Palms Band of Luiseno Mission Indians. 
</p><p>Trump said after the hearing that he is talking with people about other
Indian gaming projects and that more are likely on the horizon for his
company. 
</p><p>The growth of Indian gaming must be watched, but Trump said Las Vegas
should do well regardless. 
</p><p>"It could have an impact certainly on Las Vegas and Nevada, but you've
got a tremendous infrastructure here and I think it will be fine," he said. 
</p><p>Gaming Wire reporter Chris Jones contributed to this report.
