Below you will find an editorial reprinted from an archived <i>Daily Texan</i> addressing an URBAN LEGEND concerning our coverage of a kidney story.
</p><hr/><p>
<b>Monday 09-Dec-1996</b>
</p><h2>VIEWPOINT</h2>
We love a good joke as much as anybody. After all, who didn't laugh when they heard the one about the priest, the minister, the rabbi and the Aggie?<p>
Some things, however, are not funny.</p><p>
<i>The Texan</i> has been receiving substantial amounts of e-mail lately regarding a story that allegedly came from our pages.</p><p>
The story begins by saying that it takes place at Fall Premier, which hasn't happened for as long as anyone can remember. According to the e-mails, this unnamed guy goes to a party where he meets a woman. They leave the party and end up at a second one where the still unnamed guy has a few more drinks.</p><p>
He wakes up in the morning in a strange bathtub filled with ice. He is naked and there is a message written on his chest in lipstick, which says, "Call 911 or you will die." He sees a phone nearby and calls 911.</p><p>
They tell him to get out of the bathtub and examine himself in the mirror. He reports that everything seems fine. Until he looks at his back, where he has two 9-inch incisions. EMS tells him to get back in the bathtub.</p><p>
Allegedly, his kidneys were removed and sold on the black market, for the alleged price of $10,000 each.</p><p>
The story goes on to hypothesize that medical students were probably involved in the second party and the kidney removal.</p><p>
First of all, as most of you know, there is no medical school at the University of Texas at Austin.</p><p>
Second, kidney removal is a difficult procedure. Since the kidneys are a blood filtration system, they are attached to several large blood vessels. Amateur work would almost certainly result in a loss of life.</p><p>
The e-mailed pseudo-story continues. Allegedly, the guy is now on life support and both the University and Baylor University Medical Center are conducting tissue research to find a donor.</p><p>
This tugged at the heartstrings of several who saw the message. We have received several queries about establishing a fund to defray medical costs for the student. No fund exists because, to the extent of our research, the story never happened. It certainly <b>WAS NOT</b> reported by <i>The Daily Texan.</i></p><p>
Several versions of this story attribute it to a woman the writers call the editor of <i>The Texan</i>. She is not the editor, nor has she ever been.</p><p>
This "joke" is an assault on the credibility of not only <i>The Texan</i> but also the University -- an assault we don't take lightly. There is absolutely no way to fix the unnecessary bad public relations that this "joke" has caused the University. Even as false as it is, this piece will be part of many people's image of the University.</p><p>
The proper authorities have been notified.</p><p>
We are taking this seriously, as we would anything that impugns the reputation of <i>The Texan</i> and the University of Texas community. You can help us. If you get this message e-mailed to you, set the record straight and tell these jokers not to quit their day jobs.</p><p>
