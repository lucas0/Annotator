<tt><pre><h1>INTRODUCTION</h1></pre></tt>
<tt><pre>The Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) is dreaded by high school juniors and seniors
because a single <u>SAT</u>urday morning can ruin the rest of their lives!

This article describes my system for getting extraordinary raw scores on this
challenging test.  Rather than fight the test, I use the SAT's difficulty to my
advantage, leveraging down to a new, elite level of distinction:

<h2>Answering <u>all</u> questions <u><i>in</i>correctly</u>!</h2>

On 2003 April 5th, a Saturday, at the age of 33, I threw away my dignity, mocked
my Ivy League education, disgraced my Master's degree, and proved, in just over
three hours, that humans can do things "The System" didn't anticipate.  Things
didn't turn out exactly as planned, but it was a <i>crazy</i> experience!

<tt><pre><h1>THE SCHOLASTIC APTITUDE TEST (SAT)</h1></pre></tt>
<tt><pre>The Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) is a test of mathematical and verbal
intelligence.  This test was created by the College Entrance Examination Board
(CEEB), and was administered for the first time in June 1926 to 8,040 people.
In the 2000-2001 test year, more than 2.1 million people took the "SAT I:
Reasoning Test" as part of the admission process for more than 1,000 
institutions of higher education, 80 percent of the national (U.S.) total.

All references to "SAT" in this article refer to the "SAT I: Reasoning Test".

</pre><table bgcolor="#ffffff" border="1" cellpadding="20"><tbody><tr><td><font color="#000000"><pre><p>
  <u>What does the SAT stand for?</u>
  (From College Board literature)
  "Originally, SAT was an acronym for the Scholastic Aptitude Test.
  In 1993, the test was renamed the SAT I: Reasoning Test. At the
  same time, the former Achievement Tests were renamed the SAT II:
  Subject Tests. SAT has become a simple way of referring to the
  SAT I: Reasoning Test."
</p></pre></font></td></tr></tbody></table><br/>

The College Board has a page describing the fascinating history of the SAT:
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20071212180905/http://www.collegeboard.com/about/newsat/history.html" target="_blank">http://www.collegeboard.com/about/newsat/history.html</a>

The SAT is given seven times a year at thousands of testing centers throughout
the world.  Unless there are special circumstances, the test is given on a
Saturday, starting at approximately 9:00 A.M. in each time zone.

<table bgcolor="#ffffff" border="1" cellpadding="20"><tbody><tr><td><font color="#000000"><pre><p>
<u>Cheating on the SAT!</u>
In the United States there is a three-hour time zone difference 
between the East Coast and the West Coast.  At one time this 
created a SAT cheating opportunity:  Professional test-takers on
the East Coast would steal or memorize test materials, and relay
this information to student test-takers on the West Coast.  One
business apparently flew students to the West Coast to take
advantage of this possibility.

These days, with Infra-Red ports on calculators and wristwatches,
hands-free earpieces and digital video on mobile phones, cheap
wireless cameras that can be planted anywhere in a room or on a
person, I'm sure there must be someone out there who had a whole
support team helping him through the test!  Wouldn't it be
hilarious to have an Internet chat room or instant messaging
group helping one through the SAT!  The transcript would be
damaging evidence, though.

Undoubtedly other people have simply exited the test room with the
test booklet and answer sheet, worked on the test with a group of
smart friends and a dictionary, and returned discreetly, perhaps
with some sort of distraction.

It would be ironic for cheaters to get admitted to Harvard
and one day learn the school motto: "Veritas" (Truth).
</p></pre></font></td></tr></tbody></table><br/>

The testing part of the SAT lasts a total of exactly three hours.
There are seven timed sections:

<table bgcolor="#ffffff" border="1" cellpadding="20"><tbody><tr><td><font color="#000000"><pre><p>
(1) 30-minute Verbal
(2) 30-minute Verbal
(3) 30-minute Math
(4) 30-minute Math
(5) 30-minute Equating Section (Verbal or Math)
(6) 15-minute Verbal
(7) 15-minute Math
</p></pre></font></td></tr></tbody></table><br/>

The 30-minute sections can appear in any order.  Test proctors need to indicate
when to start and stop for all sections, so it is necessary for all test-takers
in a testing room to encounter each of the two 15-minute sections at the same
time.  For my test group, both 15-minute sections occurred in the final 30 
minutes of the three-hour testing period.

The following table describes various properties of the sections:

<table bgcolor="#ffffff" border="1" cellpadding="20"><tbody><tr><td><font color="#000000"><pre><p>
Verbal Sections:
================
  * 75 minutes total (30 min + 30 min + 15 min)
  * 78 questions total:
        40 Critical Reading     (5-choice)
        19 Analogies            (5-choice)
        19 Sentence Completion  (5-choice)


Math Sections:
==============
  * 75 minutes total (30 min + 30 min + 15 min)
  * 60 questions total:
        35 Standard                   (5-choice)
        15 Quantitative Comparisons   (4-choice)
        10 Student-produced responses (NO-choice)
      Or, by question type:
        44 Arithmetic and Algebraic Reasoning
        14 Geometric Reasoning


Equating Section:
=================
  * 30 minutes total
  * Used to test new questions, and compare
     editions of the exam
  * Does NOT count toward final score
  * Is NOT explicitly identified to test-takers,
      and looks exactly like an ordinary Verbal
      or Math section; thus, taken with the
      same seriousness as "real" sections

<tt><pre><h1>CALCULATING THE TEST SCORE</h1></pre></tt>
<tt><pre><h2><u>Two Divisions: Math and Verbal</u></h2></pre></tt>
<tt><pre>The SAT has two divisions: Math and Verbal.  A score report has performance
statistics for the math division, and performance statistics for the verbal
division.
</pre></tt>
<tt><pre><h2><u>Three Statistics for each Division</u></h2></pre></tt>
<tt><pre>Performance on each division of the SAT is described by three statistics:

</pre><table bgcolor="#ffffff" border="1" cellpadding="20"><tbody><tr><td><font color="#000000"><pre><p>
(1) Raw Score;
(2) Scaled Score;
(3) Relative Percentage;
</p></pre></font></td></tr></tbody></table><br/>

Almost all statements regarding "SAT Score" are implicitly referring to the
Scaled Score.
</tt>
<tt><pre><h2>(1) <u>Raw Score</u></h2></pre></tt>
<tt><pre><u>Raw Score</u> is an integer (whole number) that is calculated for each
division of the test.

Applying the following rules to the set of answers for a division of a test
will yield a number (potentially non-integer) that will be the basis of the
Raw Score:

</pre><table bgcolor="#ffffff" border="1" cellpadding="20"><tbody><tr><td><font color="#000000"><pre><p>
(a) Ignore each blank answer (often called an "omitted question");
(b) Ignore each incorrect answer for math questions requiring
        "student-produced" (non-multiple-choice) responses;
(c) Add one point for each correct answer;
(d) Subtract 1/4-point for each incorrect answer for multiple-choice
        questions having 5 choices;
(e) Subtract 1/3-point for each incorrect answer for multiple-choice
        questions having 4 choices;
</p></pre></font></td></tr></tbody></table><br/>

The <u>Raw Score</u> is the number computed directly above rounded to the
"nearest integer".

<table bgcolor="#ffffff" border="1" cellpadding="20"><tbody><tr><td><font color="#000000"><pre><p>
<u>Mathematical Detour: All Possible Fractional Values</u>

The calculation of the integer <u>Raw Score</u> involves
rounding a potentially non-integer value to the "nearest
integer".  It so happens there are twelve (12) cases of
the fractional part:
   
  FRACTIONAL PART        EXAMPLE       ROUNDING
===================  =============== ============
 0/12 = 0.0          (0-(0/4)-(0/3))    None
 1/12 = 0.083333...  (1-(1/4)-(2/3))    Down
 2/12 = 0.166666...  (1-(2/4)-(1/3))    Down
 3/12 = 0.25         (1-(3/4)-(0/3))    Down
 4/12 = 0.333333...  (1-(0/4)-(2/3))    Down
 5/12 = 0.416666...  (1-(1/4)-(1/3))    Down
 6/12 = 0.5          (1-(2/4)-(0/3))     Up &lt;-- Look!
 7/12 = 0.583333...  (2-(3/4)-(2/3))     Up
 8/12 = 0.666666...  (1-(0/4)-(1/3))     Up
 9/12 = 0.75         (1-(1/4)-(0/3))     Up
10/12 = 0.833333...  (2-(2/4)-(2/3))     Up
11/12 = 0.916666...  (2-(3/4)-(1/3))     Up

If J is an integer, (J + 0.5) is equidistant from
two integers: J and (J+1).

Obviously the CEEB needs to specify what to do in 
this special case -- and it must be deterministic
(so random rounding and alternate rounding cannot
be used).

One candidate convention, called "Banker's Rounding",
rounds to the nearest EVEN number (e.g., 0.5 --&gt; 0;
1.5 --&gt; 2; -11.5 --&gt; -12).

Another convention is to round to the nearest integer,
and round UPWARD for the ambiguous case of (J + 0.5).
(e.g., 0.5 --&gt; 1; 1.5 --&gt; 2; -11.5 --&gt; -11)  This is
what the "FIX" function does for 0.5 on scientific
calculators ({2nd,FIX,0,0.5,=} --&gt; 1).  This is the
convention used by the CEEB, as described by this
quote:

  "If the resulting [raw] score is a fraction,
   it is rounded to the nearest whole number
   -- 1/2 or more is rounded up; 
    less than 1/2 is rounded down."

Keep in mind that rounding up for 1/2 is not the
<i>definition</i> of "nearest whole number"; this quote is
merely describing the convention used by the CEEB.
</p></pre></font></td></tr></tbody></table><br/>
<u>Verbal Division Raw Score Range</u>

The Verbal Division has three question categories:

  =======================================================================
  Question Type        Questions       Min Raw Score        Max Raw Score
  =======================================================================
  Critical Reading    :    40   : -40/4 = -10   --&gt; -10  :      +40
  Analogies           :    19   : -19/4 = -4.75 --&gt;  -5  :      +19
  Sentence Completion :    19   : -19/4 = -4.75 --&gt;  -5  :      +19
  =======================================================================
  (NOTE: All questions are five-choice types.)

These three raw scores are reported on the printed score report.  Note that
(-10-5-5) = -20, whereas (-78/4) = -19.5 --&gt; -19.  Which method is used to
compute the raw score for the verbal division?  Who knows!  But it could make
a significant difference in scaled score.

<u>Math Division Raw Score Range</u>

The Math Division has two question types:

  =======================================================================
  Question Type        Questions       Min Raw Score        Max Raw Score
  =======================================================================
  Arithmetic and   
   Algebraic Reasoning :   44   :        -10             :      +44
  Geometric Reasoning  :   14   :       &lt; -1             :      +14
  =======================================================================

These two raw scores are reported on the printed score report.  I am not sure
how the 35 five-choice, 15 four-choice, and 10 student-response questions are
distributed between these two categories, so I cannot show the calculations.
Again, I am not sure if these two raw score values are added to yield an 
overall division raw score, or if all questions for the entire math division 
are considered together as in (0-35*(1/4)-15*(1/3)-10*0) = -13.75 --&gt; -14
for computing the scaled score.

</tt>
<tt><pre><h2>(2) <u>Scaled Score</u></h2></pre></tt>
<tt><pre>The <u>Scaled Score</u> is intended to be a measurement of ability on an absolute
scale.  In principle, the Scaled Score enables the objective comparison of
test-taker abilities throughout the history and future of the SAT, regardless
of variations in the difficulty of each edition of the test.

A Raw Score is converted to a Scaled Score through a statistical process called
"equating".  Equating may involve correlating performances between different
questions, and to the same questions or similar questions on past editions of
the SAT.

If the equating process works, and Scaled Scores are an absolute measure of
ability, then Scaled Scores for a particular edition of the SAT do not depend
on the relative performances of test-takers for that edition.

The Scaled Score is a multiple of 10 in the range 200 to 800.

<img src="http://replay.waybackmachine.org/web/20071212180905im_/http://colinfahey.com/oldpages/2003apr5_sat/sat_score_graph01.jpg"/>
FIGURE: An example conversion of Raw Score to Scaled Score
        (based on example data published by the College Board).

According to these example curves, one actually needs to get <i>at least</i>
seven questions wrong (approximately) in each division to have a chance at the
lowest possible scaled scores.

</pre><table bgcolor="#ffffff" border="1" cellpadding="20"><tbody><tr><td><font color="#000000"><pre><p>
<u>Is it true that you get a 200 on the SAT just for signing your name?</u>
(From College Board literature)

"Theoretically speaking, if you just sign your name and don't complete
the answer sheet, you would get a score of 200. That's because we
don't report scores that are lower than 200. In reality, if we
received an answer sheet that wasn't filled out, it would be
considered an automatic request to cancel scores and no scores would
be reported."
</p></pre></font></td></tr></tbody></table><br/>

I believe that the first sentence in the quote above is not correct, because it
is possible for the conversion curves to yield scaled scores higher than 200 on
each division for raw scores of zero (as would result from leaving all answer
bubbles blank).  Although I think the quote is ambiguous, I take it to mean 
that leaving all answer bubbles blank on the entire answer sheet (not simply 
all math or all verbal answers) would result in scores not being reported.
</tt>
<tt><pre><h2>(3) <u>Relative Percentage</u></h2></pre></tt>
<tt><pre>The <u>Relative Percentage</u> is an integer between 1 and 99 that indicates,
for each test-taker, the percentage of test-takers who earned a lower score.

The percentages are based on: "the most recent scores earned by current-year
college-bound seniors who took the test at any time during high school."

Relative Percentages are given for the nation and state.

</pre><table bgcolor="#ffffff" border="1" cellpadding="20"><tbody><tr><td><font color="#000000"><pre><p>
<u>Relative Percentage</u>

           (Number Of Test-Takers with a Lower Score)
Fraction = ------------------------------------------
                (Total Number of Test-Takers)

Relative Percentage = Max( 1, Min( 99, Round(100*Fraction) ))

<u>Lowest Percentile</u>

People who get the lowest possible scaled score <i>should</i> get a
relative percentage of "0", since it is impossible for any other 
student to have a "lower score".  But "1" is the lower limit on the
CEEB's relative percentage value.

<u>Highest Percentile</u>

People who get the highest possible score could, in principle, have
a relative percentage anywhere in the range 0 (nobody did worse),
to 99.999... (almost everyone did worse).  It cannot reach exactly
100.0 percent, given the definition, but rounding could round up to
100.  However, the CEEB limits are 1 percent to 99 percent.
</p></pre></font></td></tr></tbody></table><br/>
</tt>
<tt><pre><h2><u>Math Score + Verbal Score = Combined Score</u></h2></pre></tt>
<tt><pre>Adding the Scaled Score for the math division to the Scaled Score for the
verbal division yields a combined score.

Because each of the two Scaled Scores is a multiple of 10 in the range 200
to 800, the combined score is a multiple of 10 in the range 400 to 1600.

If a person fills out an SAT answer sheet with all required personal and site-
specific information, but doesn't answer a single question (i.e., "omits" all
questions), the person receives a combined score that can be as low as 400,
but is likely to be significantly higher (e.g., 470) based on the raw score to
scaled score conversion curves for that test edition.

It seems inevitable that every person who takes the SAT will contemplate what
it must take to "get a sixteen-hundred" (1600).  For some, it might be the only
chance to get admitted to an elite school.  For most, it's an urban legend.

In 2002, the average scores on the SAT were 504 verbal and 516 math,
a cumulative score of 1020.

<img src="http://replay.waybackmachine.org/web/20071212180905im_/http://colinfahey.com/oldpages/2003apr5_sat/world_almanac_2003_sat_scores01.jpg"/>
FIGURE: The World Almanac 2003; p.240; Table: SAT Mean Verbal and Math Scores
        of College-Bound Seniors, 1975-2002

Some universities specify an "average SAT combined score" in their admission
application materials.  It may not be legal for public colleges and universities
to establish minimum SAT combined score requirements, but private institutions,
like corporations, can set whatever standards they wish.
</pre></tt>
<tt><pre><h2><u>Score "Recentering": An Attempt to Establish<br/>Standard Scores</u></h2></pre></tt>
<tt><pre>Since the SAT was first administered in 1926, there have been over 20 different
sets of scales used to convert raw scores in to scaled scores, all in an effort
to better describe the abilities of people who take the test.

The most dramatic change in score calculation for the SAT in recent decades is
described by the following quote from the College Board:

    "In April 1995, the College Board recentered the score scales
    for all tests in the SAT Program to reflect the contemporary
    test-taking population. Recentering reestablished the average
    score for a study group of 1990 seniors at about 500 -- the 
    midpoint of the 200-to-800 scale -- allowing students, schools,
    and colleges to more easily interpret their scores in relation
    to those of a similar group of college-bound seniors."

One effect of recentering is that scores are apparently "inflated" relative to
scores before 1995.  For example, what would have been a 1490 cumulative (V+M)
score before 1995 is now called a 1600, the maximum possible score.  Put 
another way, a score of 1600 today could correspond to a score as low as 1490
for scales prior to 1995.  All scores, down to the lowest, are inflated
relative to historical counterparts.

The following page has a table that shows the effect of recentering on 
cumulative (V+M) scores:
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20071212180905/http://www.collegeboard.com/sat/cbsenior/equiv/rt027027.html" target="_blank">http://www.collegeboard.com/sat/cbsenior/equiv/rt027027.html</a>

The following is a fascinating research paper published by the College Board on
the theory and motivation for the recentering process:

<a href="http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20071212180905/http://colinfahey.com/oldpages/2003apr5_sat/original_2003apr5_sat.htm#the_sat/sat_recentering.pdf" target="_blank"><img src="http://replay.waybackmachine.org/web/20071212180905im_/http://colinfahey.com/oldpages/2003apr5_sat/sat_recentering_cover01.jpg"/></a>

If you read the research paper mentioned above, one gets a sense of the 
difficulties faced by the College Board in establishing a standard.  One can
find scandal in the paper if one is looking for it, and it is easy to see how
this complicated problem and associated solution could be regarded as more of
an art than a science.

</p><h3><u>High Intelligence Quotient (IQ) Organizations</u></h3>
Many high-intelligence organizations believe that there is enough
correlation between pre-1995 SAT scores and IQ to use those scores
alone as a qualification standard for membership.  For example, an
SAT combined score of 1250 (1974-1994 SAT editions) correlates
with a Stanford-Binet IQ of 132, the top 2% of humanity, and thus
qualifies a person for Mensa.

</pre><table bgcolor="#ffffff" border="1" cellpadding="20"><tbody><tr><td><font color="#000000"><pre><p>
In 1994, the SAT exam was greatly modified: antonym
questions were eliminated, the verbal section contained a
greater emphasis on reading, non-multiple-choice questions
were added to the math division, and it became permissible
to use electronic caculators for the math sections.

In 1995, CEEB started computing and reporting SAT scores
according to the "recentering" scale, as described in the
previous section.  Because of score inflation, and total
lack of ability to differentiate performance beyond a
moderately high level, SAT scores could no longer be
correlated to IQ with sufficient range or precision to
serve as a basis for admission to high-intelligence
organizations.
</p></pre></font></td></tr></tbody></table><br/>

Almost no high-intelligence organization accepts any post-1994 SAT
combined score as a basis for admission.  However, the Graduate
Record Exam (GRE) general test is currently accepted by many high-
intelligence organizations for admission.  Tests for the general
population are designed to magnify differences centered around 
average intelligence, so only a small fraction of the questions
can be allocated to differentiate between high levels of
intelligence.  Thus, specialized IQ tests are required to
accurately assess high intelligence.

The following are links to Mensa sites:

According to Mensa literature, "Mensa meetings are anything but
dull!"  Perhaps you will meet Marilyn Vos Savant, who is listed
in the Guinness Hall of Fame for the world's highest recorded
IQ (228).

Mensa is at the LOW end of the spectrum.  The <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20071212180905/http://www.gigasociety.org/" target="_blank">Giga Society</a> only
accepts people in the 99.9999999 percentile of human intelligence
( 1 / Billion, thus "Giga"), which corresponds to an IQ of 196.
Using the CIA's "The World Factbook 2002", and extrapolating to
today's date (2003/4/28), the world population is roughly
6,297,263,466.  For a Binomial probability distribution, the mean
is N*p, and the variance is N*p*(1-p).  Thus, one would expect the
Giga Society to have 6.3 members, give or take 6 members.
It now has at least 5 members.

I look at various IQ tests from time to time, and I am usually 
unimpressed with the "intelligence" being tested.  Here are sample
<i>verbal</i> questions from one "unofficial" IQ test:

  [1] 9         : 361  :: Tic-Tac-Toe : ____
  [2] Roosevelt : New  :: Truman      : ____
  [3] 5,280     : Mile :: 43,560      : ____
  [4] 753       : 776  :: Rome        : ____
  [5] Horse and Donkey : Mule :: 
       Question mark and Exclamation point : ____

Just for fun I decided to measure Google's "IQ"!  Acting as
Google's proxy for the IQ test, I found the following plausible
answers:

  [1] "Go"       : A Go board has 19 x 19 = 361 places to move,
                   and Tic-Tac-Toe has 9 places to move;
  [2] "Fair"     : Truman had a "FAIR Deal", and Roosevelt had
                   a "NEW Deal";
  [3] "Acre"     : There are 43,560 square feet in an acre, and
                   there are 5,280 feet in a mile;
  [4] "Olympics" : The Olympic games were founded in 776 BC,
                   and Rome was founded in 753 BC.
  [5] "Interrobang" : An "interrobang" is a character that
                   is a composite of the question mark and 
                   exclamation mark.  How silly is that?!
                   A mule is a "composite" of a horse and a donkey.

I seriously considered completing an IQ test using only
information yielded via Google searching (i.e., ignoring my own
knowledge), and paying for it to be scored, and then publicize
Google's "IQ".  Of course, any online article describing questions
missed by Google-brain will eventually be assimilated by Google.
It's interesting to think of static information as a given.
Suppose all of humanity were wired directly in to Google.
Suddenly, the novelty of trivia and languages vanishes.  Just as
"human calculators" were made obsolete by mechanical calculators,
future advances in technology may make other traditionally valued
forms of intelligence obsolete.  I happen to believe that the
future belongs to video games and infotainment.  If there weren't
so many cheaters and paid "farmers" around, I'd say that one's
"level" in EverQuest (EQ) could be correlated to this new
prioritized variety of "intelligence". ... Ha!  Had you going
there!  Or am I just creating plausible deniability for a
controversial idea?  Huh<i>[insert interrobang here]</i>

<tt><pre><h1>REGISTERING FOR THE TEST</h1></pre></tt>
<tt><pre>The SAT is given seven times each year.  Although you must register (enroll) 
with the College Board before a specific deadline to be assured the opportunity
to take the SAT on a specific date, there is a chance that you will be able to
simply show up at a designated test center on the morning of a test and sign up
to take the SAT.  There is no guarantee that the site will have spare test 
booklets and answer sheets, so it's a bit of a gamble.

Here are several fees that may interest a person planning to take the SAT I:

</pre><table bgcolor="#ffffff" border="1" cellpadding="20"><tbody><tr><td><font color="#000000"><pre><p>
(1) "SAT I: Reasoning Test"  : $26
    ==============================
    This is payment for the test.  Included in this price is the
    option to have up to four official score reports mailed to
    college and university admission programs of one's choice.
    (There is a charge for each additional score report if more
    than four are requested.  Score reports are only official if
    mailed directly from the College Board.)

(2) "Student Answer Service" : $ 6
    ==============================
    This is an optional report that shows you an enumerated list
    of questions, and whether your response was: correct (+),
    wrong (-), or omitted (O).

    Maybe this product exists to address possible paranoia about
    the Raw Score calculation.
    
(3) Detailed Answer Report   : $15
    ==============================
    This product is only offered on certain test dates.  This
    report shows the actual questions on the exam, your responses,
    the correct responses, and an analysis of your apparent
    strengths and weaknesses, which, in principle, could be used
    as a basis for deciding how to prepare for taking the test
    again.
</p></pre></font></td></tr></tbody></table><br/>

There are many other interesting products, like "Rush Reporting" to get your
official SAT scores mailed to colleges and universities sooner, "Additional
Score Reports" when you are applying to more than four institutions, and a
fee for a personal online peek at your scores a full ten days before they are
put in the mail, etc.  Perhaps the College Board will eventually offer more
exotic products:

<table bgcolor="#ffffff" border="1" cellpadding="20"><tbody><tr><td><font color="#000000"><pre><p>
(1) T-Shirts, bumper stickers, vanity plates, baseball caps, coffee
      mugs, greeting cards, playing cards, paper weights, bobble
      heads, flags, and web sites, all depicting your score report
      in a handsome way that is sure to grab attention.

(2) A score report tattooed on your ass or forehead, or burned in to
      your retina with a laser for a lifelong visual affirmation of
      your intelligence.

(3) Score reports containing "printing errors".  The College Board
      won't come right out and say what the nature of those errors
      might be, but will hint that such errors are often favorable,
      in logarithmic relation to your "donation level".

(5) Professional photographers will capture one's test-taking
      experience on four hours of digital video, followed by a 
      helicopter ride to the official "SAT Award Ceremony" at the 
      College Board compound on a remote tropical island paradise.
      After receiving a trophy, and shaking hands with some of the
      educational researchers who devised the latest batch of SAT
      questions, you will tour their secret underground facility,
      witness giant machines grading thousands of exams per second,
      and, after a few drinks, you become an honorary employee of
      the College Board, and have the authority to grade some poor
      soul's SAT by hand!  Of course this situation must be
      "contained", which means, umm, total erasure of all those
      involved, nuclear vaporization of all test centers, and
      installing Xa'Kel-6 as provisional leader of the Earth people.

Online registration for any College Board exam starts at their web site:
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20071212180905/http://www.collegeboard.com/" target="_blank">http://www.collegeboard.com</a>

After navigating a few menus, I started the registration process for the
"SAT I: Reasoning Test".

<img src="http://replay.waybackmachine.org/web/20071212180905im_/http://colinfahey.com/oldpages/2003apr5_sat/www_collegeboard_com_sat_form01.jpg"/>
FIGURE: Starting the SAT registration process.



The first phase is "signing up" with the College Board, which just involves
sharing basic information about oneself.  When one has finished with this
process, the following confirmation appears:

<img src="http://replay.waybackmachine.org/web/20071212180905im_/http://colinfahey.com/oldpages/2003apr5_sat/www_collegeboard_com_sat_confirm01.jpg"/>
FIGURE: "Sign Up" Confirmation

As you can see, I have selected the nickname "Tensai", which in Japanese
translates to both "Genius" and "Natural Disaster".  This is perfect for
my test-taking persona.  I recently noticed that "Tensai" is an anagram
of "SAT ein(s)", or "SAT 1" in German.  Coincidence?  Or destiny!



In the following you can see that I elected to order the "Student Answer
Service":

FIGURE: Ordering the "Student Answer Service".



The registration process includes many questions about one's high school career,
and it's hard to resist thinking that the College Board secretly uses this
information as part of their "equating" process, but that's how my paranoid,
cynical mind works.

As you can see, I decided that I wanted to hear from colleges, universities,
and government scholarship programs that are interested in "students like
[me]".  My persona has a terrible cumulative average and class rank:

<img src="http://replay.waybackmachine.org/web/20071212180905im_/http://colinfahey.com/oldpages/2003apr5_sat/www_collegeboard_com_sat_questionnaire01.jpg"/>

True Story: I received an award for "perfect attendance"
when I was in high school!

The questionnaire seems to go on forever.  Eventually I encountered questions
about my club participation, awards, etc, but the highlight was the list of
sports:

<img src="http://replay.waybackmachine.org/web/20071212180905im_/http://colinfahey.com/oldpages/2003apr5_sat/www_collegeboard_com_sat_questionnaire07.jpg"/>
FIGURE: I like sports that involve weapons and fighting.

I selected sports having some connection to medieval warfare!  Perhaps, a
century from now, they will have sports like: "U.N. Dodging", "Smart Bombing",
and "Nation Building".



Sometimes my attempts at exquisite contradiction were detected.

FIGURE: Sometimes my attempts at exquisite contradiction were detected.



After answering six pages of "sign-up" questions, and answering ten pages of
a "personal information" questionnaire, and filling out credit card information,
I finally had the magic ticket:

FIGURE: SAT I Admission Ticket (some parts highlighted and censored)

As you can see, I elected to send my score report to four significant
universities:

<table bgcolor="#ffffff" border="1" cellpadding="20"><tbody><tr><td><font color="#000000"><pre><p>
(1) <u>University of California, Irvine (UCI)</u>
    (Middle 50% of 17,723 Freshman SAT: V 520-610 M 550-670)
    Where I earned my M.S. in Physics;  Go, Anteaters!

(2) <u>University of Pennsylvania</u>
    (Middle 50% of  9,730 Freshman SAT: V 640-730 M 670-760)
    Where I earned my B.A. in Physics;  Go, Quakers!

(3) <u>Massachusetts Institute of Technology (M.I.T.)</u>
    (Middle 50% of  4,213 Freshman SAT: V 680-760 M 730-800)
    A school for late-night cleaning crew janitors who know combinatorics,
    and auto mechanics who love talk-radio;

(4) <u>Harvard University</u>
    (Middle 50% of  6,637 Freshman SAT: V 700-790 M 700-780)
    My "safety school" in case my scores aren't good enough to get admitted
    to my top school choices.  I heard that dropping out of Harvard in the
    first year is the path to total domination of the computer industry.
    It is time I started dominating instead of being oppressionated!
</p></pre></font></td></tr></tbody></table><br/>

Nothing says "success" more than getting admitted to your alma mater a
second time.  Don't do this if you have defaulted on all of your school loans
or if you are on the run from the authorities.

I printed the admission ticket.  It is required on test day.

<tt><pre>The beauty of my special test-taking system is that it requires significantly
less preparation than other test-taking systems.

Perhaps the best way to learn how to fail is to learn how to succeed.
The College Board offers a handy manual to the SAT I:

<a href="http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20071212180905/http://colinfahey.com/oldpages/2003apr5_sat/original_2003apr5_sat.htm#the_sat/www_college_board_taking_sat.pdf" target="_blank"><img src="http://replay.waybackmachine.org/web/20071212180905im_/http://colinfahey.com/oldpages/2003apr5_sat/www_collegeboard_com_manual_small.jpg"/></a>

However, I have discovered that failure favors the unprepared mind, and so I did
not read this manual before taking the test.

         (Pencil shavings are from the test.  Bidding starts at $600.)

A person taking the test requires a "#2 pencil" ("#2" refers to the hardness of
the graphite). A mechanical pencil, or a regular pencil and a sharpener, can be
used.  An eraser is handy not only for modifications, but also for removing the
inevitable graphite smudges that appear when part of the answer sheet is in
contact with the table.

I haven't used pencils in almost a decade, and I didn't have pencils or a
sharpener in my apartment, so I bought pencils and a sharpener at a local
24-hour Rite-Aid store two hours before the test.

The SAT materials include a single test booklet with all questions and an
answer sheet with a single fold to form a "four page" form.

<tt><pre><h1>MY TEST-TAKING EXPERIENCE</h1></pre></tt>
<tt><pre>This section describes some of my impressions of this test-taking experience.


<u>The Math Sections were Easy for Me</u>

I thought I solved all math problems correctly on paper (pages of test booklet).
(It turns out I may have made a mistake on one problem.  See conclusion.)

After solving each math problem, and noting that the solution corresponded to
an existing option, I selected the MOST ABSURD alternative answer.  Since this
test date did not offer a detailed question and answer reporting option, I 
cannot share this extra humorous touch with the public.

For the "student-produced" responses, which cannot subtract points from the
raw score, I simply wrote a sequence of numbers that encodes my name:
C O L I N P F --&gt; 3, 15, 12, 9, 14, 16, 6;  I think this will show up in
my "Student Answer Service" report.  (2003 May 26th: I received my "Student
Answer Service" report, and I learned that one of my "random" answers turned
out to be a correct answer!  Note to self: I'm an idiot!)

Sometimes, for particularly tricky math problems, I felt a little pang of
regret that my mission prevented me from proving that I actually knew the
correct answers.


<u>The Calculator was Handy</u>

For several math problems the calculator came in handy.  Sometimes it seemed 
easier to simply add up a bunch of numbers rather than work out a formula that
would yield the answer.


<u>The Verbal Sections were Difficult for Me</u>

The verbal division of the SAT is dominated by "Critical Reading" subsections.
Each Critical Reading subsection has several sets of Critical Reading questions.
Each set of questions begins with a passage having several paragraphs, followed
by questions that refer to the passage.  Many questions refer to specific lines
of the passage using line numbers.

The passages are extracted from existing literary sources, such as articles,
novels, scientific papers, short stories, and journals.  The passages are not
manufactured by the College Board researchers.  The topics of the passages
are very diverse; essentially random.  The College Board points out that the
opinions expressed in the passages do not reflect the opinions of the College
Board.

In principle, presenting a test-taker with various types of written material
(scientific, fictional, historical, journalistic, etc) seems like an ideal way
to gauge how the test-taker might perform in an environment that involves
exposure to the same degree of literary diversity.

My gripe with the "Critical Reading" questions is with the questions themselves.
It is my opinion that the questions, in general, involve subjective factors and
implicit assumptions that often make them impossible to answer in a rational
manner.

It is possible that people with the same subjective influences and implicit
assumptions do well in college, because college faculty belong to the same 
dominant species of irrationality.  So, the value of the verbal section
of the SAT as a predictor of performance in college might be quite high.
However, the side-effect of optimizing a test to better predict success in 
college is that truly objective minds might be punished for not keeping up
with the latest delusions.

The following questions are typical of the types of questions found in
the Critical Reading subsections:

</pre><table bgcolor="#ffffff" border="1" cellpadding="20"><tbody><tr><td><font color="#000000"><pre><p>
"Which of the following would be the most appropriate title
 for this passage?"

"The author of this passage would likely agree with which of
 the following statements:"

"Which of the following best describes the author's opinion
 about XXXX ?"

"According to the passage, the American Indian notion of
 time involves which of the following concepts:"

"The author of Passsage #1 would most likely have which of
 the following opinions regarding statements made by the
 author of Passage #2:"
</p></pre></font></td></tr></tbody></table><br/>

While trying to figure out the answers to Critical Reading questions
I am convinced that I fully understand the passages, the questions, and the
meanings of all multiple-choice options, and yet there are times when there
doesn't seem to be a basis for selecting an answer.

Maybe I should take the SAT on a date when the detailed "Question and Answer"
service is offered.  Then I could debate concrete examples with people and
decide if there really is a kind of verbal intelligence that helps people
answer these questions in a consistent and rational manner.  Or maybe I will
comprehend the principles of this variety of intelligence and decide that I
am better off without it!

Thankfully, my test-taking strategy involves choosing the wrong answers,
which made some of the trickier verbal questions much easier.  Sometimes the
best answer was hard to identify, but the absurd answers were very easy to
spot.

In 2005, multiple-choice questions will require students to identify sentence
errors, improve sentences, and improve paragraphs.  I'm glad my future doesn't
depend on someone's "improvement" aesthetic!  A 25-minute written essay section
will also be added to the SAT, which means that the arbitrary forces of 
subjectivity on the overall verbal score may be taken to an entirely new level.
It is very difficult for me to imagine grading criteria for these essays that
would transcend personal opinions about writing style.  I've heard of cases
in which a single essay earned radically different grades from different
college professors -- and sometimes radically different grades from the SAME
college professor, who unwittingly grades the same essay twice at different
times.


<u>Three Hours of Test-Taking is Exhausting</u>

The SAT requires sitting at a desk for exactly three hours of actual problem
solving, filling in up to approximately 165 bubbles with a #2 pencil.  When
one adds in the time spent writing down personal information, filling in other
bubbles, and listening to instructions, the whole experience lasts about 3.5
hours.  Something about the need to not screw up over a prolonged period like
this is really fatiguing.

I was grateful for my inspiration to bring a cold bottle of Pepsi and a bottle
of orange juice.  Still, near the end of the exam I wished I had a third drink,
and maybe a chocolate chip cookie!  [Make mental note, in case there's a 
"next time"! :-O]

To answer all math questions, you have an average of 75.0 seconds per question
to read, compute, and completely fill in the answer bubble.  For the verbal
sections the pace is a little bit faster, at 57.7 seconds per question.  This
seems generous, but to me it felt like I was racing the clock for all sections
of the test, finishing each section with very little time to spare.  So, the
pace of the test kept me feeling a little bit harassed.

As the test wore on, I became increasingly distracted by the thought of how
tedious it was to repeatedly locate bubbles and fill them in.


<u>I almost laughed out loud at various times during the test</u>

I definitely passed through some kind of mental barrier as a result of this
experience.  Up to this point, my relationship to exams was based on the strong
desire to get every question correct.  My educational career lasted 20 years.
Assuming an average of 8 distinct courses each year, and two major exams per
course, that's 320 exams!  When you add in the CTBS, NMSQT, PSAT, SAT (I), AT
(SAT II), AP, GRE, GRE subject test, departmental qualifier, etc, that's at 
least ten more major exams.  I have been conditioned to try very hard to 
determine correct answers.

So, in this latest experience, when I worked very hard to determine the correct
answer for each question, and then proceeded to pick the exact WRONG answer
(in fact, the most RIDICULOUS answer), I had a very strong emotional reaction.
For a while I worried that this new peculiar feeling of freedom was in fact
insanity;  I was finally making the transition to madness.

But after a few minutes of settling in to the routine of NOT filling in the
correct answers, and beginning to crave this new sense of accomplishment, I
started to think of how radically different my mental state was from that of
the high school students in the same room, taking the same test.  An earlier
show of hands indicated that most of the students were taking the SAT for the
first time.  So, I think it's very likely there were some people in the room
who were terrified.  For better or for worse they were confronting destiny.
Meanwhile, I was confronting silliness.  The difference in perspective seemed
so extreme that there were moments when I shook with desperately suppressed
laughter.  I did not laugh aloud or smile conspicuously, but the instinct to
laugh was as powerful and as involuntary as a case of hiccups.

I admire people who devote themselves to improvement, and I know very well how
stressful it can be to have success depend on a relatively short personal
demonstration, but humor draws its strength from fear, and the kind of anxiety
surrounding the SAT is so familiar, and yet so meaningless, that one can only
laugh or become depressed.

From the very beginning of the test to the very end I felt euphoric.  I was 
having complex emotions I couldn't describe.  This experience was far more
rewarding than I had imagined.

<tt><pre><h1>MY TEST SCORES</h1></pre></tt>
<tt><pre><h2><u>The Torture of Waiting for Scores</u></h2></pre></tt>
<tt><pre>I was surprised how bothered I was waiting for my score report, especially
considering the fact that I am not a high school student, and I am not facing
deadlines.  Still, I was checking my mailbox daily, and I even figured out when
the postal worker delivered mail (4 PM for me), and I checked at the earliest
possible time each day.  All day long I was distracted by the anticipation of
getting the score report.  I wrote an e-mail to the College Board and learned
that score reports were sent with first-class postage.  (I bet they get that
question all the time!)

But most people don't have to wait nearly as long to find out their scaled
scores.  About ten days after the test date, scores are available online for a
charge of $13.  On the first Monday three weeks after the test date, scores are 
mailed out to test-takers and any specified institutions via first-class mail
(usually 5 full business days to arrive at points in the US).  Starting on the
date the scores are mailed, the online scores for that test date can be
accessed without paying a fee.

FIGURE: Looking at my SAT scores online.

Unfortunately, the online report does not indicate the raw scores.  Still, it
is reassuring that my scaled scores and percentages are at the minimums.
(NOTE: Contrary to popular opinion, one is likely to have to get at least one
question wrong on the test to result in the lowest scaled scores possible.
Blank tests are interpreted as requests to cancel scores, but even if they were
given scaled scores, such scores would likely be significantly greater than the
minimum scaled scores of 200.)

<tt><pre>
Finally, on May 6th, eight days after the College Board claims score reports
are mailed out, I received the following:

<tt><pre><h2><u>Failing at Failure: Total Humiliation!</u></h2></pre></tt>
<tt><pre>Opening the envelope, eager with anticipation, I find the following report:

<img src="http://replay.waybackmachine.org/web/20071212180905im_/http://colinfahey.com/oldpages/2003apr5_sat/sat_report_wide04.jpg"/>
FIGURE: Printed score report.

The first part is reassuring:

FIGURE: Scaled scores and percentiles.

But, OH NO!  I actually answered two questions correctly on the test!!

FIGURE: Two questions correct, with no question omitted.

Ugh, I have failed to achieve total failure!  That is pathetic.  But somehow 
this seems like a fitting outcome -- and it is a wide-open invitation for
competition.

I can't believe I accidentally answered two MATH problems correctly!  I was
preparing myself for the disappointment of getting a few VERBAL questions
wrong, er, I mean correct, but MATH?!...How?  Sabotage! ;-)
</pre></tt>
<tt><pre><h2><u>"Student Answer Service" Report</u></h2></pre></tt>
<tt><pre>A few weeks later I received the "Student Answer Service" report, which told
me a little more about which questions I answered correctly by accident:

<img src="http://replay.waybackmachine.org/web/20071212180905im_/http://colinfahey.com/oldpages/2003apr5_sat/sat_student_answer_service01.jpg"/>
FIGURE: "Student Answer Service" report.

The two "+" signs indicate questions I answered correctly:

FIGURE: Two questions answered correctly ("+") in mathematics.

As you can see, one correct answer was in the "Student-Produced Responses"
section.  It's impossible to get negative raw score points for these questions,
so it would have been better to simply leave all 10 answers blank -- but 
instead I encoded my name (COLIN P F... --&gt; 3,15,12,9,14, 16, 6...), and it
appears that "9" was a correct answer!  As for the other geometric reasoning
question, I'm guessing I simply answered it correctly by accident.
</pre></tt>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<a name="conclusion"></a>
<tt><pre><h1>CONCLUSION</h1></pre></tt>
<tt><pre>
I am confident that I am one of the few people in the long history of the SAT
to answer <i>practically</i> every question incorrectly.  Getting a score of 1600 is
more of a challenge, but my goal was novelty!

</pre><table bgcolor="#ffffff" border="1" cellpadding="20"><tbody><tr><td><font color="#000000"><pre><p>
"It is better to have answered incorrectly
 than never to have answered at all!"
</p></pre></font></td></tr></tbody></table><br/>

In 1994, the introduction of the "student-response" math questions made it 
impossible to lose points on some questions, which represents a blow to the
goal of extremely wrong performance.

In 2005, the introduction of the written essay section, replacing a section of
multiple-choice questions, will deprive test-takers of the current negative
point potential.

This experiment grew on me as time passed by, and now I am thinking of other
funny angles, like asking Princeton Review or Kaplan if they would be interested
in being able to make the claim that a person who participated in their SAT
preparation course improved his test score by 1200 points!

I want it to be known that I think the SAT is a reasonable test.  I also
believe that the College Board web site and e-mail notifications are very good
resources for high school students on their way to college.  Some aspects of 
the SAT are bizarre, and perhaps competition in the standardized testing 
<i>business</i> would be good for consumers (students and institutions), but I
can't think of any particular improvements that would be big enough to justify
entering the market.

With the introduction of the essay section of the SAT in March, 2005, a new 
kind of grading is required.  Apparently essays will be graded by two humans.
However, essays on the GMAT are graded using computer algorithms to assure
uniform standards...But it opens up the possibility of cheating by simply
writing things that maximize the points awarded by the algorithm.  I can 
imagine writing total nonsense that has all the right properties to fool the
grader algorithm in to awarding a high score.  Now THAT would be a good hack!
Too bad it's just the GMAT.  Here's a link to the E-Rater system:

I searched College Board literature to find the policy regarding filling in two
or more ovals on the answer sheet for a single question.  I seem to remember 
that it would be considered an omitted question, but I can't find any published
evidence.  However, filling the "E" oval for a five-choice question <i>is</i>
counted as an omitted question (no points subtracted).

In any case, my objective was to answer all questions incorrectly by avoiding
the correct answers, not through a technicality.  I will not announce any other
low scores on this site unless I get a copy of the "Student Answer Service"
report or the "Question And Answer" report.

Does anyone have any evidence supporting or disproving the following claim?

Nope. IIRC, answers with more than one bubble are regarded<br/>
as blank. In the SAT's, blank answers are worth a fraction<br/>
of a point, so as to discourage random guessing. You'd score<br/>
abysmally, but not that abysmally. <br/>

The Relative Percentage is an integer between 1 and 99 <br/>
Which, as any math person knows, doesn't make any sense.<br/>
Intuitively, nobody is entitled to a 100 or 0, because nobody<br/>
gets a better score or worse score than everybody. But a little<br/>
thought about the definition of rounding tells you that it makes<br/>
perfect sense to give a 100 to the top 0.5% of test takers.<br/>

The most fun fact about "SAT eins" and Germany is that a private <br/>

probably a reverence to the satellite "Sat 1" which covers most of <br/>

Found out about your website from the blog, What The Heck?!<br/>
(www.whattheheck.com).  I'm just a tad disappointed you beat me to the<br/>
same idea.<br/>
<br/>
Couple things I thought I'd point out.  For those two "wrong" answers you<br/>
have in the Geometric Reasoning, let's not forget that standardized tests<br/>
often find out they make mistakes and place multiple correct answers, or<br/>
accidentally program the computer to accept a wrong answer instead of the<br/>
correct one.  Something like that may have happened here, and everyone got<br/>
a bonus question or two.  You may have utterly failed after all.<br/>
<br/>
What's really interesting, I think, is that in the breakdown of each type<br/>
of question, you are listed in being in the fifth percentile of all<br/>
students in each category, despite nearly pulling off the anti-perfect<br/>
test.  Maybe I'm being a tad too incredulous here, but does this mean that<br/>
about one in every 20 people taking the SAT are screwing up every question<br/>
in a given section?  I'd love to see what scores rank in what percentiles.<br/>
<br/>
Also, don't trust any postmark run on red ink - those are personal postal<br/>
meters, and you honestly can alter those to say whatever date you want. <br/>
Government agencies actually cannot accept one of those as a postmark date<br/>
(I know, for I work in one).  Of course, the College Board is not a<br/>
government agency, but still, you see my point - they are not reliable.<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, thanks for the illuminating and hilarious take on the SAT.<br/>

I was also surprised that your calculator always rounds up.<br/>
I tried both the US-manufactured calculators I own and they do the same.<br/>
Although, perhaps the fix function is different from rounding. There was no<br/>
'round' function on my calculators; only 'fix'.<br/>
<br/>
I checked various programming languages (C, perl, python) and they all round<br/>
to nearest even integer. So, hrm. Maybe it's just different in the U.S.<br/>
After all, you guys still use the imperial measuring system! =D<br/>

Hi, loved the whole concept... One of those things that you think<br/>
of - and find brilliant in theory, but think, "Naw, too silly to<br/>
actually do."<br/>
<br/>
Thank God someone has the guts to chase the nightmare.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, my point in writing: Your postmark problem. That isn't<br/>
a "postmark".  Note under the eagle, it says meter and is followed<br/>
by a serial number.  That is the imprint of a Pitney Bowes postage<br/>
meter, and April 24 would be the date (probably, see * below) that<br/>
the postage was applied to that particular envelope. In all<br/>
likelihood, some poor schmuck (or a small team of poor schmucks)<br/>
working in a mailroom had to apply these marks to _hundreds of<br/>
thousands_ of these envelopes, depending of course on how many<br/>
locations process the mailing of scores. Clearly, they would want<br/>
to get a head start on prepping envelopes. And can you blame them?<br/>
<br/>
* You can set PB postage meters _ahead_ to any date, but you can't<br/>
backdate them.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps. Keep up the brilliance. Or, I guess, the<br/>
lack thereof.<br/>

Oh, and a clarification (and some more useless information): Pitney<br/>
Bowes postage meters can, in theory, be backdated, but you would<br/>
need either a) a series of codes available only to certain PB<br/>
technicians and administrators, or b) to break open the dater, run<br/>
it backwards manually, reassemble it, and hope that it still<br/>
functions. To do so, as you can guess, would violate several civil<br/>

<br/>
Dear (X) Sir, ( ) Madam, ( ) Possum,<br/>
<br/>
It has come to Our ears that your individual person transported<br/>
itself, on the day 52 of the Season of Discord, anno 3169, to the<br/>
Rowland Hall, University of California, Irvine, in order to take<br/>
the test known as SAT 1 with the intention of answering incorrectly<br/>
to all the questions.<br/>
<br/>
Though We could not understand why you did not question the answers<br/>
instead of the opposite, We believe you did achieve a notable<br/>
performance in the Way of Confusion. Moreover your personal<br/>
testimony of the experience suggests that your soul was touched by<br/>
our Lady of Discord, as is apparent in this excerpt :<br/>
-------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
I definitely passed through some kind of mental barrier as a result<br/>
of this experience. [...] So, in this latest experience, when<br/>
worked very hard to determine the correct answer for each question,<br/>
and then proceeded to pick the exact WRONG answer (in fact, the<br/>
most RIDICULOUS answer), I had a very strong emotional reaction.<br/>
For a while I worried that this new peculiar feeling of freedom was<br/>
in fact insanity;  I was finally making the transition to madness.<br/>
<br/>
But after a few minutes of settling in to the routine of NOT<br/>
filling in the correct answers, and beginning to crave this new<br/>
sense of accomplishment, I started to think of how radically<br/>
different my mental state was from that of the high school students<br/>
in the same room, taking the same test. [...] Meanwhile, I was<br/>
confronting silliness.  The difference in perspective seemed so<br/>
extreme that there were moments when I shook with desperately<br/>
suppressed laughter.  I did not laugh aloud or smile conspicuously,<br/>
but the instinct to laugh was as powerful and as involuntary as a<br/>
case of hiccups.<br/>
-------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
We believe you were personnally contacted by Our Lady Eris through<br/>
your pineal gland at this very moment.<br/>
<br/>
Therefore, by Our Official Capacity of Great Pasha, Episcopate of<br/>
the Discordian Society, for your Act of Faith in Holy Confusion and<br/>
Subsequent Enlightenment, We appoint you as:<br/>
<br/>
     Erisian Avatar or Assimilated,<br/>
     House of Apostle of Eris for the Eristocracy and Cabalability<br/>
<br/>
Arise !<br/>
<br/>
Receive Our Most Complascent and Psychotic Congratulations.<br/>

            In the name of His High Reverence Malaclypse the Younger<br/>

<tt><pre><b><u>HAS THIS BEEN DONE BEFORE?</u></b>
After more than 128,000 visitors to this web page I have received only two
e-mail messages claiming that "friends" attempted the stunt described in this
article before my own attempt in April, 2003.

     <u>CLAIM #1</u>: "A high school student took the SAT in the 1960s, 
     got all questions wrong, then took the SAT again and answered all
     questions correctly and was admitted to Berkeley."

     <u>CLAIM #2</u>: "A high school student took the SAT in 1989,
     getting all questions wrong.  This student was admitted to Harvard."

I have made efforts to get in direct contact with the "friends" to eventually
get proof of their accomplishments, but I have not received any responses.
I have changed some of the comments in this article to leave room for the 
possibility of other people having done the same stunt before me, and I 
would actually be a little surprised to learn that I was in fact the first to
get such an extreme negative raw score, but so far I have not received any
direct claims from people, or any supporting evidence.

<b><u>I WILL GLADLY REPORT SIMILAR ACCOMPLISHMENTS</u></b>
I will gladly report any past or future accomplishments similar to my own.
However, I will ask for various forms of evidence before I make any reports on
this page.  If you plan to register for the SAT to attempt this stunt, be sure
to order the optional "Student Answer Service" if it is available for the 
particular test date.

<b><u>PROOF THAT GETTING A TERRIBLE SAT SCORE DOESN'T RUIN ONE'S LIFE</u></b>
Several months after getting almost the worst possible raw score on the SAT,
I was invited to pursue a Ph.D. in Computer Science at UCI.  Ironically, I had
to take the GRE General Test again (since my 1992 scores are too old), and I
scored a 1410 on the computer adaptive test version with only a week of casual
preparation.  Am I a hyprocrite?  Wasn't the thesis of this SAT article 
something like "sticking it to 'The Man'"?!  I'm too stupid to know, but in a
few years I might be <i>Dr.</i> Hypocrite, and perhaps even <i>Professor</i> Hypocrite.
All praise The System and its mysterious ways!
