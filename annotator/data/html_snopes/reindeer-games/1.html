</p><p>WHAT IS A REINDEER
<br/>Reindeer (Rangifer tarandus) are semi-domesticated caribou. Although
similar, there are fundamental differences between reindeer and their wild
cousins, caribou. Reindeer are shorter and stouter. Reindeer bulls are
smaller than caribou bulls, but cows may weigh the same as caribou cows.
Coloration differences may be too subtle to notice between many reindeer
and caribou, however, reindeer tend to be lighter with occasional pinto
or white haircoats. The nose bridge, or face, of reindeer are flatter than
caribou. Reindeer tend to stay in more cohesive groups. When herded or
chased they tend to run in a tight group, whereas, caribou are often scattered.
These traits are the result of domestication. It is believed they have
been domesticated in Eurasia for at least 7,000 years, which is longer
than the horse (Edwards, 1994). In Eurasia reindeer are classified as either
domesticated or wild. Only in North America are “wild reindeer” called
caribou.

</p><p>LIFE HISTORY
<br/>Female reindeer typically reach reproductive maturity as yearlings
and may stay productive up until 15 years of age. Some female calves on
the Seward Peninsula conceive at five months of age and calve as yearlings.
Bulls usually don’t breed until they’re three years old. Their life expectancy
is about eight years, usually ending as a result of their final breeding
attempt. Breeding takes place in August and September with calving peaking
around April 24th. This is a one month difference for breeding and calving
between reindeer and caribou (and Scandinavian reindeer) <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20050415075722/http://www.state.ak.us/local/akpages/FISH.GAME/notebook/biggame/caribou.htm">Alaska
Department of Fish and Game's Wildlife Notebook Series</a>). However, reindeer
and caribou can interbreed. Most likely, breeding would be between a male
caribou and female reindeer, because caribou are usually dominant.
</p><p>ANTLERS
<br/>Reindeer and caribou are the only deer (Cervidae) where males, females,
and calves produce antlers. Substantial growth of calf and female antler
can be obtained with good nutrition. Some females can grow small shovels
(eye-guards), normally grown only by bulls. Like other deer, reindeer shed
their antlers annually. Bulls drop their antlers by January, and pregnant
cows and calves retain theirs until spring. Normally, pregnant cows retain
their antlers a week or so after calving for advantage over food resources. 
New antler growth in the spring and summer is nourished by a highly vascular
covering called velvet which is shed in August. Bull antler hardens (ossifies)
in June and cow antler in July. The primary function of antler is for gaining
social dominance. There is a demand in Asia (China, Korea) for antler just
before it ossifies into hard bone. It is processed in different ways for
use as health aids.
</p><p><font color="#660000"><font size="+1">Adaptations For Life in the Arctic</font></font>
</p><p><b>Pelage</b>
<br/>Reindeer hair is extremely dense. The outer coat of long, hollow guard
hairs are at a density of 5,000/ sq.in.. A fine “wooly” hair at 13,000/
sq.in. as an undercoat makes for an efficient air trap. This thick coat
inhibits radiation and allows them to lay on snow without melting it and
getting wet. Facial hair extends down to their lips protecting the muzzle
when grazing in snow. Reindeer don’t get frost build-up from their breath.
Bone and cartilage in their nostrils are designed like a “rolled-scroll.”
This increases the surface area inside so that blood can warm the cool
incoming air. Heat is retained and moisture condensed and retained from
expired air. The hollow guard hair provides bouyancy facilitating their
swimming ability. Their multi-colored coat allows for concealment, an advantage
for free-ranging reindeer. However, adaptations such as preventing radiation
and lack of sweat glands for heat conservation in winter may cause stress
in warm weather. In summer they shed their guard hair exposing their dark,
soft undercoat.
</p><p><b>Feet</b>
<br/>Reindeer hoofs are large relative to their body. This load factor and
wide splaying of their hoofs, acting like snowshoes, helps them to walk
on snow. The hoofs are concave and do not have pads. The edges may act
as blades and hair extending under the hoofs help when walking on ice.
The shovel-like design also helps with swimming and digging for forage
(cratering). Their hoofs and gait enable them to travel across tundra efficiently.
They have a relatively high-stepping gait combined with a trot like a cross
between a horse and camel. Because they are not as long-legged as caribou,
it is thought that when reindeer mingle with caribou they have a higher
predation rate because they may be slower than caribou.
</p><p><b>Feeding</b>
<br/>Reindeer, like all Cervids and Bovids, are ruminants. They are classified
as a “concentrate selector” to intermediate forager which means they select
higher quality forage, whereas, cattle and bison are considered generalist
grazers because they eat large amounts of lower quality forage (Hofmann
1988). For instance, when given longstem hay, reindeer will eat only the
more palatable leafy parts. Free-ranging reindeer search for emerging buds,
leaves and flowers of sedges and dig for rhizomes in the spring, followed
by willow leaves, forbs, and mushrooms as they emerge in early summer.
Reindeer physiology is specialized to eat and digest lichen (sometimes
called reindeer moss) as an energy source in winter. Lichen is produced
by a symbiotic relationship between algae and fungi.<font size="-1"><a href="/web/20050415075722/http://reindeer.salrm.uaf.edu/documents/Reindietgraph.doc">(Click
to see free-ranging Reindeer diet graph)</a></font>
</p><p>Captive reindeer must be fed a balanced diet of commercial grains, forage
and supplements. A special adaptation of northern ungulates is the seasonality
in their appetite, metabolism and growth rates. Reindeer decrease their
food intake and lose weight in the winter and increase their appetite and
growth in spring and summer. This cycle is maintained not only for free-ranging
reindeer, but also when offered ad-lib feed (shown in graph below). Also,
they decrease their activity in winter to conserve reserves. Reindeer prefer
snow over water in winter. The lack of minerals in snow and small amount
in lichen minimize the requirement for water. Also, there is a lower loss
of body heat to melt snow than to search for and warm copious amounts of
water.
</p><p>Winter conditions may still exist when calves are born. Reindeer milk
is extremely high in protein and fat. Many organs of reindeer are relatively
larger than many domestic animals for increased growth rate. These two
factors facilitate survival, especially for free-ranging reindeer. Adults,
particularly cows, are nutritionaly stressed during springtime. They are
known to eat rodents, eggs, placenta and chew on antler to attain limited
nutrients.

<br/>(Barley = 81.6; ADM-blue label vitamin/ mineral mix = 7.65; plain salt

</p><p>Note: due to digestive dynamics with concentrate diets this ration should
be offered slowly over a period of two weeks or more. Contact us for other
diets and information.
</p><p>We supplement the diet with long-stem hay about every five days. This
semi-fresh forage is something for our reindeer to nibble on to break the
monotony of their concentrate ration, especially in winter. It may also
help maintain a healthy population of microbes that produce enzymes to
digest grasses. Remember, the leafy parts only are palatable to reindeer,
and hay alone is not sufficient nutrition for reindeer.

<b><u><font color="#990000"><font size="+1"> Antlers </font></font></u></b>
</p><p>
Both male and female reindeer grow antlers. Although adult males grow the largest racks, adult females can have some very  impressive antlers making it difficult or impossible to distinguish the sex based on antlers alone.  Bulls generally shed their antlers in winter between December and January. Castrated males(steers) and non-pregnant females will shed their antlers between February and April. Pregnant females will retain their antlers until after they have their calves in late April and May. </p><p>
