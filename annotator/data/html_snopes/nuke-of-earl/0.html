<p>In mid-to-late 1999, e-mails such as the following were flying
around the Internet….</p>

<p><font color="#0033FF"><i>AND THE 1999 DARWIN AWARD WINNER
IS.....</i></font></p>
<p><font color="#0033FF"><i>THOMPSON, MANITOBA, CANADA. Telephone
relay company night watchman Edward Baker, 31, was killed early
Christmas morning by excessive microwave radiation exposure. He was
apparently attempting to keep warm next to a telecommunications
feed-horn. Baker had been suspended on a safety violation once last
year, according to Northern Manitoba Signal Relay spokesperson Tanya
Cooke. She noted that Baker's earlier infraction was for defeating a
safety shutoff switch and entering a restricted maintenance catwalk
in order to stand in front of the microwave dish. He had told
coworkers that it was the only way he could stay warm during his
twelve-hour shift at the station, where winter temperatures often dip
to forty below zero. Microwaves can heat water molecules within human
tissue in the same way that they heat food in microwave ovens. For
his Christmas shift, Baker reportedly brought a twelve pack of beer
and a plastic lawn chair, which he positioned directly in line with
the strongest microwave beam. Baker had not been told about a tenfold
boost in microwave power planned that night to handle the anticipated
increase in holiday long-distance calling traffic. Baker's body was
discovered by the daytime watchman, John Burns, who was greeted by an
odor he mistook for a Christmas roast he thought Baker must have
prepared as a surprise. Burns also reported to NMSR company officials
that Baker's unfinished beers had exploded. </i></font></p>

<p>Now, for the REST of the Story!!</p>
<p><font size="+1"><b><i>NMSR Reports, Vol. 5, No. 9, September
1999</i></b></font></p>
<p> The August 9th edition of the Denver Post carried an article
with the following headline: "DARWIN AWARDS PAY HOMAGE TO THE MONKEY
IN MAN." Columnist Dick Kreck discussed the Darwin Awards, awarded
(posthumously) to those whose acts have led to the removal of their
genes from the pool.</p>
<p>Kreck wrote:</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><i>"It's the moment we wait for every year,
and I'm always glad my name isn't on the list.</i></font></p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><i>"The annual DARWIN AWARDS are out. They
are given (although I've never been clear who, exactly, hands them
out) "to those individuals who did the most for the human gene pool
by removing themselves from it." </i></font></p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><i>"Being a cynic, I'm convinced some of
these tales of self-removal are little more than urban legends, but
who cares? They make astonishing reading, and they always raise the
question, "What were they thinking?" </i></font></p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><i>"The "winner" in this year's poll is from
Canada. It seems Edward Baker, 32, a telephone relay company night
watchman, was killed early Christmas morning by excessive microwave
radiation exposure. Baker, the story goes, warmed himself on cold
Manitoba nights by setting up a plastic lawn chair, and a six-pack,
in line with the microwave's strongest beam. </i></font></p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><i>"Guess what happened next? Baker wasn't
told that the company was boosting microwave power to handle heavy
holiday phone loads. To make a long story short, microwaves have the
same effect on a human body that ovens have on a roast. Say no
more."</i></font></p>

<p>Our story jogs to this e-mail, sent two days later by Mark
Boslough:</p>

<p>Subject: My Darwin Award Hoax</p>
<p> </p>
<p><font color="#0033FF">Dear Mr. Kreck:</font></p>
<p><font color="#0033FF"> </font></p>
<p><font color="#0033FF">Thank you so much for reprinting my Darwin
Award hoax in the Denver Post. Like you, I am a skeptic and have
always very suspicious of these stories. However, I am also a
scientist so I decided to do a little experiment. I made up the most
outrageous and twisted death-by-stupidity tale I could imagine. I
made sure that all the characters in the story had names (Mr. Baker,
Mr. Burns, Ms. Cooke) that would give my joke away to any wary
reader. I set the story in a location that allowed the company
"Northern Manitoba Signal Relay" to have the same acronym as New
Mexicans for Science and Reason, our local version of Boulder-based
Rocky Mountain Skeptics. I took a list of Darwin Awards that somebody
sent me and attached my own creation, which I also declared to be
this year's winner. I turned it loose by e-mailing it to a few
out-of-state friends on New Year's Day. Seeing it this week in the
Post is a bit like getting a response to a note in a bottle eight
months after throwing it into the ocean. It is also a good lesson in
why we should all be skeptical of what we see on the internet... not
to mention what we read in the newspaper!</font></p>
<p><font color="#0033FF">By the way, NMSR president Dave Thomas--a
recent guest speaker at Rocky Mountain Skeptics--is the only person
who discovered the hoax and correctly attributed it to me. He had
searched for "NMSR" under Deja News and recognized my brand of humor
when his search turned up my story.</font></p>
<p><font color="#0033FF">Best regards,</font></p>
<p><font color="#0033FF">Mark Boslough</font></p>

<p>Finally, this closure from columnist Kreck, who wrote an August
16th Post column entitled "Burned. Toast ":</p>
<p> </p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><i>"Is my face red? More than usual, I
mean."</i></font></p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><i>"Last week, I did the very thing I'm
always warning anyone who will listen: Don't believe everything you
see on the internet."</i></font></p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><i>"The "winner" of the annual Darwin Awards
made a loser out of me."</i></font></p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><i>"While the Darwins, given annually to
persons who manage to eliminate themselves from the planet through
some bizarre event, are genuine, it turns out the non-existent winner
was the work of a gentleman named Mark Boslough, who lives in
Albuquerque, N.M."</i></font></p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><i>"If I weren't so simple, he said (in a
nice way) in a follow-up letter, I would have seen through his hoax.
"Like you, I am a skeptic and have always been very suspicious of
these stories."</i></font></p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><i>"However, I am also a scientist so I
decided to do a little experiment. I made up the most outrageous and
twisted death-by-stupidity tale I could imagine. I made sure that all
the characters in the story had names (Mr. Baker, Mr. Burns,
Ms.Cooke) that would give my joke away to any wary reader." Except,
possibly, gullible columnists."</i></font></p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><i>"It is a good lesson in why we should all
be skeptical of what we see on the Internet, not to mention what we
read in the newspaper."</i></font></p>
<p><font color="#FF0000"><i>"So I guess this means the so-called
winner didn't really get roasted sitting in front of a microwave
dish?"</i></font></p>
<p>Kudos to Mark for another joke well done.</p>
<p>And kudos for a great "sig" (e-mail signature) too!</p>
