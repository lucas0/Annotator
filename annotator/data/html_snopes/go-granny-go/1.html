              Grandma Beats Up Airport Security Guards</font></b></font></h1>
<p align="center"><font face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">by 
              <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20020805125627/mailto:bob.wallace@att.net">Bob Wallace</a></font></b></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Charges 
              were dropped yesterday against Ruth "Grammy" Gordon, an 
              83-year-old wheelchair-bound grandmother, who was originally charged 
              with assault and battery, and assault with a deadly weapon, because 
              an altercation she had last week with six airport security guards, 
              that left all six hospitalized.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">"Justice 
              has been served," said the 95-pound mother of three and grandmother 
              of six, as she sat in her wheelchair, aided in her breathing by 
              an oxygen bottle. "Now I’m going to sue every fool in the federal 
              government for ignorance, stupidity, and just plain general incompetence. 
              I’m an American, and I won’t be treated like this."</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The 
              problem began last month as Gordon was attempting to board an airplane 
              at the R.J. Squirrel Airport in Frostbite Falls, Minnesota. "These 
              guys are supposed to be some kind of professionals," she said, 
              "but they’re dumber than rocks. Here they were letting guys 
              who looked just like terrorists walk through without searching them, 
              and then they pull me aside and tell me they’re going to search 
              me? I don’t think so."</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">According 
              to one witness, Bud Cort of Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio, one guard, "who 
              weighed about 300 pounds, looked like he was drunk, and had his 
              shirt out, told this woman she couldn’t board the plane unless they 
              searched her. He was really rude. That’s when the trouble started."</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Videotapes 
              showed that Gordon ran the guard down with her motorized wheelchair, 
              then sat on top of the screaming man while spinning her chair in 
              circles. "Doofus was so fat he couldn’t get up," said 
              Gordon with a giggle.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">One 
              guard who attempted to pull Gordon’s wheelchair off of the screaming 
              man from behind was hit over the head with an oxygen bottle and 
              knocked unconscious. A third guard, who approached Gordon from the 
              front, was also left dazed on the floor. Witnesses said she was 
              cackling, "Put your hands on an old lady, will you?" as 
              she bashed both guards.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The 
              tape also showed a fourth guard attempting to grab Gordon’s wheelchair. 
              Gordon removed a knitting needle from her purse and stabbed him 
              in his left buttock. "What a wimp," she told reporters. 
              "He started screaming and grabbing his butt and running like 
              a puppy that someone kicked."</font></p>
<p align="left">"It was amazing," said another witness, Scott Ryan, 
              also of Cuyahoga Falls, a professor of music at Ohio Express University 
              and author of <i>Yusef Islam: Cat Stevens Declawed</i>. "The whole 
              crowd just stood there cheering and clapping. I mean, she was whupping 
              butt." </p>
<p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">A 
              fifth guard that attempted to grab Gordon had the seat of his pants 
              set on fire with a cigarette lighter than had escaped detection. 
              "He just went whoosh across the concourse, screaming and slapping 
              at all these flames flying out of his rear," said Ryan.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">A 
              sixth guard did finally manage to get Gordon in a body hug. "I 
              think that was the wrong thing to do," said another witness, 
              who declined to be identified. "She just grabbed him by his 
              greasy hair with one hand and cracked him across the jaw with her 
              skinny fist. And down and out he went."</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">After 
              all this, Gordon’s chair was still sitting on top of the first guard. 
              The tapes clearly showed her leaning over and yelling, "Apologize 
              to me, you fat sumbitch, or when I’m done with you you’ll just be 
              a greasy spot on the floor!"</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">As 
              the crowd roared, the guard cried, "I’m sorry, I’m sorry! Uncle! 
              I won’t do it again!"</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Finally, 
              Gordon surrendered without further incident, and was taken to jail 
              and released on her own recognizance. "We didn’t have any choice," 
              said an unidentified officer of the court. "Over 200 people 
              showed up to support her. I think if we had demanded bail, there 
              would have been a riot."</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">Over 
              20 lawyers offered to defend her for free. However, realizing the 
              precariousness of the case, Gordon was not charged with anything. 
              "I doubt there’s a jury in the whole country that would have 
              found her guilty of anything," said one of the lawyers.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">"I’m 
              flying again tomorrow," Gordon told reporters. "And I 
              suggest no one at the airport so much as look at me wrong."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">All six guards, 
              employees of the Bullwinkle Security Company, were taken to Badanov 
              Hospital, treated for minor injuries, and released. "All of them 
              are okay," said their doctor, who identified herself only as Natasha. 
              "Just very minor injuries."</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">The owner of 
              the security firm, a Mr. Big, said he considered his employees to 
              be "fearless leaders.</font></p>
