And if President Trump turns out to be a danger to national security then it will be up to those around him to make the decision of whether to strip him of the powers of his office. But if Trump can be elected by the American people and simply discarded once he's no longer useful to the political machine, then maybe the folks who elected him to demolish the establishment are onto something after all. </p></div></div><div class="gU"><div class="gV"><div class="al"><img class="an" src="https://cdn.bustle.com/romper/production/public/lego_green-4be013.svg"/><img class="an ap" src="https://cdn.bustle.com/romper/production/public/lego_tan-1dbd43.svg"/><img class="an aq" src="https://cdn.bustle.com/romper/production/public/lego_green-4be013.svg"/><img class="an ar" src="https://cdn.bustle.com/romper/production/public/lego_tan-1dbd43.svg"/></div></div></div><script async="true" class="teads" src="//a.teads.tv/page/82139/tag" type="text/javascript"></script></article><div class="bV"></div></div><div class="as"><input class="av" id="navCheckbox" type="checkbox"/><label class="at" for="navCheckbox"></label><nav class="au"><label class="aA" for="navCheckbox"><button aria-label="close" class="aB"></button></label><ul class="aw"><li class="ax"><a href="/pregnancy">Pregnancy</a></li><li class="ax"><a href="/motherhood">Motherhood</a></li><li class="ax"><a href="/baby">Baby</a></li><li class="ax"><a href="/toddler">Toddler</a></li><li class="ax"><a href="/kid">Kid</a></li><li class="ax"><a href="/food">Food</a></li><li class="ax"><a href="/news">News</a></li><li class="ax"><a href="/entertainment">Entertainment</a></li><li class="ax"><a href="/sex-relationships">Sex &amp; Relationships</a></li><li class="ax"><a href="/fashion-beauty">Fashion &amp; Beauty</a></li><li><div class="ay"></div></li><li><a href="https://bustle.company/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">About Us</a></li><li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li><li><a href="/newsletter">Newsletter</a></li><li><a href="/terms">Terms</a></li><li><a href="/privacy">Privacy</a></li><li><div class="az"><a class="hn" href="https://www.facebook.com/Romperdotcom/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><i class="ho"></i></a><a class="hn" href="https://twitter.com/romper" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><i class="hu"></i></a><a class="hn" href="https://www.pinterest.com/romperdotcom/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><i class="hs"></i></a><a class="hn" href="https://instagram.com/romper/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><i class="hq"></i></a></div></li><li><div class="aC"></div></li></ul></nav></div><div class="b_ ca"><div class="cb"><div class="cc">Our website uses cookies to give you an easy and personalised experience and to support our marketing campaigns, including delivering our ads to you during your online experience on other sites.
