<center><h2>The Second Coming Project</h2></center>

The Second Coming Project is a not-for-profit organization devoted to bringing about the Second Coming of Our Lord, Jesus Christ, as prophesied in the Bible, in time for the 2,000th anniversary of his birth. Our intention is to clone Jesus, utilizing techniques pioneered at the Roslin Institute in Scotland, by taking an incorrupt cell from one of the many Holy Relics of Jesus' blood and body that are preserved in churches throughout the world, extracting its DNA, and inserting into an unfertilized human egg (oocyte), though the now-proven biological process called nuclear transfer. The fertilized egg, now the zygote of Jesus Christ, will be implanted into the womb of a young virginal woman (who has volunteered of her own accord), who will then bring the baby Jesus to term in a second Virgin Birth. 
<br/><br/>
If all goes according to plan, the birth will take place on December 25, 2000, thus making Anno Domini 2000 into Anno Domini Novi 1, and all calendrical calculations will begin anew.
<br/><br/>
<b><u>How Can This Be Possible?</u></b><br/>
<b>a.</b> Modern cloning technology enables us to clone any large mammal - including humans - using just a single cell from an adult specimen.<br/>
<b>b.</b> Throughout the Christian world are churches that contains Holy Relics of Jesus's body: his blood, his hair, his foreskin. Unless every single one of these relics is a fake, this means that cells from Jesus' body still survive to this day.
<br/><b>c.</b> We are already making preparations to obtain a portion of one of these relics, extract the DNA from one of its cells, and use it to clone Jesus.
<br/><br/>
No longer can we rely on hope and prayer, waiting around futilely for Jesus to return. We have the technology to bring him back right now: there is no reason, moral, legal or Biblical, not to take advantage of it. 
<br/><br/>
IN ORDER TO SAVE THE WORLD FROM SIN, WE MUST CLONE JESUS TO INITIATE THE SECOND COMING OF THE CHRIST.
<br/><br/>
The Second Coming Project is soliciting contributions and donations to help us is our quest. Time is short! We must have a fertilized Jesus zygote no later than April of 2000 if Baby Jesus is to come to term on the predicted date. Please send all contributions to:
