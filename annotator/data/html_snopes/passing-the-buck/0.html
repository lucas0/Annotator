<h2 align="center">Biography of Conrad Weiser*</h2>
<h3 align="center"> </h3>
<hr/>
<p><font size="+1">Perhaps the most fitting accolade bestowed on Conrad Weiser
was by an Iroquois, who, speaking to white men upon the death of Weiser in 1760,
lamented, "We are at a great loss and sit in darkness...as since his death
we cannot so well understand one another."</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Who was this man who had such far-reaching influence on
relations between Pennsylvania and the Iroquois Confederacy; who had access to
provincial governors and sachems alike; who interpreted and negotiated treaties;
who was commissioned an officer during the War for Empire; but who also sat as a
country judge, served as lay minister, and prospered as a farmer, tanner, and
storekeeper?</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Conrad Weiser was born November 2, 1696, in the German
principality of Wurttemberg. By 1709, his father, Johann Conrad Weiser, had
decided to heed Queen Anne's invitation to inhabitants of the Rhine Valley to
migrate to England and to the British colonies in America.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">The Weiser family settled on the New York frontier and in the
winter and spring of 1712-1713, young Conrad resided with neighboring Mohawks to
learn the language of the Iroquois and serve as a go-between for the German
community.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">During his years in New York, Weiser acquired a keen
knowledge of the language, customs and statesmanship of the Iroquois Confederacy
(or Six Nations), consisting of the Mohawks, Oneidas, Onondagas, Cayugas,
Senecas and Tuscaroras.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">By 1723, Germans from the Mohawk Valley had begun the
overland trek 400 miles, following the Susquehanna river to settle the
Tulpehocken Valley in what is now Berks and Lebanon Counties, Pennsylvania. In
1729, Weiser brought his German-born wife, Anna Eve, and their children to the
Tulpehocken region, settling on 200 acres near the present town of Womelsdorf.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Over the next 31 years Weiser became a major land-holder,
farmer, tanner and businessman. He and Anna Eve raised 14 children (seven of
whom lived to adulthood).</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">By the early 1730's, Weiser had become known in government
circles in Philadelphia for his knowledge of the Iroquois. Provincial Secretary
James Logan hired him to guide the new Pennsylvania Indian policy recognizing
Iroquois dominance over the indigenous Lenni Lenape and guaranteeing a stable
and safe frontier.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Over the next two decades Weiser was constantly directing and
implementing this policy through treaty negotiations, land purchases, and
journeys to the Iroquois homeland. He worked closely with Shikellamy, who had
been appointed by the Confederacy to embody Iroquois authority over the Lenni
Lenape.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">It was through Weiser and Shikellamy that the Pennsylvania
frontier remained stable and peaceful until mid-century.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">By 1755, however, growing competition between Britain and
France had ignited a full-blown "War for Empire." Diplomacy was put
aside as the Six Nations divided over which side to join.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Meanwhile, the French established an alliance with the Lenni
Lenape and other Native American peoples and launched raids against the eastern
Pennsylvania settlements along the Blue Mountain line.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Pennsylvania responded by forming provincial militia and
building a line of outposts. In 1756, Weiser received a commission of Lieutenant
Colonel with command of the 1st Battalion, Pennsylvania Regimen responsible for
manning the line between the Delaware and Susquehanna Rivers. He held this post
until 1758. In that same year an expedition to western Pennsylvania by General
John Forbes resulted in the eviction of the French and an end to the fighting in
eastern Pennsylvania.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Throughout his life, Weiser was active in local affairs. He
served as a magistrate for Lancaster County, helped found and lay out the town
of Reading in 1748, helped to establish Berks County in 1752, and was its
President Judge until his death.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Though a Lutheran, Weiser joined the monastic community of
Ephrata Cloister between 1735 and 1741. He lived intermittently as a celibate
brother, withdrawing from family and political life until becoming disenchanted
with the Cloister's leader Conrad Beissel.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Weiser, returning to the Lutheran Church, in which he had
served as a lay minister, became a founder of Trinity Church in Reading. His
daughter Maria married Henry Melchoir Muhlenberg, "patriarch" of the
Lutheran Church in Pennsylvania.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">At this death on July 13, 1760, Weiser owned several thousand
acres, in addition to his farm, tannery and the store in Reading.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Movements to honor Weiser's considerable accomplishments
culminated in the establishment of the Conrad Weiser Memorial Park by the Conrad
Weiser Memorial Park Association in 1928. The nationally known Olmsted Brothers
landscape firm designed the park.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Owned now by the Commonwealth, the Conrad Weiser Homestead is
administered by the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission, which
preserves the restored Weiser structures, graveyard and landscaped park, in
addition to interpreting Weiser's life.</font></p>
