Born to Fail analyzes the institutional roots of the Department of Homeland Security and the problem of balancing anti-terrorism, civil liberties, and civilian defense in the post-September 11, 2001 period. This project examines two primary issues: war and state-building as it relates to the post-9/11 period. Given that the DHS hopes to selectively institutionalize some programs that are used in both Great Britain and Israel as tools for internal security, the book employs a comparative analysis of these types of civilian defense policies and critically examines whether they are even possible in a robust federal republic such as the US.
