<td align="left" class="hometxt-in"><p>On a warm Saturday afternoon, 
              Khurram's wife promised to cook his favorite Persian dish which 
              is filled with tasty nuts. He was excited about helping her in the 
              kitchen. Happily he reached deep into the jar filled with nuts and 
              grabbed as many as he could fit in his hand.<br/>
<br/>
              When he tried to pull his arm out of the jar, it was stuck. As hard 
              as he pulled and twisted his arm, the jar would not release it. 
              His wife 
              pulled on the jar with all her strength, but it did not help. His 
              arm was stuck in the neck of the jar.<br/>
<br/>
              After several failed attempts they called out to their neighbors 
              for help. One neighbor, Jamal, came running over and asked how the 
              arm came to be stuck in the jar. With a voice filled of pain and 
              frustration Khurram told his story.<br/>
<br/>
              "Oh, I know how to help you, but you must do exactly as I say," 
              said Jamal.<br/>
<br/>
              "Yes, I promise to do everything you say, if you can just free 
              me from this terrible jar," Khurram replied.<br/>
<br/>
              "Okay, then push your arm further into the jar," Jamal 
              requested.<br/>
<br/>
              Khurram thought this request was strange and wondered why he should 
              put his arm further into the jar when he wanted to get it out of 
              there, but he did as he was told.<br/>
<br/>
              Jamal continued, "Now open your hand and drop the nuts you 
              have been holding." This request upset Khurram, because he 
              wanted the nuts for his favorite dish, but reluctantly, he followed 
              directions.<br/>
<br/>
              Jamal then said, "Make you hand very small and slowly pull 
              your arm out of the jar."<br/>
<br/>
              Khurram did as he was told and without any trouble he pulled his 
              arm out of the jar. All the other neighbors who had collected around 
              cheered and clapped, but Khurram wasn't completely satisfied. He 
              said, "My arm is free now, but what about the nuts?"<br/>
<br/>
              Hearing this, Jamal tipped over the jar and let several nuts roll 
              out onto a plate. Wide-eyed and with his mouth open in surprise, 
              Khurram asked, "Are you a magician?"<br/>
<br/>
              Note: I have also read this same story elsewhere with different 
              characters namely, a monkey and a wise owl. It is an old Persian 
              tale.</p>
