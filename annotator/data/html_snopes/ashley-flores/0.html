<h4>Buckle Up and Arrive Alive  during the holidays </h4>
<p><img alt="buckleup" class="newspic-left" height="363" src="http://web.archive.org/web/20071223025808im_/http://www.rollacity.org/images/Copy of Buckle Up-Arrive Alive windshield sticker.jpg" width="400"/>In an effort to ensure everyone  arrives safely at holiday gatherings this season, the Rolla Police Department  has joined forces with the Missouri Coalition for Roadway Safety to support the  âArrive Aliveâ campaign sponsored by the Missouri Department of Transportation.</p>
<p>âThe best way to ensure safe travel is to buckle up and drive sober,â  said SSgt. Rick Williams of the Rolla PD. âHeavy traffic coupled with Missouri  weather is enough to contend with, without adding alcohol or drugs to the mix.â</p>
<p>The holiday season is one of the deadliest periods of the year in  Missouri due to traffic crashes. During the 2006 Thanksgiving holiday weekend,  15 people died in nearly 1,400 crashes. Last year in Missouri, 273 people died  in more than 7,900 alcohol-related traffic crashes, resulting in a death or  injury every 1.6 hours.</p>
<p>In addition to a beefed up public information campaign and increased traffic  enforcement, âArrive Alive/Buckle Upâ window decals also will be displayed on  patrol cars.</p>
<p>Sergeant Williams said we are all part of the solution toward having a  safe and accident free holiday season, and to please consider the following  tips:</p>
<ol>
<ol>
<li>If you plan to drive, donât drink</li>
<li>Encourage safe driving behaviors among  family, friends and co-workers</li>
<li>Choose a designated driver before  partying. A designated driver is someone who drinks NO alcohol at all.</li>
<li>Take mass transit, a taxicab, or ask a  friend to drive you home</li>
<li>Party hosts should include  alcohol-free beverages</li>
<li>Spend the night where the activity is  being held</li>
<li>Report impaired drivers to law enforcement</li>
<li>Always wear your safety belt â itâs  your best defense against an impaired driver</li>
</ol>

<h4>City of Rolla and MRPC host Transportation Forum with Missouri House Speaker Jetton</h4>
<p><img alt="group" class="newspic-left" height="268" src="http://web.archive.org/web/20071223025808im_/http://www.rollacity.org/images/Copy of Transportation Forum - Dec. 10, 07 008.jpg" width="400"/>A few years ago, Missouri House Speaker Rod  Jetton walked his way from Marble Hill to St. Louis, in protest of the poor  highway conditions and the job being performed by the Missouri Department of  Transportation (MoDOT). On Dec. 10, Speaker Jetton met with Phelps County  officials at The CENTRE in Rolla for a Transportation Forum to share a  different story â one of praise for MoDOT and the great strides the agency has  made to improve the safety and quality of Missouriâs roads and bridges and  increase its efficiency to get the job done.</p>
<p>Speaker  Jetton, who began his two-week tour Dec. 3 in Jefferson City to learn about  Missouriâs roads and hear presentations from MoDOTâs 10 transportation  districts, provided a <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20071223025808/http://www.rollacity.org/events.shtm#ashley/Improving Missouri's Highway's and Bridges Presentation by Speaker Jetton.pdf">PowerPoint presentation</a> at the Dec. 10 forum titled  âImproving Missouriâs Highways and Bridgesâ that included a discussion of the  transportation infrastructure needs and challenges facing the state in the  coming years. To view the PowerPoint presentation, click <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20071223025808/http://www.rollacity.org/events.shtm#ashley/Improving Missouri's Highway's and Bridges Presentation by Speaker Jetton.pdf">here</a>. </p>
<p>"This tour is an excellent opportunity to see the state of Missouriâs  roads and bridges first hand,â Speaker Jetton said. âTransportation will be a  focal point of the upcoming session and the information we learn on this tour  will help in crafting legislative policy that will improve roadways for the  people of Missouri.â</p>
<p>Several  officials from the City of Rolla, Phelps County, Meramec Regional Planning  Commission (MRPC) and MoDOT attended the Transportation Forum hosted by the  City of Rolla and MRPC with Speaker Jetton (R-Marble Hill) Dec. 10 at The  CENTRE.</p>
<p><img alt="jetton" class="newspic-left" height="286" src="http://web.archive.org/web/20071223025808im_/http://www.rollacity.org/images/Copy of Transportation Forum - Dec. 10, 07 013.jpg" width="400"/>Tom  Stehn, MoDOT South Central District Engineer, kicked off the meeting by giving  an overview of some of the transportation projects that have been completed and  are being considered in District 9, which includes Phelps County.</p>
<p>Richard  Cavender, Executive Director of MRPC, thanked Speaker Jetton and Tom Stehn for  holding the transportation forum in Rolla and for providing a regional dialogue  regarding the transportation infrastructure projects that need to be discussed  and prioritized in the months and years to come.</p>
<p>City,  County and State officials who attended the forum included State Representative  Bob May, Rolla Mayor Bill Jenks, III, Rolla City Councilman Don Barklage, Rolla  City Administrator John Butz, Phelps County Presiding Commissioner Randy  Verkamp, Phelps County Commissioner Larry Stratman and Darrel Skiles, Presiding  Commissioner of Dent County.</p>

<h4>Rolla Police Department  offers new Law Enforcement âTorch Runâ T-shirts </h4>

<p>The  Rolla Police Department holds several Law Enforcement Torch Run events  throughout the year to benefit Special Olympics athletes including the Torch  Run, Trivia Night, Polar Plunge, Rt. 66 Motorcycle Classic, Battle of the  Badges Softball Tournament, and T-shirt sales.</p>
<p>The department has been involved in the Law Enforcement Torch Run since  1986. In 1993 Special Olympics â Missouri established the Torch Club to  recognize Law Enforcement Agencies that have raised at least $1,000 each year  for Special Olympics. This achievement allows the agencyâs name to appear on  the back of the Torch Run T-shirts for each year this is accomplished.</p>
<p>âMembers of the department are proud the Rolla Police Departmentâs name  has been on each shirt every year since 1993,â said SSgt. Rick Williams. âWe  owe all of this success to the citizens and businesses in and around Rolla.  Without your support we could not help over 14,000 athletes. Thank you for  helping us help the athletes.â</p>
<p>The front design on the Texas orange Torch Run T-shirt is the Torch Run  lettering emblazoned with flames. The long sleeve has blue lettering down the  left sleeve depicting the new slogan âIâm a Fan â Be a Fanâ. These shirts look  good with jeans, skirts or even dress slacks. The price for a childrenâs short  sleeve and adult short sleeve shirt is $10. Adult long sleeve shirts are $15.</p>
<p>To place an order for your 2008 Torch Run T-shirt, or for more  information, please contact SSgt. Rick Williams at the Rolla Police Department  at 364-6346, or visit the Cityâs Website at <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20071223025808/http://www.rollacity.org/">www.rollacity.org</a>.</p>

<h4>Rollaâs Diabetes Education Fund announces a special evening with Big George Brock and the Houserockers Jan. 12</h4>

<p> Guaranteed to be Rollaâs musical highlight of the season, come see for yourself why Big George is the undisputed King of the Saint Louis Blues â and he has the Heavyweight Champion of the Missouri Blues Harp belt to prove it! From the heart of the Mississippi Delta, by way of St. Louis, Big George has been entertaining audiences for over fifty years with his combination of original tunes and blues standards. He is the only man in the world who has knocked out both Sonny Liston AND music lovers everywhere.</p>
<p>This is the honest-to-goodness, back-breaking, lonesome-cotton-field, real-deal âDelta went Northâ blues. Big George has garnered four Blues Music Award nominations and won one Living Blues Critics Award. His newest CD, Live at Seventy Five, went to Number One on XM Radio's Bluesville. Big George has also played recently in: England, France, Switzerland, and Italy.</p>
<p> He recorded on Steven Seagal's all-star blues album Mojo Priest, on Jimbo Mathus' Live at Ground Zero album, and on Watermelon Slim's forthcoming live DVD. Come to Brunoâs Pub and Grill on January 12 for a night of entertainment that you will never forget.</p>

<p>The DEF is a tax exempt,  non-profit corporation that was established for the purpose of raising funds to  be distributed to organizations that teach diabetes management. The goal of the  DEF is to improve the quality of diabetes management through the education of  diabetics and those who care for them.</p>
<p>There is evidence that diabetes  was first described in 1500 BC on an Egyptian papyrus. Today, diabetes is the leading cause of adult blindness and  non-traumatic amputation. Proper management of oneâs diabetes is a critical  skill that all diabetics must learn. An estimated seventeen million Americans  have diabetes, one third of them are unaware of their condition. The cause of  diabetes is unknown and there is no cure. </p>
<p>All proceeds from this even will  be donated to the Central Missouri Diabetic Childrenâs Camp where diabetic  children learn to live healthy, productive lives.</p>

<h4>City addresses chemical spill downstream from  Vichy Wastewater Treatment Plant </h4>
<p>The  City of Rolla's Public Works Department quickly responded to an accidental  chemical spill in a creek approximately 500 yards downstream of the City of  Rolla's Vichy Road Wastewater Treatment Plant on Wednesday, Nov. 28.</p>
<p>The chemical, Calcium Hypochlorite (HTH),  which is similar to the elements found in bleach, was applied in the final  clarifier at the Vichy Road Wastewater Treatment Plant.</p>
<p>Upon discovering the spill, Allen McNece, the  City's Wastewater Superintendent, was in direct contact with the Missouri  Department of Natural Resources and the Missouri Department of Conservation on  Thursday, Nov. 29 to rectify the situation. McNece said HTH should never have  been used in this application.</p>
<p>"The  residents of Rolla can be assured that immediate action was taken to restore  the quality of water in the creek to its natural state and that no permanent  damage was done to the aquatic life," said Steve Hargis, the City's Director of  Public Works. "The HTH chemical dissipated within a few hours and the streams  returned to their natural states."</p>
<p>If residents or members of the community  have any questions regarding this incident, please call the Public Works  Department at 573-364-8659.</p>

<h4>City of Rolla Fire &amp; Rescue hosts Youth Firesetter Intervention Course </h4>
<p>The City of Rolla  Fire &amp; Rescue recently hosted a Youth Firesetter Intervention Course for 30  staff members and first responders from communities throughout Missouri. The  course was instructed by Rodger Windle, Fire Investigator Supervisor with the  Missouri Division of Fire Safety and Robert Sperberg, Assistant Chief of Fire  Prevention, Fort Leonard Wood Fire Department.</p>
<p>This course will allow the City of Rolla  Fire &amp; Rescue and members of the Youth Firesetter Coalition, to teach  parents of children who may be exhibiting firesetting behaviors to seek  assistance. Parents may be reluctant to seek assistance for a variety of  reasons, but the goal of a fire prevention coalition is to decrease firesetting  behaviors through prevention education. The coalition is not designed or  intended to discipline a child or to place a child into the courts system.</p>
<p>The City of Rolla Fire &amp; Rescue and  members of the Youth Firesetter Coalition are striving to establish several  trained teams throughout the state to ensure parents have accessibility to such  a valuable resource. Team members from various disciplines such as mental  health, elementary and secondary educators, social services, juvenile justice,  family services, law enforcement and, of course, fire service would be  available depending upon the situation.</p>
<p>The National Fire Protection Association  reports fires set by children yearly result in 95,000 fires, 300 deaths, 3,000  injuries and $300 million in losses. Children themselves are usually the  victims of these fires, accounting for 85 of every 100 lives lost. Most  children who set fires are between the ages of 5 and 9 and 95% of those fires  are set at home.</p>

<h4>Chief Kearse announces Special Assignments in  Rolla Police Department </h4>

<h4>D.A.R.E. program begins Nov. 28 for 5th graders  in Rolla schools </h4>
<p>The Rolla Police Department will begin  their 17th D.A.R.E (Drug Abuse Resistance Education) session  Wednesday, Nov. 28 for 5th graders in Rolla schools.Â  Over 7,500  Rolla students have successfully graduated from the D.A.R.E. program since its  inception.</p>
<p>The  D.A.R.E. program was started in 1983 by the Los Angeles Police Department in an  effort to educate elementary students on the dangers of alcohol, tobacco and  drug abuse. The Rolla Police Department adopted the program in 1990 and  selected Sgt. Wayne Rapier and former Rolla Police Officer Cody Fulkerson to  become certified in D.A.R.E. instruction.</p>
<p>The program began as a 17-week course taught to 5th graders  by uniformed Police Officers in the Rolla Public Schools, Parochial schools and  the Lutheran schools. Students are taught the dangers of drug, alcohol and  tobacco addiction and are presented with a variety of healthy alternatives and  to consider the consequences of this abuse. The students are also instructed on  the importance of building self esteem and to be assertive when confronted with  these dangers.</p>
<p>This program has proven to be very successful in preparing our youth for  what may lay ahead for them, and offers a positive approach in their decision  making to help combat the dangers of drugs, tobacco, alcohol and gang violence.  D.A.R.E. Officers are often approached by former students who relate that the  D.A.R.E. program has helped them prepare themselves to become responsible drug-free  adults.</p>
<p>Today, the D.A.R.E. program has been condensed into a 10-week curriculum  that offers that same basic lesson plan, but takes less time throughout the  school year. Sgt. Wayne Rapier coordinates the program and continues to teach  classes. Additionally, Corporal Scott Jarrett, Senior Patrol Officer's Mike  Phillips and Tony Lauth are also certified D.A.R.E. instructors who continue  this great tradition of providing a valuable service to our youth.</p>

<h4>Prepare early for severe weather conditions</h4>
<p>Despite the moderate  temperatures we have enjoyed this fall in the Ozarks, weather  conditions can change drastically from mild spells to thunderstorms, to bitter  cold and snow within hours.</p>
<p>As the Ozarks region experienced  last year,  winter storms can be devastating, and the rugged terrain in the Ozarks makes  winter weather conditions even more treacherous. Even though above normal temperatures and near normal precipitation are expected  across the region this winter, the Ozarks will still experience a variety of  winter weather conditions from mild spells to bitter cold.</p>
<p>Folks in  this region should stay tuned to the latest forecasts as winter  weatherÂ conditions can change rapidly. Â A good  idea before winter arrives is to prepare a <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20071223025808/http://www.redcross.org/services/disaster/0,1082,0_595_,00.html#Plan">winter storm plan  and disaster supplies kit</a>.Â Make sure your home is  well insulated and that you have weather stripping around your doors and window  sills to keep the warm air inside. </p>
<p>Winter storms are considered deceptive  killers because most deaths are indirectly related to the storm. People die in  traffic accidents on icy roads and from hypothermia due to prolonged exposure  to cold. During the historic ice storm of January 2007 several indirect  fatalities due to the extreme elements were documented. Carbon monoxide  poisoning occurred in some homes where gas generators were being used in  garages, which allowed for dangerous levels of carbon monoxide to seep into  houses.Â <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20071223025808/http://sema.dps.mo.gov/W07Deathsunsafeheating.pdf">Twenty six  Missourians died</a> during the 2006-2007  winter due to carbon monoxide poisoning.</p>
<p>To avoid the dangers of winter storms: Avoid over exertion, wear  layers of loose fitting warm clothing, have a winter storm survival kit in your  home and vehicles, and be sure to receive the latest weather information from  the National Weather Service.</p>

<h4>City Council  begins strategic planning for City's 10-Year Capital Improvement Plan</h4>
<p><img alt="council" class="newspic-right" height="293" src="http://web.archive.org/web/20071223025808im_/http://www.rollacity.org/images/Copy of 10-Year CIP Council Workshop Oct. 29, 07 013.jpg" width="400"/>What would we like to see the Rolla area look  like in the next 10 years? That question was at the center of a productive two-hour  discussion among Rolla City Council members and City staff who during a City Council  Workshop/Retreat Oct. 29 to begin the strategic planning process for the City's  preliminary 10-Year Capital Improvement Plan.</p>
<p>The  purpose of the workshop, which was facilitated by Richard Cavender, Executive  Director of the Meramec Regional Planning Commission, and City Administrator  John Butz, was to review both the funded and unfunded projects included in the  City's preliminary 10-Year Capital Improvement Plan (CIP) while engaging City  Council and Department Directors in a visioning process that will establish the  foundation and ground work for this important strategic planning document.</p>
<p>In  addition to the thought and effort that City staff devoted to the development  of the preliminary 10-Year CIP, considerable input was received from members of  City Council and City staff regarding the road map that will be used as a guide  to navigate our City and community over the next 10 years.</p>
<p><img alt="prioritylist" class="newspic-left" height="385" src="http://web.archive.org/web/20071223025808im_/http://www.rollacity.org/images/Copy of 10-Year CIP Workshop priority list Oct. 29, 07 011.jpg" width="500"/>Of  all the documents, including the recently adopted Rolla 20-20 Comprehensive  Plan, the City's 10-Year Capital Improvement Plan is right at the top in terms  of prioritization of projects, goal setting, vision setting and meeting the  most significant challenges our community is facing and will face in the next  10 years.</p>
<p>Many  of the ideas and projects discussed at the Oct. 29 Workshop are critical issues  facing our community such as infrastructure improvements, transportation  enhancements, economic development and expansion, enhancing the City's image,  and solidifying the Rolla/Phelps County area as a regional hub for not only  transportation, technology, education, health/medical care, recreation, and outdoor  activities, but also the retail and high tech industry.</p>
<p>Also  Â ranking high on the priority list during  the strategic planning session were the need to project a more prosperous,  successful, business friendly, and attractive image (i.e., property  maintenance, the City's gateway entrances, etc.), to developers, businesses and  individuals interested in locating in the Rolla area. Attracting both high tech  and light manufacturing/industrial businesses and jobs was also ranked high, as  was positioning the City as a sustainable and healthy (i.e., ample fitness and  recreational opportunities), community.</p>
<p>With  the input and priority setting data provided by City Council and staff, revisions  are currently being made to the preliminary 10-Year CIP. An updated draft of  the preliminary CIP will be posted in the next week or so on the City of  Rolla's Website. A copy of the Tentative Development Schedule outlining the  10-Year CIP planning and public input process can be viewed here. <br/>
      A  critical component of the 10-Year CIP will of course be community and public  input, which will be achieved through a series of Ward/Public meetings, public  hearings and the ETC Leisure Vision Citizen Attitude (Direction Finder) Survey,  which will be discussed and announced in the weeks and months ahead.</p>
<p>With  continued input and feedback from both the Rolla City Council, City staff and  members of the Rolla community, that the 2008 10-Year CIP will be both an effective  and flexible strategic planning document that will serve our community well for  the next 10 years. </p>

<h4>Striking costumes just part of Halloween Open House at RPD </h4>
<p><img alt="chaingang" class="newspic-right" height="285" src="http://web.archive.org/web/web/20071223025808im_/http://www.rollacity.org/images/Copy of Chain gang - RPD Halloween Open House.jpg" width="400"/>It seemed like half the town paid a  visit to the Rolla Police Department headquarters Halloween night to trick or  treat and pay a visit to members of the department who were barely recognizable  in their own outrageous Halloween costumes.</p>
<p>Dressed in stark black and white striped  prison-clad Halloween attire in the "Records Division" of the Rolla Police  Department were "Killer" Kandi Trentham,"Lefty" Laurie Dunn and Christy "Elvira" Moberly.</p>
<p>Following an exhaustive  manhunt, they were all apprehended without incident and sentenced to a full  shift of passing out of candy and friendly hellos. Rolla Police Chief Mark  Kearse said "the community can now breathe a sigh of relief knowing these  ladies served their sentence well, and are now right back where they belong  serving the citizens of Rolla!"</p>
<p>The annual Halloween Open House at the Rolla  Police Department is a long-standing holiday tradition that continues to grow  in popularity as members of the community are made to feel welcome and safe in  the Rolla community.</p>
<p>Other City departments who held Halloween  Open Houses and hosted costume contests, haunted houses and other Halloween  activities for children in the community included Rolla Fire and Rescue, The  CENTRE, Rolla's Health and Recreation Complex, and Public Works Department at  City Hall.</p>

<h4>Kiwanis Club brings "Hug a Bear"  Program to Rolla Police Dept. </h4>
<p>For the most part, citizens are generally not too excited about receiving something from a police officer such as a traffic summons, an accident report or some other type of official document.     But the "Hug a Bear" program is designed to change all that. </p>
<p>The Rolla Noon Kiwanis Club has coordinated this program in which cute, cuddly "teddy bears" are provided to Police Officers.     The officers carry the bears in their patrol cars and if they are involved in a situation where children have been traumatized or injured, the bears are offered as a means of calming the child. </p>
<p>The bears are soft and cuddly and when the children hug them it offers a bit of security and lets the children know they are safe that everything will probably be all right.     "We have been involved in the "Hug a Bear" program with the Rolla Kiwanis Club for the past 5 years and consider this a valuable tool in dealing with children that have been placed in bad situations" says SSgt. Rick Williams.     "We use the bears when children are involved in vehicle crashes, home fires, domestic disputes and even when a parent or other family member has to be arrested".     </p>
<p>The bears offer a means to help the children get over the ordeal and get back to their comfort zone. "We have gone through several hundred "teddy bears" since the program began and are grateful to the Rolla Noon Kiwanis Club for providing us with this resource," said Williams.</p>

<h4>Rolla Firefighters receive Hazardous Materials Certification </h4>
<p><img alt="certification" class="newspic-right" height="533" src="http://web.archive.org/web/20071223025808im_/http://www.rollacity.org/images/Copy of Hazardous Materials Technician Certification - 4 Firefighters.jpg" width="400"/>After  completing a rigorous Hazardous Materials training course, four City of Rolla  Fire &amp; Rescue firefighters recently received Hazardous Materials Technician  Certification.</p>
<p>Firefighters Alan Hill, Chris Recker, Kenny  Chase, and Jason Goebel were all recognized and congratulated for a job well  done by Fire Chief Robert Williams and Training Officer Ron Smith.</p>
<p>"I am fortunate to  have the opportunity to work with such a talented group of firefighters who are  not afraid to expand their skills while providing additional services to the  Citizens of Rolla," said Chief Williams.</p>
<p>The certification process is conducted in a three  step training cycle, which begins with an 8-hour Hazardous Material Awareness  class. The firefighters must then attend a 24-hour Hazardous Material Operations class,  followed by a 40-hour Hazardous Material Technician class.</p>
<p>The final class, which is  very hands-on, teaches the firefighters to make entry into the contaminated  area, stop the leak, and prevent any further exposure of the materials to the  public or the environment.</p>
<p>"Having the City's  firefighters trained, certified and prepared to respond to a Hazardous  Materials incident is an important benchmark for not only the Rolla Fire  Department, but the City of Rolla," said Chief Williams.</p>

<h4>Rolla Police Dept.  to discontinue Vehicle Lock-Out Assistance program</h4>
<p>In order to allow  Rolla Police Officers to be more effective in their critical law enforcement  efforts, the Rolla Police Department will discontinue the Vehicle Lock-out Assistance  program effective Monday, Oct. 8.</p>
<p>Rolla Police Chief Mark Kearse acknowledges  for the past several years, as a courtesy, Rolla police officers have responded  to requests from motorist to assist them in retrieving keys from locked  vehicles. On average Chief Kearse said officers spend over 720 man-hours per  year unlocking or attempting to unlock vehicles.</p>
<p>Although this program is a valuable service  to the motorist, liability issues have surfaced, and the department is  discontinuing the program Oct. 8. Chief Kearse cites the following reasons for  discontinuing the Vehicle Lock-Out Assistance program:</p>
<p>Many new cars have  side impact air bags that are very susceptible to damage when using improper  lock-out tools or techniques.</p>
<p>New cars have  sophisticated locking systems that do not respond well to outdated tools or  techniques, and successful entry to the vehicle is accomplished less than 50% of  the time.</p>
<p>The purchase of  proper equipment to access the newer vehicles is approximately $150 per  officer, which is over a $3,000 expenditure, not including training for each  officer to use the equipment.</p>
<p>In the past, several  vehicles have been damaged by officers attempting to defeat the locking devices.  Most motorists did not complain, but some made claims to the City for damages.</p>
<p>Even though this program was a valuable  service to motorists, the department feels that the officer's time can be better  spent on more critical services such as getting the officers back in our neighborhoods.  Vehicle lock-outs are not a law enforcement function and should be serviced by  a certified locksmith.</p>
<p>After Oct. 8 the Rolla Police Department  will respond to vehicle lock-outs only in an emergency situation, such as a  child locked inside a vehicle or medical situations. In non-emergency  situations, please check the phone directory for a lock smith service or  vehicle towing company.</p>

<h4>Rolla Police Dept. reactivates K-9 Unit </h4>
<p><img alt="adam" class="newspic-right" height="370" src="http://web.archive.org/web/20071223025808im_/http://www.rollacity.org/images/Copy of Adam Meyer w K-9 Ziggy.jpg" width="400"/>The Rolla Police Department is proud  to announce a new member has been added to their ranks, but the member will not  be in uniform. The newest member is a 15-month-old male Dutch Shepherd named  "Ziggy".</p>
<p>Ziggy recently graduated from a comprehensive training regiment that  concentrated on patrol work (attack), narcotics detection, building and area  search, article search and tracking. Ziggy will be partnered with Patrol  Officer Adam Meyer.</p>
<p>Officer Meyer has served with the Rolla Police Department since 2005 and  has an extensive background in both dog handling and dog training. He began his  law enforcement career in 1995 when he joined the U.S. Army and was trained in  military policing and K-9 enforcement.</p>
<p>Meyer is very excited to be working with his new partner and will begin  patrolling after a brief familiarization period where he and Ziggy learn each  other's patrol techniques. Officer Meyer describes Ziggy as a very friendly  dog, who can "turn it on" when he needs to! Ziggy will replace the department's  former Police dog named "Max," who retired in June 2005.</p>
<p>Rolla Police Chief Mark Kearse is also excited about activating the K-9  unit and describes "Ziggy" as a great asset to the department's overall mission.</p>
<p>"The K-9 unit is a valuable resource in our commitment to taking an  aggressive approach to fighting crime and illegal drugs," said Chief Kearse. "We  are very confident that Officer Meyer and Ziggy will contribute to our success  in reaching these goals.</p>

<p>"There's nothing like the thrill of holding a water hose that's shooting  out 125 gallons of water per minute," said Ron Smith, Training Officer with the  Rolla Fire Department. "Performing skills that our firefighters perform is  about as real as it gets."</p>
<p>In  addition to the fire hose spray, students participated in five other stations  that included a smoke house, the City's new Mobile Command Center, extrication  equipment, firefighter gear demonstration and ladder truck demonstration.</p>
<p><img alt="remote" class="newspic-right" height="329" src="http://web.archive.org/web/20071223025808im_/http://www.rollacity.org/images/Fire Prev Day at Truman  004.jpg" width="400"/>All  the activities held at Truman Elementary were part of a month-long Fire  Prevention Awareness Month campaign hosted by the Rolla Fire Department that  includes visits to <strong>Wyman Elementary</strong> and <strong>Mark Twain Elementary</strong>. The theme for this year's Fire Prevention Month was "Practice Your Escape."</p>
<p>Community-wide activities for Fire Prevention Month began Sept. 29 at  Denny Ford- Lincoln-Mercury with fire prevention materials, fire apparatus and  child safety seat installers. </p>
<p>In addition to the visits to the elementary  schools, Rolla Fire and Rescue also  participated in the <strong>Phelps County  Health Fair</strong> on <strong>Oct. 5</strong>  at The CENTRE (located at 1200 N.  Holloway Street in Rolla).</p>

<h4>Construction of  Southwest Wastewater Treatment Plant well underway </h4>
<p><img alt="southwest" class="newspic-right" height="297" src="http://web.archive.org/web/20071223025808im_/http://www.rollacity.org/images/Southwest Treatment Plant  - Web- Sept. 19, 07 003.jpg" width="400"/>If you haven't driven along Martin Springs  Drive in Rolla lately, you might not be aware of the significant construction that  is occurring at the Southwest Wastewater Treatment Plant facility located on  the far western edge of Rolla.</p>
<p>Built in 1966 to serve the west side of Rolla, the original Southwest  Treatment Plant was about one fifth the size of the new plant that is being  significantly expanded and improved. When completed at year's end, it will  serve an area of about 10-square miles, including the western portion of Rolla  and portions of the town of Doolittle (the City of Rolla and Doolittle entered  into a joint facility wastewater treatment agreement in 1996). This  construction project is yet another example of how the City's Public Works  Department and the City is addressing crucial infrastructure challenges for the  coming years.</p>
<p>With  aging mechanical systems, increasing sewage flows due to increased population  and tougher water treatment standards imposed by the Department of Natural  Resources (DNR), the expansion of this treatment plant was essential. This area  is also a future growth area that may someday serve the Rolla West development  that is currently being discussed and studied.Â Funding for the Southwest Treatment Plant was provided through a $3  million revenue bond election held in April 2006. The election passed with 82%  of the residents in favor of the funding. The City Council approved the second  of two 10-cent sewer increases per 1000 gallons, (the first increase was  approved in November 2006), of water at the Sept. 17 City Council meeting.  These increases will add about $1.20 more per month for the average sewer user.</p>
<p>Engineering services  for these improvements will be funded from the city's Sewer Service Capital  Reserve Account. This account is funded solely from user fees.</p>
<p>Cities throughout the country are realizing  more and more the necessity and value of investing in the maintenance and  improvements to their infrastructure. Fortunately in Rolla we have, for  sometime, been investing in our infrastructure, including over 100 miles of  newly paved city streets, 12 new storm water detention facilities, numerous box  culverts, the renovation of City Hall, new 12-inch water mains installed by  Rolla Municipal Utilities on Pine Street this summer and now the expansion and  improvements to the Southwest Wastewater Treatment Plant.</p>
<p>If you have any questions regarding the  expansion and improvements to the Southwest Treatment Plant, please call the  Public Works Department at (573) 364-8659.</p>

<h4>Rolla Police Officer saves two women in house fire </h4>
<p>On Sunday, Sept. 2 at approximately  6:30 a.m., Rolla Police Officer Greg Long was patrolling the area of North  Olive Street when he observed smoke coming from the attic vents and chimney of  an apartment building.</p>
<p>Officer Long approached the building and saw an interior wall of an  apartment fully engulfed in flames. He then contacted Central Dispatch and  requested that the Rolla Fire Department respond to his location for a  structure fire. Investigation revealed that the apartment on fire was not  occupied, but that an adjacent apartment may be occupied.</p>
<p>After banging on the door of the apartment Officer Long announced his  presence, but did not receive an immediate response. After several more  attempts he was met at the door by Deanna Stocum. Officer Long told her the  building was on fire and that she needed to leave immediately. Ms. Stocum  explained that her mother Dana Casto, was still inside and that she needed to  warn her of the fire.</p>
<p> Fortunately both women and their family dog escaped the fire without  injury. Further investigation revealed that the source of the blaze may have  been arson.</p>
<p>"I am very proud of Officer Long's actions and commend him for his attention  to detail while on patrol," said Rolla Police Chief Mark Kearse. "Ms. Stocum,  Ms. Casto and I firmly believe if it were not for Officer Long's quick actions,  the outcome of this event may have been very different."</p>
<p>Chief Kearse will present Officer Long with the Rolla Police Department's  Life Saving award at the department's award's banquet in November.</p>

<h4>Rolla Fire &amp; Rescue raises $3,421 at MDA Boot Drive </h4>
<p><img alt="boot drive" class="newspic-right" height="326" src="http://web.archive.org/web/20071223025808im_/http://www.rollacity.org/images/Copy of Fill the boot MDA fundraiser 330.jpg" width="400"/>Thanks to the generosity of area residents,  and the efforts of the City of Rolla Fire and Rescue, over $3,421 was raised  for the Muscular Dystrophy Association during a boot drive held Labor Day  weekend at the Rolla Wal-Mart Supercenter.</p>
<p>"The  support and generosity of both Wal-Mart and the public during the boot drive  was really what made this effort possible," said Ron Smith, Rolla Fire &amp;  Rescue Training Officer. "Our firefighters were very pleased with the great  response."</p>
<p>The  Muscular Dystrophy Association is a voluntary health agency â a dedicated  partnership between scientists and concerned citizens aimed at conquering  neuromuscular diseases that affect more than a million Americans.</p>
<p>MDA  combats neuromuscular diseases through programs of worldwide research,  comprehensive medical and community services, and far-reaching professional and  public health education.</p>
<p>MDA  supports more research on neuromuscular diseases than any other private-sector  organization in the world. MDA scientists are in the forefront of gene therapy  research and have uncovered the genetic defects responsible for several forms  of muscular dystrophy, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, a form of amyotrophic  lateral sclerosis (ALS, or Lou Gehrig's disease), childhood spinal muscular  atrophy, and several other neuromuscular conditions.</p>
<p>The  Association's comprehensive service program includes medical examinations, flu  shots, support groups, MDA summer camps for youngsters and assistance with the  purchase of wheelchairs and leg braces.</p>
<p>MDA  was created in 1950 by a group of adults with muscular dystrophy, parents of  children with muscular dystrophy, and a physician-scientist studying the  disorder. Since its earliest days it has been energized by it number-one  volunteer and national chairman, Jerry Lewis.</p>

<h4>Finding downtown  gets easier with new way-finding signage </h4>
<p><img alt="wayfinding" class="newspic-right" height="424" src="http://web.archive.org/web/20071223025808im_/http://www.rollacity.org/images/Copy of Wayfinding - P.O., Commun. Hall, h 007.jpg" width="500"/>Finding your way around town â especially  downtown Rolla â has become a lot easier thanks to the new way-finding signage  program implemented recently by the City's Public Works Department.</p>
<p>The  project was first conceived of over a year ago by Steve Hargis, Director of  Public Works, who was brain-storming with an ad-hoc committee established to  consider ways to enhance and revitalize the downtown area. The recent  renovations to the downtown band shell, which were completed by the Public  Works Department, were also among the projects the committee suggested, along  with the future construction of display cases to house train memorabilia in the  Frisco Caboose.</p>
<p>Funding for the way-finding project, band shell renovations and  enhancements to the Frisco Caboose was provided through a U.S. Housing and  Urban Development (Economic Development Initiative) grant awarded to the Rolla  Area Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<p>To  further defray the costs of the new signs that will provide additional  direction for motorists and pedestrians to municipal, county, civic and public  areas in Rolla, the Engineering Division designed, assembled and posted the  signs throughout the downtown area.</p>
<p>The  blue and white signs, which range in size from 20 inches by 10 inches, to 20 by  40 inches, are very similar in color to the blue and white "Welcome Rolla"  banners that are located along Pine, Rolla and Main Streets in the downtown  area. This was intentionally done to maintain a common color theme in the  downtown area. We hope that you will find that the white lettering on the dark  blue background is also very recognizable and easy to read.</p>
<p>While the majority of the 58 signs have already been posted in and  around the downtown area, including downtown arterial streets, and Hwy. 63, 72  and Kingshighway, the Traffic Division is  in the process of assembling  more signs, which should be posted in the next couple of weeks.</p>
<p>With  the recent resurfacing of Pine Street from 6th to 12th  Streets, and several side streets, the construction of the brick walkways at  the corner of 10th and Pine, renovation of the downtown band shell,  and way-finding directional signs, Rolla's downtown revitalization should prove  beneficial to the entire community.</p>
<p>The  next phase of the downtown enhancements to be completed by the Public Works  Department will include a new historical signage program that will showcase  many of the historical buildings and structures in and around downtown Rolla.  The historic signs will be designed in-house by the Traffic and Engineering  Divisions in Public Works at a considerable savings to the community.</p>

<h4>New Mobile Command Center is huge asset to City</h4>
<p><img alt="Mobile Command Cntr" class="newspic-right" height="250" src="http://web.archive.org/web/20071223025808im_/http://www.rollacity.org/images/Copy of MCC 011.jpg" width="400"/>Realizing the importance of being prepared  and equipped for an unexpected emergency, the City's Fire Department recently purchased  a new, state-of-the-art Mobile   Command Center  funded by a Homeland Security Grant through the State Emergency Management  Agency (SEMA).</p>
<p>The  new 37-foot-long by 12-foot-high vehicle, which is being housed at the City's  Fire and Rescue Headquarters (1490 East 10th Street), will be  a huge asset to the City and community in the event of a natural disaster (such  as a tornado, severe weather storm or earthquake), hazardous waste materials  spill, pandemic flu outbreak, weapons of mass destruction (WMD) event, or other  large-scale emergency.</p>
<p>Purchased from Burlington RV in Sturtevant, Wisconsin,  for $205,000, the vehicle is equipped to accommodate 13 emergency professionals, including  10 command staff and three dispatchers. It was designed by members of the  City's Fire and Rescue HAZMAT (Hazardous Materials) team who collaborated with  representatives from Burlington RV on the design and construction phases of the  vehicle.</p>
<p>Equipped with cutting-edge technology and equipment, the vehicle has  satellite TV in the front and rear; a 6-foot light tower that rotates 360  degrees; Mobile Command Internet capabilities; voiceover IP (Internet Provider)  capabilities for telephone communications via the Internet (in the event of  telephone or cell phone outages); a 5-foot satellite dish that can withstand 30  mile per hour winds; a 75-gallon fuel tank; an 8,000-watt diesel generator;  stabilizer jacks, 12-foot by 3-foot slide out room extension for more useable  space; 8-foot by 4-foot dry eraser board for strategic communications and dispatch  planning; a rear vision systems so the driver can see out the back of the unit  with side-mounted video cameras; ample internal and external (slide-out storage  trays) storage compartments and a 22-foot awning.</p>
<p>In  addition to the good news about the new Mobile Command   Center, the City has  achieved a high level of recognition by members of SEMA as one of the best  Homeland Security Response Teams (HSRT) in the state. The City's HAZMAT team recently  collaborated with and received assistance from the 7th Civil Support  Team â a National Guard Unit from Fort Leonard Wood, in creating an 80-page Standard  Operating Guideline (SOG) recently adopted by SEMA to be used by all 28  Homeland Security Response Teams (HSRT) in the state.</p>

<h4>Rolla Fire &amp; Rescue scores again with  ISO rating of 3 </h4>
<p><img alt="firepatch" class="newspic-right" height="305" src="http://web.archive.org/web/20071223025808im_/http://www.rollacity.org/images/Copy of Fire Dept. Patch 1.jpg" width="400"/>In less than six months after the City of Rolla dropped from a Class 5 to a Class 4 Fire rating, the  Insurance Services Offices (ISO) in Chicago,   Illinois notified the City that  it has now received an even better rating with a Class 3.</p>
<p>Dropping from a Class 5 to a Class 4 was a huge accomplishment for the  Rolla Fire Department and the City as a whole, but dropping two levels to a  Class 3 Fire rating in less than a year is a tremendous achievement. I would  like to join Fire Chief Robert Williams in expressing a special thanks to all  the business owners in the City of Rolla  for their patience and cooperation in allowing the Fire Department to inspect  their buildings. It was the first time all 1,000 businesses were inspected in  less than a year by the Fire Department. The lower Fire designation was also  made possible by a concerted effort from the Rolla Police Department, Rolla  Municipal Utilities, the Rolla Fire Department and the recommendations made  five years ago in a Fire Protection Study conducted by St. Louis Quint  Concepts, LLC. Chief Williams and his staff were very proactive in determining  through the study what it would take for the City's Fire Department to achieve  lower ISO Fire ratings.</p>
<p>After  reviewing the ISO's initial findings In November 2005 when the City received a  Class 4 Fire rating, the Rolla Fire Department realized the City was within a  few points of receiving a Class 3 designation. Realizing the significance of  achieving the Class 3 rating, the Fire Department installed dedicated fax lines  from the 911 Dispatch Center at the Rolla Police Department and the Rolla Fire  Dept. to the City's two fire stations in case the City's communication radio  system malfunctions during severe weather or power failures. The dedicated fax  lines provide a secondary and necessary means of communicating. This additional  communication feature is required by the ISO because the Rolla Fire Department  responds to over 700 calls for service each year. The fax line was implemented  for less than $1,000.</p>
<p>The City's new ISO Class 3 Fire rating takes  effect Nov. 1, 2006, and commercial and industrial businesses in the Rolla area  should see some reduction in their fire service insurance premiums depending on  what insurance company they are insured with. Residential customers could also  see some level of reduction in their fire insurance premiums. These reductions  in fire service related insurance premiums could ultimately result in over a $1  million savings City-wide on fire insurance.</p>
<p>The  Rolla Fire Department is among 44 other cities in the state to receive a Class  III Fire rating, which puts the City of Rolla  in an elite category with other larger metropolitan areas that typically have  larger tax bases and resources. Rolla now has one of the lowest Fire ratings of  any city between here and St. Louis and here and  Springfield -  if not the lowest.</p>
<p>The  ISO process is a very in-depth inspection process that covers the entire fire  operation, and the Rolla Fire Department is to be commended for diligently addressing  and enhancing the department's training, operations, equipment, records  management, dispatch and fire protection flows.</p>
<p>The  new Class 3 rating is indicative not only of the improvements and great strides  that the Fire Department has made since the city was surveyed just six months  ago by the ISO, but also of the increased cooperation among the Fire  Department, Police Department and RMU to lower the rating. The Class 3 rating  includes a range between 70.00 and 79.99 percent. The city received a score of 71.03  percent.</p>
<p>The City's  ISO Fire rating has also continually improved because the Rolla Police  Department's Dispatch   Center has significantly  upgraded all of their telecommunications equipment. The department also hired  more dispatchers. RMU also installed larger water mains and additional storage  capacity that provide the fire department with better water flows for fire  protection.</p>
<p>Be  assured that the changes and upgrades that were made to obtain the Class 3 Fire  designation significantly enhance the City's ability to respond to fire service  calls, provide excellent fire service to the community, and ultimately protect  the safety and well being of our residents.</p>

<h4>Ashley Flores Missing Child Hoax</h4>
<p>Initial reports in the media and on the  Internet of the missing 13-year-old Philadelphia  girl named Ashley Flores have proven to be nothing more than a very bad hoax,  according to numerous law enforcement agencies and credible news outlets.</p>
<p>Despite conclusive evidence that  the original missing person report and Amber Alert regarding Ashely Flores was  a hoax concocted by a kid's prank, the Rolla Police Department still receives  hundreds of calls every day regarding her status.</p>
<p>A variety of searches through  law enforcement agencies, including the Federal Bureau of Investigations, New  Jersey State Police and Philadelphia Police, and numerous missing child  websites such as The Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC),  confirms there has never been an official report of a missing girl named Ashley  Flores.</p>
<p>The Rolla Police Department is  trying to spread the word that although Ashley Flores may exist, reports of her  disappearance were an unfortunate internet hoax. Pranks such as these are not  only illegal, but also hamper and interfere with communications and law  enforcement operations.</p>

<h4>Mayor Jenks and Rolla City Council encourage participation in 'Helping Hand" program</h4>
<p>Rolla Mayor Bill Jenks,  III and the Rolla City Council encourage Rolla Municipal Utility customers to  participate in the "Helping Hand" program that has been sponsored by RMU for  several years to provide assistance for Rolla residents who need help in paying  their utility bills. </p>
<p>"I have already pledged  $2 a month for the "Helping Hand" program where 100% of your donations are  returned to the Rolla Community through the G.R.A.C.E. organization," said  Mayor Jenks. "I'm aware of at least one other City Council member who has  publicly pledged $1 per month to go towards the âHelping Hand' program as  well."</p>
<p>RMU collects, on a  voluntary basis, donations for the "Helping Hand" program with 100%  of your donations returned to the Rolla Community through the Greater Rolla  Area Charitable Enterprises organization. In 2006, GRACE, through the "Helping  Hand" program, disbursed 72 payments, helping 240 Rolla residents.</p>
<p>Mayor Jenks said if  3,000 of the approximately 8,000 RMU customers in Rolla were to voluntarily  pledge $1 per month towards the Helping Hand program, $36,000 could be raised  in 12 months.</p>
<p>"The great aspect  of this program is that it's 100% voluntary, and it is not using tax dollars in  any way," said Mayor Jenks. "This is a great vehicle to assist those who are having  difficulty paying their utility bills and I encourage anyone who can afford to  pledge $1 or more to participate in Helping Hand."</p>
<p>Enrollment forms  and a copy of the Helping Hand policy are available at the RMU Business Office  on 9th Street  in downtown Rolla. You may also contact RMU at 364-1572 or visit their Website at <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20071223025808/http://www.rollamunicipalutilities.org/">www.rollamunicipalutilities.org</a>.

<h4>Outdoor Warning System Can Save Your Life</h4>
<p>Along with flowers, fresh-cut grass and warmer temperatures, tornado season is also an aspect of spring that residents in South Central Missouri need to be mindful of. And while most tornados occur between the months of March and September, they can strike at any time, day or night.     </p>
<p>If you hear an outdoor warning siren, take cover immediately, go to an interior room on the lowest level of your home and avoid windows and doors. If you are in a mobile home or vehicle during a tornado or severe weather, evacuate them and get inside a substantial shelter. If no shelter is available, lie flat in the nearest ditch or other low spot and cover your head with your hands. If you don't have a basement or if you live in a mobile home, make arrangements in advance to stay with friends, relatives or neighbors who have a basement so that you will have appropriate shelter during an actual tornado "warning."     </p>
<p>The sirens are activated anytime a tornado warning has been issued for Phelps County and the warning's path cast specifically mentions Rolla in the path of the storm. Sirens will also be sounded when a severe thunderstorm warning indicates hurricane strength winds of 75 mph or greater are expected.    </p>
<p>"In addition to heeding the sound of a warning siren, you should be aware of changing weather conditions and monitor the weather through local and state media outlets," said SSgt. Rick Williams, the City's Emergency Management Director, who is responsible for activating the city's inclement weather warning system.     </p>
<p>Williams also reminds the community that on the first Wednesday of every month at 10 a.m. the Rolla Police Department tests the City's emergency warning system, which includes outdoor sirens and tone alert monitors at Rolla schools. "If you hear the sirens go off at this time realize that it is just a test to ensure the system is fully operational," said Williams.      </p>
<p>The Rolla Police Department also encourages residents to monitor your TV and radio news stations for updates and avoid calling 911 or the Rolla Police Department unless there is a true emergency.     To ensure you and your family are well prepared in case a tornado or severe weather storm does touch down in your neighborhood, you should have an updated emergency plan; an emergency kit that includes a flashlight, battery operated radio, bottled water and prescription medicines;  First Aid kit; cell phone and list of emergency/ contact information and three or four days of food in case the power goes out.        </p>

<h4>City receives $160,000 from MoDOT to construct Deible Bike Path, Phase II </h4>
<p>The City of Rolla was awarded $160,000 in enhancement funds from the Missouri Department of Transportation (MoDOT) to construct Phase 2 of the Deible Bike Path in Rolla.     </p>
<p><img alt="sarahACORN" class="newspic-left" height="385" src="http://web.archive.org/web/20071223025808im_/http://www.rollacity.org/images/Sarah riding solo with sign in background 012.jpg" width="400"/>Realizing what an important asset the city's system of bike/pedestrian paths and parks are to our residents and visitors, the Rolla City Council recently approved the MoDOT Agreement for the Deible Phase 2 Bike Path. The funds were made available through the Missouri Highway and Transportation Commission Transportation Enhancement Funds Program Agreement administered by MoDOT.     </p>
<p>The Rolla community already enjoys over 8 miles of bike trails along the popular Acorn Trail that adults and children of all ages enjoy walking, biking, roller blading or taking their pets for a casual stroll on. Phase I of the Deible Bike Trail, which is the design phase, will run from the Acorn Trail trail head at Highway O along Deible Branch to Sycamore Drive near Carriage Lane. This phase will be constructed in late 2007 or early 2008.     </p>
<p>The second phase of the Deible Bike Path will be an 8-foot-wide bike path that will run from Sycamore Drive near Carriage Lane along Deible Branch and parallel with Lions Club Drive. This phase will run west to Lions Club Park. A map illustrating the present and future planned bike/pedestrian trails in the city can be viewed <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/images/maps/BIKEPATH.pdf">here</a>. </p>
<p>Future phases of the City's bike/pedestrian trial system will include another 1.6 miles running north through Lions Club Park and eventually tie into the west trail head of the ACORN Trail at Green Acres Park, bringing the total length of the trail to nearly 11 miles. These future phases, which the City hopes to fund through future TEAA 21 Grants, will need additional documented support form the community to enhance the City's ability to compete for future funding with other communities.     </p>
<p>Anyone interested in providing a letter of support to encourage funding of future phases of the City's trail system should contact Steve Hargis, Public Works Director, at 573-364-8659 or e-mail him at <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20071223025808/mailto:shargis@rollacity.org">shargis@rollacity.org</a>.

<h4>ACORN Trail â Rolla's  Pedestrian/Bikepath Network continues to expand </h4>
<p><img alt="bikes" class="newspic-right" height="311" src="http://web.archive.org/web/20071223025808im_/http://www.rollacity.org/images/newspics/bikes.jpg" width="400"/>In addition to the vast network of spacious parks that enhance the quality of life in Rolla, the ACORN Trail also provides miles of pedestrian/bike paths that are enjoyed year round.     </p>
<p>Adults and children of all ages enjoy walking, biking, roller blading or taking their pets for a casual stroll on this 9.2 mile-long trail that currently connects to 9 City parks. If you love the outdoors, nature and serenity, you will love the ACORN Trail and all the wildlife, scenic beauty and enjoyment it provides.     </p>
<p>The majority of the trail was funded over the years through several Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act (ISTEA) and Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA21) grants form the Missouri Department of Transportation.    </p>
<p>The first phase, completed in 1997, consisted of the installation of approximately 1.6 miles of sidewalk form the Visitor Center on Bridge School Road to and around the University of Missouri-Rolla Golf Course. The second phase, completed in 2000, saw the addition of another 2 miles of eight-foot sidewalk form Green Acres Park to Highway 72 along the Dutro Carter Creek and included a pedestrian footbridge, wildlife food plots, an interpretive forest, and off street parking. The third phase of the project, completed in 2002, consisted of the construction of approximately 3.9 miles of sidewalk connecting the previously constructed phases I and II, creating a 7.5 mile long walking/biking facility. A series of five-foot walks were built through the urbanized portions of the community.     </p>
<p>Phase IV, a 0.95 mile stretch of sidewalk completed in 2003, connects the southeast portion of town to the previous three phases of the bikepath and runs southeasterly along Highway 72 to Osage Drive. Phase V, which is the construction/contract phase, will run east from the intersection of Tenth Street and Forum Drive along the south side of Tenth to its intersection with Lovers Lane. This fifth phase is scheduled to be completed in the summer of 2007, and will add an additional .75 miles of eight-foot walk, for a total of 9.2 miles.     </p>
<p>Beginning in late 2007 or early 2008, the next phase will be an 8-foot-wide bike path that will run from Highway O to Sycamore Drive (the trail head of the ACORN Trail), along Deible Branch and parallel with Lions Club Drive. It will run west to Lions Club Park for 1.7 miles, bringing the total length of the trail to 11 miles.     </p>
<p>Future phases will include another 1.6 miles running north through Lions Club Park and eventually tie into the west trail head of the ACORN Trail at Green Acres Park. These future phases, which the City hopes to fund through future TEAA 21 Grants, will need documented support form the community to enhance the City's ability to compete for future funding with other communities.     </p>

<h4>MODOT selects Rolla National Airport for upgrades </h4>
<p><img alt="airport" class="newspic-left" src="http://web.archive.org/web/20071223025808im_/http://www.rollacity.org/images/newspics/aerial of airport.jpg"/>The City of Rolla was recently notified by the Missouri Department of Transportation that the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/airport/airport.shtm">Rolla National Airport </a>has been awarded millions in funding for improvement to the facility.</p>
<p>The Rolla National Airport (located just 13 miles from Rolla off Hwy. 63 in Vichy), is not only a great regional aviation transportation center, but also an economic engine that could attract industries and businesses to an industrial park also planned for the airport's future.</p>
<p>In addition, the airport, which boasts two runways and several hangers, has been designated by the State Emergency Management Agency (SEMA) as an Aviation Staging Area that would be used during state emergencies for the deployment of medical personnel, equipment and supplies in the event of a state-wide emergency such as an earthquake along the New Madrid Fault, pandemic flu outbreak or an Homeland Security related exercise or event.</p>
<p>The multi-million dollar improvements MODOT is offering the City in the foreseeable future could include the lengthening of runway 4-22 at Hwy. 28 from 5,500 feet to 7,000 feet, which would allow for much larger aircraft to land. MODOT would also build a parallel taxiway for runway 13-31, construct a new airport terminal building and construct an Omni Dash Directional Approach Light System (ODDALS) and Precision Approach Path Indicator (<acronym title="Precision Approach Path Indicator">P.A.P.I.</acronym>). This new hi-tech instrumentation, along with the installation of a Visual Glide Slope Indicator (V.G.S.I.) will provide upgraded systems that will greatly enhance the all weather approach system.</p>
<p>In the event the airport is used as a designated Aviation Staging Area, the runway at Rolla National Airport would be extended with the placement of large corrugated steel slabs that would allow C-140s carrying emergency medical personnel, supplies and equipment to land and take off. In a worse-case scenario such as an earthquake along the New Madrid Fault near St. Louis, the Missouri National Guard would also be deployed to the airport to assist with medical transport, evacuation and traffic management along Hwy. 63, if necessary.</p>
<p>The importance of the Rolla National Airport is highly recognized by local, state and federal agencies and officials in terms of its strategic location along Hwy. 63, South Central Missouri and its proximity to other major population centers.</p>

<h4>New storm water retention facilities aid economic development </h4>
<p>Most everyone is aware of the importance that the City's infrastructure such as streets, roads, water lines, sewage systems and storm water retention facilities play in the quality of life that Rolla residents enjoy.     </p>
<p>That said, Rolla Mayor Bill Jenks would like to bring to the community's attention and awareness to the efforts of the Public Works Department over the last three years to oversee the planning and construction of no less than six large storm water retention facilities throughout the community.    </p>
<p>The construction of these retention facilities are helping the City address issues related to storm water retention, flood control improvements and the growing need for storm sewer system upgrades. Since most of these storm water detention facilities are located in hard-to-access areas, however, they are unfortunately not easily seen or appreciated by the public.    </p>
<p>The six storm water facilities I'm referring to include: Tory Park Detention Facility (located just east of the Forum Cinema off Tory Avenue); the Bray Sports Complex Detention Facility located adjacent to the Rolla High School (the ball field doubles as a dry detention facility â protecting downstream homes from possible flooding); the Taylor Anderson Detention Facility; Vichy Road Storm water Detention Facility; White Columns Drive Detention Facility and the RCDC Storm water Detention Facility (located just west of the Rolla Industrial Park).     </p>
<p>Other projects associated with these flood control improvements identified in the City's 10-year Capital Improvement Plan implemented in June 2005 include the construction of 10 box culverts. These along with the six storm water retention facilities, will be completed by December of this year. The total cost of these improvements was funded by a no-tax-increase bond issue of $3 million and a $180,000 Missouri Department of Transportation Grant.  These bonds will be retired using the existing Â½ cent Capital Improvement Sales Tax.</p>
<p> While the paramount benefit of storm water detention improvements will ultimately remove nearly 200 homes from the 100-year flood plain, the economic development benefits derived should not be overlooked. These vast improvements to storm water retention are also paving the way for more prosperity in the City of Rolla and enhancing our quality of life through additional recreational opportunities such as the dry detention facility at the Bray Sports Complex and new park opportunities along Lions Club Drive. In addition to these flood control benefits, the City has added 120 acres of open space and conservation area to preserve and enhance Rolla's sensitive eco-systems.    </p>
<p>Infrastructure upgrades and improvements such as new storm water detention facilities, roads and sidewalks are all areas that prospective developers, real estate investors and contractors look closely at when considering which areas in a region they might want to invest, build or expand in.    </p>
<p>With the assistance of engineering consultants, the City has also identified over 30 neighborhoods that have localized storm water drainage problems. These projects, which are part of the Public Works' annual street and storm sewer maintenance activities, are being prioritized in terms of severity, street maintenance schedule and availability of funds. The City appreciates the community's patience and cooperation as we continue to address these very important improvements.    </p>
<p>Although many of these storm water retention improvements are not easily seen, Mayor Jenks hopes that the community will recognize the value and importance of the large scale infrastructure improvements that continue to be made in the City of Rolla. </p>
