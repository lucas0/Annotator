<big>Addressing the Dell Issue. 2/26/02</big></strong></p>
<p align="center">This is the letter I posted in a few Firearms Forums and sent via e
mail.<br/>
This is a true account of my dealings with Dell over the past few weeks.</p>
<hr/>
<p>I am writing this because I feel every Firearms owner should know<br/>
this story. <br/>
I placed an order for a Dell notebook computer on February 13 on line<br/>
with Dell. I was given a tentative delivery date of February 21st. I<br/>
was watching the order through the Dell on line tracking system; I<br/>
also opted for the automatic email notification of when the machine<br/>
was to be shipped. Well the 21st came and went, I am a Pistolsmith I<br/>
know things can happen. I made a phone call on the 25th, did a<br/>
voice mail message for my salesman to get back to me and I was<br/>
looking for the delivery date. The 25th came and went with no<br/>
callback. On the 26th I placed another call this time to cancel the<br/>
order. After a few hours I got a call back, with this amazing reason<br/>
for the delay. It seems someone in Dell had already canceled my<br/>
order, when I asked why I was told Dell was afraid I was going to<br/>
use the machine for illegal purposes. When I asked why someone<br/>
would think that I was told it was because of the name of my<br/>
business “Weigand Combat Handguns Inc.”. Because I am involved in<br/>
firearms I might be doing something illegal. Now keep in mind I was<br/>
never called or informed of this decision the order was just canceled.<br/>
Many of you know me personally and know I run my business about<br/>
as squeaky clean as possible. In addition being the President of the<br/>
American Pistolsmiths Guild I am under additional scrutiny as to how I<br/>
run my business, if I am not clean how can I be the President of an<br/>
organization that promotes just that! I was informed by a Dell<br/>
supervisor not long after all of this the reason I was refused was<br/>
because of their post September 11th policy of screening buyers. <br/>
I would like to respectfully ask the firearms community to do the<br/>
following. If you intended to buy a Dell and because of this letter you<br/>
do not, email Dell and let them know why. Feel free to distribute this<br/>
account to all you know in the Firearms community, I think they need<br/>
to know. I for one am sick and tired of people assuming just because<br/>
we are involved with firearms that we are doing something illegal. I<br/>
also do not believe Dell deserves our business if this is how they<br/>
intend to treat us. <br/>
God Bless <br/>
Jack Weigand <br/>
President <br/>
American Pistolsmiths Guild Inc.<br/>

<p>The above is the only letter I have written. I have written comments on email I have
received (that number is now in the hundreds). I would like to add the following.</p>
<p><big><strong>I have spoken to Dell today 2/26/02</strong></big></p>
<p>They informed me that the reason my order was cancelled was due to the new post 9/11
screening policy. The word <br/>
"Combat" in my company name is what triggered the cancellation of my order. The
cancellation was triggered automatically. When I asked why I was not called to clear this
up I was told there was a breakdown in communications on Dells part.</p>
<p><strong>Just for the record so everyone knows where I stand.</strong></p>
<p>I have no intention of further dealings with Dell, they don't deserve my business.</p>
<p>I want nothing from Dell but I would gladly accept an apology to the Firearms community
in general.</p>
<p>I posted this expressly to warn firearms owners of Dell policies <strong>PERIOD</strong>.</p>
<p>There are those that think I did this to generate traffic to my web site. All this
traffic just made it hard for my customers to shop this evening. If you will notice there
are no advertisements on my web so traffic is not a factor. It has also generated hundreds
of email that I personally answered. Just so you all know I am not smart enough to do a
publicity stunt of this magnitude on purpose, LOL!</p>
<p><strong>I would humbly request the following.</strong></p>
<p>Please, please refrain from making personal attacks on Michael Dell. I have received
hundreds of e mails attacking Mr. Dell, please do not do this. I know we are all
passionate about our right to keep and bear arms but please be as professional as
possible.</p>
<p><strong><small>I thank all of those that took the time to confirm that this story was
true before spreading it, you all are to be commended!</small><br/>
</strong></p>
<hr/>
<p><big><strong>Update 2/27/02</strong></big></p>
<p>After fielding hundreds of emails and dozens of phone calls today my heart felt thanks
to all who responded. </p>
<p>I was contacted by a Dell representative this morning a Mr. John Hood. John made the
following remarks.<br/>
                           
He extended Dells sincerest apologies for the incident.</p>
<p>                           
He said Dell would review and possibly change the screening policies to prevent this from
happening
                             
again.</p>
<p>                           
Dell offered to ship the machine I ordered to me at no charge, I respectfully declined the
offer.</p>
<p>                           
John told me he would have a statement sent to me sometime Thursday morning the 28th
stating Dells
                             
position on this issue for me to post here for all to see.</p>
<p>I will post the statement as soon as I receive it.<br/>
</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong><big>2/28/02 </big>Update</strong>  Statement from Dell</p>
<font size="2">
</font><p><font size="2">To Our Valued Customers and Friends:<br/>
U.S. export laws restrict the sale of technology to terrorists and to people<br/>
in countries that support terrorism. These laws also prohibit computer sales<br/>
to people who will use the technology in developing biological or nuclear<br/>
weapons. Dell strictly complies with our country's export laws in order to<br/>
ensure the safety of our customers and citizens around the world. When there<br/>
is reasonable cause for concern, we carefully review customer orders for<br/>
prohibited destinations and activities.<br/>
When additional follow-up on an order is required, our sales representatives<br/>
ask our customers four basic questions:<br/>
1. Who is the end-user?<br/>
2. Where will the product be used?<br/>
3. What will the product be used for? <br/>
4. What type of business or industry is involved? <br/>
The answers to these questions, like all customer information we gather, are<br/>
confidential and are not shared outside of Dell. <br/>
We recently received an order from Mr. Jack Weigand, whose company name,<br/>
"Weigand's Combat Handguns Inc." included the word "combat." We
cancelled<br/>
the order to give us enough time to follow up with the customer and be<br/>
assured that the sale would be in compliance with U.S. export law. However,<br/>
we failed to contact Mr. Weigand, and as a result, we did not deliver the<br/>
order as promised, and the customer did not know why. Once we discovered our<br/>
error, we apologized to Mr. Weigand for this misunderstanding, as well as<br/>
the inconvenience caused by the delay. This is not the service standard that<br/>
we hold ourselves to at Dell.  <br/>
We at Dell feel a strong obligation to uphold our federal law, but we have<br/>
just as strong an obligation to be responsive to the needs of all our<br/>
customers.  We want to assure you that the company does not discriminate<br/>
against any business, regardless of the products or services they sell, nor<br/>
do we discriminate against individual consumers. We do, however, sometimes<br/>
make mistakes - as we did in this case. <br/>
Thank you for your support. <br/>
Sincerely,<br/>
Dell Computer Corporation<br/>

<p><strong>This is the link that has been circulating<br/>
<font size="3"><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20020305222533/http://www.progressivefunds.com/hci/">http://www.progressivefunds.com/hci/</a></font><br/>
<br/>
<font size="3">I felt it was my obligation to post the following</font><font size="4"><br/>
</font></strong>The following is a portion of a Dell statement that addresses the above
link    <strong>This was added 3/02/02</strong></p>
<p>We appreciate the opportunity to clarify the facts regarding a customer<br/>
issue reported in the media and Dell's position on political or social<br/>
issues that many of you care deeply about.<br/>
Regarding Handgun Rights/Handgun Control....<br/>
Dell is a publicly-traded, customer-focused company with customers,<br/>
shareholders and employees on both sides of many public, social and<br/>
political issues. Our place is to serve our customers rather than to<br/>
endorse or support one position over another in public debates outside the<br/>
scope of our industry.<br/>
We do not discriminate against any business, regardless of the products or<br/>
services they sell, nor do we discriminate against individual customers.<br/>
We do, however, respect the right of any organization or individual to<br/>
have their own point of view. We follow all laws, rules and regulations.<br/>
Regarding allegations that Dell supports Handgun Control organizations<br/>
through the Dell Affiliates program...<br/>
Dell as a company remains neutral on handgun rights and handgun control.<br/>
Dell customers can support causes and organizations, if they choose,<br/>
through Dell's affiliates program and charitable websites such as<br/>
igive.com and progressivefunds.com. These sites feature links to Dell's<br/>
website. Dell's affiliates program provides a way for customers to support<br/>
the cause or organization of their choice through their Dell purchases.<br/>
Affiliate participants, such as igive.com and progressivefunds.com,<br/>
include organizations and causes on different sides of nearly every social<br/>
issue. <br/>
Some of the organizations participating through Dell affiliates such as<br/>
igive.com and progressivefunds.com., promote handgun rights, others<br/>
promote handgun control. Handgun Control Inc. (HCI) has been reported as<br/>
one organization that participates in this program. Others including The<br/>
Gun Owners Foundation and the Michigan Coalition for Responsible Gun<br/>
Owners Foundation, Inc. also participate through Dell affiliate igive.com.<br/>
<br/>
The only organizations prohibited from participating in Dell's affiliates<br/>
program are those that promote sexually explicit material; promote<br/>
violence; promote discrimination based on race, sex, religion,<br/>
nationality, disability, sexual orientation or age; or promote illegal<br/>
activities.<font size="3"><br/>
</font></p>
<hr/>
<p><font size="4"><strong>3/01/02    </strong>Update</font></p>
<p><font size="3">The free computer offer from Dell is a hot topic in much of the email I
have received to date. <strong>I have since purchased a notebook computer elsewhere</strong>
so I hope that issue is settled.<br/>
<br/>
Again I thank everyone for your thoughts and comments. I will say I don't agree with some
of the letters but we are Americans, we have the right to free speech.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">Please keep in mind when reading postings on my site. I have no public
relations department to draft and polish my postings. I think long and hard about what
needs to be said and I post it. Please forgive me for being a little crude in my writing,
keep in mind I am a Pistolsmith not a writer.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">I am doing my best to keep up with the email, over 1000 to date. I read
every email I receive and respond to 99% of it. <br/>
</font></p>
<hr/>
<p><big><strong>3/02/02 </strong>Update</big></p>
<p><big>Please go to the following link at the NRA/ILA web site</big></p>
<p align="center"><big> <strong><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20020305222533/http://www.nraila.org/ActionAlerts.asp?FormMode=Detail&amp;ID=101">http://www.nraila.org/ActionAlerts.asp?FormMode=Detail&amp;ID=101</a></strong></big><br/>
Title: <strong>DELL AND OUR RIGHT TO ARMS</strong></p>
<p><br/>
<big>   </big><br/>
Dell has issued a second statement, many of you have received via email. The letter
contains the following statement:</p>
<p><strong>"We have tried to make it right with our customer by<small> </small>giving
him a free computer for his trouble and inconvenience</strong><small>."</small></p>
<p>I have not accepted a computer from Dell. I have purchased a computer from another
manufacturer.<br/>
</p>
<hr/>
<p>Again I thank the Firearms community as a family for being so willing to come to my
aid.</p>
<p>God Bless<br/>
Jack Weigand<br/>
President<br/>
Weigand Combat Handguns Inc.</p>
