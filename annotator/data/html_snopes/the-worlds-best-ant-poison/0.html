<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Ants are the most dominant group of social 
insects</b>.  In the savanna of the African Ivory Coast the density of ants is more than 7,000 colonies and 20 million 
individuals per hectare.  Ants belong to the insect Order Hymenoptera and are close relatives 
of bees and wasps.  Throughout the world there are over 20,000 species of ants, but 
only about 50 are known to be pests of the food or structures of man.  Except for the 
polar regions and a couple of islands, they flourish on all land areas of the earth, from 
rain forests to deserts.  All pest control technicians become involved with ant problems at some point in 
their career— most commonly because ants are found foraging or nesting inside structures - or because 
swarming ant reproductives are confused with swarming termites.  Only a comparatively small proportion of ants 
cause damage - only these ants are considered to be pests around our homes and buildings because they feed 
on and contaminate our food stuffs, damage our wood structures, build unsightly mounds in our lawns and 
even fewer ants are aggressive  and are able to inflict painful bites or stings.  Most ants are extremely 
beneficial cleaning up mess after mess and up to 95% of all weed seeds!  (They truly are nature's little garbage 
collecting ladies.)</font>
</p><p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Foraging -</b> Ants are omnivores and eat a wide variety of food, including other insects, seeds, nectar, 
meats, greases, sugars and honeydew.  Honeydew is a liquid produced by plant-sucking insects, such as aphids 
or plant , mealy bugs (groups of small insects with a white powder clinging to them), scale insects, and 
plant hoppers. These insects feed in groups on plant stems and leaves. Many species of ants protect these 
aggregations from other insects.  Ants are a part of this pattern; they also take drops of honeydew 
continuously produced by the small sap-sucking individuals .  Some ant species appear to just wander randomly; 
others trail each other precisely from colony to food and/or water source and back.  Most ants follow 
structural guidelines as they travel, rather than in a straight "beeline".  Ants communicate with each other using 
different methods, including pheromones, touch and stridulaton (sound production), for transmitting messages. 
 Workers foraging for food attract attention and communicate their messages when they return to the colony. 
 Honey seems to really attract honeydew-eating ants.  Add 5% or less boric acid or sodium borate or 
food-grade DE to make an excellent sweet bait which has both a food attractant and a convenient 
moisture source.</font>
</p><p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>ANT CONTROL AND MANAGEMENT -</b> The best control for ants is cleanliness.  The ant's greatest 
enemies are other ants. It is important to note that all of the ants found indoors, only a few species are responsible 
for the majority of infestations; some species are not common inside a structure but appear sporadically; 
and other types of ants are found inside only under rare or accidental conditions.  While the third group is 
difficult to prepare for, the first group will be studied, discussed, and control experiences analyzed.  The middle 
group may take an inordinate amount of your time, with  inconclusive results.  These elusive ants may appear 
 several times in one year, then not be encountered for  several years.  Some are more or less common 
in some  regions and uncommon in others.  Remember, most ant infestations originate outside the building.</font>
</p><p><font face="Arial" size="2"> </font><b><font face="Arial" size="2">I have found schools that have been sprayed with various volatile, synthetic pesticide poisons 
once a week for 15 years or more without every getting "control".  Ants are the most common cause 
of callbacks for the pest control industry, so why use their volatile poisons?</font>
</b></p><p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">Inspection -</font></b> <font face="Arial" size="2"> The key to virtually any ant control is to find the nest.  All ants are social insects that 
live cooperatively in a colony.  Large numbers of ants can be killed without ever solving your pest infestation. 
 Keep a daily log or record of where ants are seen.  Bait the workers with jelly, peanut butter, cut-up 
crickets, oils, proteins, etc., and follow them back to their nests, or inspect with a yellow or red light at night.<br/>

          Karo Syrup, cornstarch, honey, molasses, peanut butter and/or jelly.  Use baits with non-volatile stomach 
          poisons, e.g., boric acid, borax or sodium borate.  Baits are excellent in critical areas, e.g., computer or 
          hospital rooms.  Mix (5% or less) food-grade DE, boric acid (or borax) into any food you see the ants      
          eating - if the ants die by the poisoned bait - use less boric acid or borax -
    <b>be careful not to allow children, pets or wildlife to eat these toxic 
baits.</b>  Remember to routinely switch from carbohydrate back 
          to protein baits, or use both.  Do not spray or  dust around baits.  Never store baits or bait materials      
          where they can be contaminated with any other odors, especially smoke or fumes of volatile pesticides.  
          Ants and other insects can detect minute amounts of foreign or repellent chemicals and will avoid chalk
