</p><p>
   BALTIMORE (May 5, 1996 - 02:53 EST) -- This time, the Baltimore Orioles took advantage of yet another one of Brady Anderson's leadoff homers.</p><p>

   Anderson homered for the fourth time in three games and Roberto Alomar hit a grand slam Saturday as the Orioles defeated the slumping Milwaukee Brewers 10-5 Saturday.</p><p>

   Anderson's major-league leading 15th homer sparked a four-run first inning that gave Baltimore the lead for good. It was the sixth game this season he led off the Oriole first inning with a homer but only the first time Baltimore went on to win.</p><p>

   "I really have no idea what effect it has, but it's a run so it has to help," Anderson said.</p><p>

   "So what if we lost the other five? That's just one of those stats," teammate Tony Tarasco said. "How else would you want to start a game? What could be better than getting one run out of one at-bat?"</p><p>

   Anderson's six leadoff homers in one season broke the club record of five, set by Don Buford in 1971. It's the 17th time Anderson has done it in his career.</p><p>

   Now in his ninth season, Anderson has never had a home-run binge quite like the one he's enjoying this week. He hit one homer against New York on Wednesday and two Friday night against the Brewers.</p><p>

   "It's pretty amazing. You don't think it's possible that he could hit another, and then there it goes," Tarasco said.</p><p>

   Milwaukee got a run in the first on an RBI single by Kevin Seitzer, but the Orioles countered with four runs against Steve Sparks (1-4). Anderson drove a 3-2 pitch over the right-field wall and Sparks loaded the bases with three straight walks before Tarasco cleared them with a double.</p><p>

   "I thought I punched (Anderson) out twice, then I end up leaving one up," Sparks said. "Then, after those walks, I had to throw Tarasco a fastball and he took advantage of it."</p><p>

   Long after Sparks departed, Alomar's second career grand slam made it 10-2 in the sixth.</p><p>

   Jeffrey Hammonds also homered for the Orioles, who have won two straight after losing 11 of 14.</p><p>

   Mike Mussina (4-2) allowed two earned runs and 11 hits in 6 2-3 innings to end a two-game losing streak. The right-hander struck out eight and walked two.</p><p>

   "Mike really didn't have great stuff, but he pitched a great game," Baltimore manager Davey Johnson said.</p><p>

   "It's nice to get a win, but I wish I could have pitched better," Mussina said. "A lot of innings I'm allowing a lot of baserunners, and that's something I haven't been accustomed to."</p><p>

   Matt Mieske and Jose Valentin homered for the Brewers, who have lost five straight overall and seven consecutive road games.</p><p>

   Mieske got Milwaukee to 4-2 by leading off the second with his fourth homer, but Hammonds chased Sparks with a two-run shot in the third. Sparks has allowed 23 runs in his last three starts and has an ERA of 8.83.</p><p>

   "It was the best knuckleball I've had all season, but I couldn't get it over," Sparks said. "I just didn't get ahead of guys and I lost the feel of it for a while."</p><p>

   After the Orioles loaded the bases against Michael Potts in the sixth, Alomar hit the first pitch from Kevin Wickander into the left-field seats. Alomar went 2-for-4, raising his batting average to .358 with his major-league leading 15th multi-hit game of the year.</p><p>

   Valentin homered off Mussina with two aboard in the seventh.
Notes: Actor Kevin Costner watched the game with Cal Ripken's wife, Kelly, in the front row behind the screen. ... Mussina came in with a career 4.45 ERA against Milwaukee, the worst against any AL team. ... Milwaukee starters have a 9.49 ERA over the last 11 games. Brewer pitchers have allowed 17 homers in the last six games. ... Milwaukee's Fernando Vina broke a 1-for-17 slump with two singles. ... The start of the game was delayed 26 minutes by rain.</p><p>
