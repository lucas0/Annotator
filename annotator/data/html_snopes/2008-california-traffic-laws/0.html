                        JANUARY 17, 2007

   An act to repeal and add Section 23109.2 of the Vehicle Code,
relating to vehicles, and declaring the urgency thereof, to take
effect immediately.



	LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S DIGEST


   SB 67, Perata. Vehicles: speed contests and reckless driving.
   Existing law, as of January 1, 2007, allows a peace officer to
arrest and take into custody a person that a peace officer determines
was engaged in a motor vehicle speed contest and permits the peace
officer to cause the removal and seizure of the motor vehicle used in
the contest, in accordance with specified statutory procedures. A
vehicle impounded under these provisions is required to be impounded
for not more than 30 days, with specified exceptions. Existing law
permits the release of the motor vehicle prior to the end of the
impoundment period in specified circumstances. Existing law makes the
registered owner or his or her agent responsible for, among other
things, all towing and storage charges related to the impoundment and
any authorized administrative charges, except under specified
circumstances.
   This bill, the U'Kendra K. Johnson Memorial Act, would extend
those provisions to persons engaged in reckless driving on a highway,
reckless driving in an offstreet parking facility, or an exhibition
of speed on a highway. It would require the impounding agency to
release the vehicle to the registered owner prior to the conclusion
of the impoundment period if the registered owner was neither the
driver nor a passenger in the vehicle at the time of the alleged
violation, or was unaware that the vehicle was being used to engage
in the prohibited activities.
   This bill would declare that it is to take effect immediately as
an urgency statute.


THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:

   23109.2.  (a) (1) Whenever a peace officer determines that a

the vehicle to engage in any of the activities described in
subdivision (a).
   (D) If the legal owner or registered owner of the vehicle is a
rental car agency.
   (E) If, prior to the conclusion of the impoundment period, a
citation or notice is dismissed under Section 40500, criminal charges
are not filed by the district attorney because of a lack of
evidence, or the charges are otherwise dismissed by the court.
   (2) A vehicle shall be released pursuant to this subdivision only
if the registered owner or his or her agent presents a currently

vehicle registration, or if ordered by a court.
   (3) If, pursuant to subparagraph (E) of paragraph (1) a motor
vehicle is released prior to the conclusion of the impoundment
period, neither the person charged with a violation of subdivision
(a) of Section 23109 nor the registered owner of the motor vehicle is
responsible for towing and storage charges nor shall the motor
vehicle be sold to satisfy those charges.
   (d) A vehicle seized and removed under subdivision (a) shall be
released to the legal owner of the vehicle, or the legal owner's

to operate the motor vehicle at the time of the commission of the
offense, the court shall order the convicted person to reimburse the
registered owner for any towing and storage charges related to the
impoundment, and any administrative charges authorized under Section
22850.5 incurred by the registered owner to obtain possession of the
vehicle, unless the court finds that the person convicted does not
have the ability to pay all or part of those charges.
   (3) If the vehicle is a rental vehicle, the rental car agency may
require the person to whom the vehicle was rented to pay all towing
and storage charges related to the impoundment and any administrative
charges authorized under Section 22850.5 incurred by the rental car
agency in connection with obtaining possession of the vehicle.
   (4) The owner is not liable for any towing and storage charges
related to the impoundment if acquittal or dismissal occurs.
   (5) The vehicle may not be sold prior to the defendant's
conviction.

incurred by the towing agency as a result of the impoundment should
the registered owner be absolved of liability for those charges
pursuant to paragraph (3) of subdivision (c). Notwithstanding this
provision, nothing shall prohibit impounding agencies from making
prior payment arrangements to satisfy this requirement.
   (f) Any period when a vehicle is subjected to storage under this
