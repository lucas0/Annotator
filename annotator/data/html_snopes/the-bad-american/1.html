<p><font face="Arial" size="2">This is by Denis Leary and it's the best chain letter I
have ever read!!</font> </p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Hello, my name is Basmati Kasaar.  I am suffering from
rare and deadly diseases, poor scores on final exams, extreme virginity, fear of being
kidnapped and executed by anal electrocution, and guilt for not forwarding out 50 billion
f*cking chain letters sent to me by people who actually believe that if you send them on,
then that poor 6 year old girl in Arkansas with a breast on her forehead will be able to
raise enough money to have it removed before her redneck parents sell her off to the
travelling freak show.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Do you honestly believe that Bill Gates is going to give
you and everyone you send "his" email to $1000?  How stupid are you?
  Ooooh, lookyhere!  If I scroll down this page and make a wish, I'll get laid
by every Playboy/Playgirl model in the magazine!  What a bunch of bullshit. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">So basically, this message is a big F*CK YOU to all the
people out there who have nothing better to do than send me stupid chain mail.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Maybe the evil chain letter leprechauns will come into my
apartment and sodomize me in my sleep for not continuing the chain which was started by
Jesus in 5A.D and was brought to this country by midget pilgrims on the Mayflower and if
it makes it to the year 2000, it'll be in the Guinness Book of World Records for longest
continuous streak of blatant stupidity.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">F*ck them.</font> </p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">If you're going to forward something, at least send me
something mildly amusing.  I've seen all the "send this to 50 of your closest
friends, and this poor, wretched excuse for a human being will somehow receive a nickel
from some omniscient being"  forwards about 90 times.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">I don't f*cking care.  Show a little intelligence and
think about what you're actually contributing to by sending out forwards.  Chances
are it's your own unpopularity.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">THE FOUR BASIC TYPES OF CHAIN LETTERS!!</font> </p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Chain letter type 1:
          (Scroll down)</font> </p>
<p><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Make a wish!!!</font> </p>
<p><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">No, really, go on and make one!!!</font> </p>
<p><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Oh please, they'll never go out with you!!!
   Wish something else!!!</font> </p>
<p><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Not that!!, you pervert!!!</font> </p>
<p><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Is your finger getting tired yet???</font> </p>
<p><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">STOP!!!!</font> </p>
<p><br/>
</p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Wasn't that fun!     Hope you made a
great wish!</font> <br/>
<font face="Arial" size="2">Now, to make you feel guilty, here's what I'll do.</font> <br/>
<font face="Arial" size="2">First of all, if you don't send this to 5096 people in the
next 5 seconds, you will be raped by a mad goat and thrown off a high building into a pile
manure.  It's true!  Because, THIS letter isn't like all of those fake ones,
THIS one is TRUE!!!   REALLY!!!</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Here's how it goes:</font> </p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">*Send this to 1 person:   One person will be
pissed off at you for sending them a stupid chain letter.</font> </p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">*Send this to 2-5 people:   2-5 people will be
pissed off at you for sending them a stupid chain letter.</font> </p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">*Send this to 5-10 people:   5-10 people will be
pissed off at you for sending them a stupid chain letter, and may form a plot on your
life.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">*Send this to 10-20 people:   10-20 people will
be pissed off at you for sending them a stupid chain letter and will firebomb your house.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Thanks!!!!   Good Luck!!!</font> </p>
<p><br/>
</p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Chain letter type 2:</font> </p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Hello, and thank you for reading this letter.  You
see, there is a starving little boy in Baklaliviatatlaglooshen who has no arms, no legs,
no parents, and no goats.  This little boy's life could be saved, because for every
time you pass this on, a dollar will be donated to the Little Starving Legless Armless
Goatless Boy from  Baklaliviatatlaglooshen Fund.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Oh, and remember, we have absolutely no way of counting the
emails sent and this is all a complete load of bullshit.  So go on, reach out.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Send this to 5 people in the next 47 seconds.  Oh, and
a reminder - if you accidentally send this to 4 or 6 people, you will die instantly.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Thanks again!!</font> </p>
<p><br/>
</p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Chain letter type 3:</font> </p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Hi There!!  This chain letter has been in existence
since 1897.  This is absolutely incredible because there was no email then and
probably not as many sad pricks with nothing better to do.  So this is how it works:
Pass this on to 15,067 people in the next 7 minutes or something horrible will happen to
you like:</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Bizarre Horror Story #1</font> <br/>
<font face="Arial" size="2">Miranda Pinsley was walking home from school on Saturday.
  She had received this letter and ignored it.  She then tripped in a crack in
the sidewalk, fell into the sewer, was gushed down a drainpipe in a flood of poopie, and
went flying out over a waterfall.  Not only did she smell nasty, she died.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">THIS COULD HAPPEN TO YOU!!!</font> </p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">BIZARRE STORY #2</font> <br/>
<font face="Arial" size="2">Dexter Bip, a 13 year old boy, got a chain letter in his mail
and ignored it.  Later that day, he was hit by a car, and so was his boyfriend (hey,
some people swing that way).  They both died and went to hell and were cursed to eat
adorable kittens every day for eternity.  THIS COULD HAPPEN TO YOU TOO!!</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Remember you could end up just like Pinsley and Bip.
  Just send this letter to all of your loser friends, and everything will be okay.</font></p>
<p><br/>
</p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Chain letter type 4:</font> </p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">As if you care, here is a poem that I wrote.  Send it
to every one of your friends.</font> </p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The point being???  If you get some chain letter
that's threatening to leave you shagless or luckless for the rest of your life, delete it.
  If it's funny, send it on.  Dont piss people off by making them feel guilty
about a leper in Botswana with no teeth, who's been tied to a dead elephant for 27 years,
whose only saviour is the 5 cents per letter he'll receive if you forward this mail,
otherwise you'll end you like Miranda.   RIGHT???</font></p>
<p><br/>
</p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Now forward this to everyone you know otherwise you'll have
to look at me naked!!!</font> </p>
