<h1 class="tei-head7">U.S.-Soviet Alliance, <span class="tei-date">1941–1945</span>
</h1>
<p class="tei-p2">Although relations between the Soviet Union and the United States had been
                    strained in the years before World War II, the U.S.-Soviet alliance of 1941–1945
                    was marked by a great degree of cooperation and was essential to securing the
                    defeat of Nazi Germany. Without the remarkable efforts of the Soviet Union on
                    the Eastern Front, the United States and Great Britain would have been hard
                    pressed to score a decisive military victory over Nazi Germany.</p>
<div class="tei-figure2">

</div>
<p class="tei-p2">As late as 1939, it seemed highly improbable that the United States and the
                    Soviet Union would forge an alliance. U.S.-Soviet relations had soured
                    significantly following Stalin’s decision to sign a non-aggression pact with
                    Nazi Germany in August of 1939. The Soviet occupation of eastern Poland in
                    September and the “Winter War” against Finland in December led President
                        <span class="tei-persName">Franklin Roosevelt</span> to condemn the Soviet Union publicly
                    as a “dictatorship as absolute as any other dictatorship in the world,” and to
                    impose a “moral embargo” on the export of certain products to the Soviets.
                    Nevertheless, in spite of intense pressure to sever relations with the Soviet
                    Union, Roosevelt never lost sight of the fact that Nazi Germany, not the Soviet
                    Union, posed the greatest threat to world peace. In order to defeat that threat,
                    Roosevelt confided that he “would hold hands with the devil” if necessary.</p>
<p class="tei-p2">Following the Nazi defeat of France in June of 1940, Roosevelt grew wary of the
                    increasing aggression of the Germans and made some diplomatic moves to improve
                    relations with the Soviets. Beginning in July of 1940, a series of negotiations
                    took place in Washington between Under-Secretary of State <a href="https://history.state.gov/departmenthistory/people/welles-benjamin-sumner">
<ref target="/departmenthistory/people/welles-benjamin-sumner">Sumner
                        Welles</ref></a> and Soviet Ambassador Constantine Oumansky. Welles refused to
                    accede to Soviet demands that the United States recognize the changed borders of
                    the Soviet Union after the Soviet seizure of territory in Finland, Poland, and
                    Romania and the reincorporation of the Baltic Republics in August 1940, but the
                    U.S. Government did lift the embargo in January 1941. Furthermore, in March of
                    1941, Welles warned Oumansky of a future Nazi attack against the Soviet Union.
                    Finally, during the Congressional debate concerning the passage of the
                    Lend-Lease bill in early 1941, Roosevelt blocked attempts to exclude the Soviet
                    Union from receiving U.S. assistance.</p>
<div class="tei-figure2">

</div>
<p class="tei-p2">The most important factor in swaying the Soviets eventually to enter into an
                    alliance with the United States was the Nazi decision to launch its invasion of
                    the Soviet Union in June 1941. President Roosevelt responded by dispatching his
                    trusted aide <span class="tei-persName">Harry Lloyd Hopkins</span> to Moscow in order to
                    assess the Soviet military situation. Although the War Department had warned the
                    President that the Soviets would not last more than six weeks, after two
                    one-on-one meetings with Soviet Premier <span class="tei-persName">Josef Stalin</span>,
                    Hopkins urged Roosevelt to assist the Soviets. By the end of October, the first
                        <a href="https://history.state.gov/milestones/1937-1945/lend-lease">
<ref target="/milestones/1937-1945/lend-lease">Lend-Lease aid</ref></a> to the
                    Soviet Union was on its way. The United States entered the war as a belligerent
                    in late 1941 and thus began coordinating directly with the Soviets, and the
                    British, as allies.</p>
<p class="tei-p2">Several issues arose during the war that threatened the alliance. These included
                    the Soviet refusal to aide the Polish Home Army during the Warsaw Uprising of
                    August 1944, and the decision of British and U.S. officials to exclude the
                    Soviets from secret negotiations with German officers in March of 1945 in an
                    effort to secure the surrender of German troops in Italy. The most important
                    disagreement, however, was over the opening of a second front in the West.
                    Stalin’s troops struggled to hold the Eastern front against the Nazi forces, and
                    the Soviets began pleading for a British invasion of France immediately after
                    the Nazi invasion in 1941. In 1942, Roosevelt unwisely promised the Soviets that
                    the Allies would open the second front that autumn. Although Stalin only
                    grumbled when the invasion was postponed until 1943, he exploded the following
                    year when the invasion was postponed again until May of 1944. In retaliation,
                    Stalin recalled his ambassadors from London and Washington and fears soon arose
                    that the Soviets might seek a separate peace with Germany.</p>
<div class="tei-figure2">
<img class="tei-graphic" src="https://static.history.state.gov/milestones/hlhopkins.jpg" title=""/>
<div class="tei-head1">Harry Lloyd Hopkins</div>
</div>
<p class="tei-p2">In spite of these differences, the defeat of Nazi Germany was a joint endeavor
                    that could not have been accomplished without close cooperation and shared
                    sacrifices. Militarily, the Soviets fought valiantly and suffered staggering
                    casualties on the Eastern Front. When Great Britain and the United States
                    finally invaded northern France in 1944, the Allies were finally able to drain
                    Nazi Germany of its strength on two fronts. Finally, two devastating atomic bomb
                    attacks against Japan by the United States, coupled with the Soviets’ decision
                    to break their neutrality pact with Japan by invading Manchuria, finally led to
                    the end of the war in the Pacific.</p>
<p class="tei-p2">Furthermore, during the wartime conferences at Tehran and Yalta, Roosevelt
                    secured political concessions from Stalin and Soviet participation in the United
                    Nations. While President Roosevelt harbored no illusions about Soviet designs in
                    Eastern Europe, it was his great hope that if the United States made a sincere
                    effort to satisfy legitimate Soviet security requirements in Eastern Europe and
                    Northeast Asia, and to integrate the U.S.S.R. into the United Nations, the
                    Soviet regime would become an international team player and moderate its
                    authoritarian regime. Unfortunately, soon after the war, the alliance between
                    the United States and the Soviet Union began to unravel as the two nations faced
                    complex postwar decisions.</p>
