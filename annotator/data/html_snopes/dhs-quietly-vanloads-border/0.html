<p class="subtitle--tiny">Serious Flaws in Border Screening of Fleeing Central Americans </p>
</div>
</article>
</div>
</div>
<blockquote>
<i>I told them, I cried, that I couldn’t go back to

my country… but they deported us.</i>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>—Alicia R., deported from the United States following

Border Patrol screening in August 2014 with her two children, ages 3 and 10,

feared retribution from gang members in Honduras after witnessing the murder of

her mother.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><span>[1]</span></a>
</blockquote>
<p>Migrants from Central America and Mexico seek to enter the

United States without authorization for many reasons. Some seek economic

opportunity. Others are fleeing violent gangs in countries such as Guatemala,

El Salvador, and Honduras, where local officials may be complicit with gangs or

otherwise unable or unwilling to provide meaningful protection. Many have mixed

motives for leaving, including poverty, gang violence, and reuniting with

separated family members.</p>
<p>At the US-Mexico border, US immigration officers issue

deportation orders to unauthorized migrants in accelerated processes known as

“expedited removal” or “reinstatement of removal.”

These processes include rapid-fire screening for a migrant’s fear of

persecution or torture upon return to their home country or an intention to

apply for asylum. As detailed in this report, this cursory screening is failing

to effectively identify people fleeing serious risks to their lives and safety.

</p>
<p>In the past two decades, US laws and policies have become

less responsive to the risks faced by arriving migrants seeking asylum from

persecution. In 1996, and subsequently in 2006, the US government severely

undermined the system for identifying asylum seekers through the establishment

and expansion of expedited removal. The flaws of that approach are readily

apparent today at the US-Mexico border.</p>
<p>This report is based on 35 interviews with Central American

migrants in detention in the US or recently deported to Honduras. While

focusing on the situation facing Hondurans, our findings and recommendations

apply to others coming to the US from Central America and Mexico. </p>
<p>All migrants we interviewed expressed a fear of returning to

Honduras. Some of those who had been returned to Honduras had fear so acute

that they were living in hiding, afraid to go out in public. Several who were

recently deported provided accounts that, if true, should qualify them for

asylum in the US. They said that, prior to attempting to enter the US, they had

been subject to serious threats from gangs in Honduras. These included small

business owners who refused to make demanded payments to gangs; victims of or

witnesses to gang crimes, including murder and rape; and fear of a gang

forcibly recruiting a family’s young son. Others fled abusive domestic

partners or violence related to sexual orientation, both grounds for asylum

under US law. </p>
<p>Virtually all of those we interviewed who had been

apprehended at or near the border were deported summarily, via expedited

removal or reinstatement of removal. Many said they had expressed their fears

to US Border Patrol officials charged with screening for fear of return before

being deported, but fewer than half of these were referred by US Border Patrol

for a further assessment of whether they had a “credible” or

“reasonable” fear of returning to Honduras. US law requires that

when a migrant in expedited or reinstatement of removal expresses a fear of

return to their country of origin, they be referred to a US Citizenship and

Immigration Services (USCIS) asylum officer for an interview to determine

whether their fear might qualify them for asylum or other protection. </p>
<p>Human Rights Watch was unable to corroborate claims about

the specific dangers interviewees said they faced in Honduras. However, the

experiences they described and the fears they expressed should have led US

immigration authorities to give their cases sufficient scrutiny before they

were returned to their home country. The principle of nonrefoulement, the right

not to be returned to a place where one would likely face threats to life or

freedom or other serious harm, recognized under both US and international law,

demands as much.</p>
<p>*    *  

 *</p>
<p>The vast majority of migrants crossing the US-Mexico border

without authorization are placed in detention and undergo a hasty two-part

assessment by US officials under either “expedited removal,” for

first-time border crossers, or “reinstatement of removal,” for

migrants who have previously been deported from the United States. </p>
<p>In either case, to pass the first stage an agent from

Customs and Border Protection (CBP) or another US immigration agency must flag

the person for a “credible fear” or “reasonable fear”

assessment. To pass the second stage, migrants meet with an asylum officer from

USCIS who determines whether their fear of return is “credible,” or

in reinstatement cases, “reasonable” – that is, whether there

is a significant possibility they will prevail in immigration court on their

claim for asylum or protection from deportation to a country where they are

likely to face torture. </p>
<p>While there is evidence that fewer people are passing

through this second stage,<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2"><span>[2]</span></a>

Human Rights Watch’s investigations in Honduras suggests that many asylum

seekers are being turned away in the first stage. The failure of CBP and other

US immigration agencies to identify asylum seekers raises concerns that the US

government is violating its international human rights obligations to examine

asylum claims before returning them to places where their lives or freedom

would be threatened.</p>
<p>Data for 2011 and 2012 that Human Rights Watch obtained from

Customs and Border Protection under the Freedom of Information Act indicate

that few Central American migrants are identified by CBP as people who fear

return to their country in the first stage of the expedited removal process.

The data show that the vast majority of Hondurans, at least 80 percent, are

placed in fast-track expedited removal and reinstatement of removal proceedings

but only a minuscule minority, 1.9 percent, got flagged for credible fear

assessments by CBP. The percentages for Mexico, Honduras, El Salvador, and

Guatemala are similar, ranging from 0.1 to 5.5 percent. By comparison, 21

percent of migrants from other countries who underwent the same proceedings in

the same years were flagged for credible fear interviews by CBP. </p>
<p>CBP has a proactive duty to initially screen migrants for

fear of return to their country of origin when it apprehends them crossing the

border and places them in expedited or reinstatement of removal. However, a

migrant may be identified as fearing return to their country by an immigration

official after they have left CBP custody and entered the custody of

Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), the agency responsible for more

prolonged detention of migrants. ICE, however, does not have a duty to

proactively screen all migrants in its custody for their fear of return. It is

telling, then, that the majority of credible and reasonable fear referrals that

USCIS received in 2011 and 2012 did not come from CBP, but from ICE and other

immigration agencies that learn of migrants’ fear of return on an ad-hoc

basis. In 2012, for example, CBP referred only 615 of the 2,405 Hondurans who

eventually were flagged for credible fear interviews by USCIS.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3"><span>[3]</span></a> Approximately

three-quarters of the credible fear referrals USCIS conducted in 2012 came from

agencies other than the CBP, even though that year CBP was responsible for

approximately 57 percent of all noncitizen apprehensions.</p>
<p>Migrants who feared returning to Honduras told Human Rights

Watch about problems they encountered at all stages of the summary removal

process: some said that US border officials ignored their expressions of fear

and removed them with no opportunity to have their claims examined; others said

border officials acknowledged hearing their expressions of fear but pressured

them to abandon their claims. For those who were referred for “credible

fear” interviews, some said they were intimidated and confused by the

interview process and complex immigration court asylum proceedings that they

had to navigate on their own while detained and without legal assistance.</p>
<p>When immigration officials place potential asylum seekers

from Honduras and other Central American countries in summary removal without

putting them into the “credible fear” process, the migrants have no

opportunity to have an asylum officer or immigration judge consider their case.

US immigration courts are badly backlogged, but many migrants apprehended in

the interior of the country – and thus not subject to Customs and Border

Protection custody – are able to present their defenses against removal

from the United States, including any claims to asylum, before a decision-maker

who can make a more thorough examination of their claims. </p>
<p>Things are different at the border. Research by Human Rights

Watch and others show that the CBP’s methods for interviewing migrants in

expedited removal procedures are seriously flawed. Unlike “credible or

reasonable fear” assessments, which usually last over 45 minutes and take

place at least 48 hours after a migrant is in ICE custody, Border Patrol

screening interviews occur in Border Patrol stations and are much shorter.

Uniformed CBP officers are usually armed while apprehending migrants; when they

interview the migrants a few hours or days later their holsters are empty but

visible; they often conduct interviews in crowded settings, without

confidentiality from family members or others. All of these factors appear to

hamper the ability of officers to identify those in need of more in-depth

screening. The migrants we interviewed said that the CBP officers whom they

encountered seemed singularly focused on removing them from the United States,

which impeded their ability to make their fears known. </p>
<p>One man who was deported in September 2014 told Human Rights

Watch that when he informed a Border Patrol officer of the threats to his life

in Honduras, “He told me there was nothing I could do and I didn’t

have a case so there was no reason to dispute the deportation…. I told

him he was violating my right to life and he said, ‘You don’t have

rights here.’” </p>
<p>Arriving migrants in expedited removal or reinstatement of

removal are subject to mandatory detention under US law. In recent years, this

has meant US immigration officials have exercised their discretion not to use

these accelerated procedures for most arriving families with children, which

would mean they would be mandatorily detained, opting instead to place families

in removal proceedings before immigration judges. In 2009, facing lawsuits and

under pressure from rights organizations, the Obama administration ended family

detention at the T. Don Hutto Detention Center, which had 490 beds for the

detention of migrant families with children. Since it was one of two migrant

facilities in the country equipped to detain families with children (the other,

in Berks, Pennsylvania, has 85 beds), this decision indicated an intention to

drastically reduce the practice of detaining families. </p>
<p>Since that time, however, the US government has reversed its

plans. In June 2014, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) established two

detention facilities in Artesia, New Mexico, and Karnes, Texas, with between

500 and 700 beds each to hold arriving families. In September 2014, DHS announced

plans to contract with a private prison company, the Corrections Corporation of

America, to build a 2,400-bed family detention facility in Dilley, Texas. The

facilities now in operation have been used to detain families primarily from

Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador who are in the process of expedited

removal. </p>
<p>International law prohibits the detention of migrant

children and discourages the detention of asylum seekers. Detention interferes

with individuals’ ability to assert claims to asylum, access counsel, and

harms the physical and mental health of children as they struggle with life

behind bars and the uncertainties of indefinite detention. These policies also

contravene international standards against the use of immigration detention to

deter asylum seekers.</p>
<p>Human Rights Watch urges the Obama administration and the

Congress to immediately address US border policies that are risking the lives

of Central American migrants. They should cease fast-tracking Central American

migrants for deportation to ensure migrants have an adequate opportunity to

make a claim for asylum. If fast-tracking continues, the US should take

immediate measures to ensure all migrants who express fear are being flagged

for further screening. The administration should also reverse its decision to

expand the detention of migrant families, evidenced by the creation of two new

family detention facilities in June and July and plans announced in September

to build a 2,400-bed facility in Dilley, Texas. Finally, the government should

increase migrants’ access to legal counsel, which would improve handling

of asylum claims and better ensure the US does not return people to countries

where they face persecution or torture.</p><a class="link--top" href="#page">Back to top</a></section>

<span>Methodology</span>
<a name="7977a7"></a>
</h1>
<p>This report is based largely on interviews conducted by

Human Rights Watch from September 4 to 12, 2014 in three cities in

Honduras—San Pedro Sula, Comayagua, and Tegucigalpa—as well as

interviews in July and September 2014 in family detention facilities in

Artesia, New Mexico, and Karnes, Texas. We also interviewed officials at Border

Patrol facilities in McAllen, Texas in July 2014. Human Rights Watch

interviewed 25 Hondurans who were recently deported from the United States, 10

Central American detainees in family detention centers, and one in an adult

detention center in the United States. We also interviewed migrant services

providers, lawyers, academics, and government officials in Honduras and in the

United States. </p>
<p>Human Rights Watch carried out interviews in English or in

Spanish, depending on the preference of the interviewee, without interpreters.

We informed the interviewees of the purpose of our research and did not pay

them or offer them other incentives to speak with us. In some cases in the

report, we have used pseudonyms and withheld other identifying information to

protect interviewees and their families from possible retaliation. </p>
<p>The report also contains quantitative analysis of data

acquired from CBP via US Freedom of Information Act requests. The data contains

information on all CBP apprehensions through fiscal years 2011 and 2012 (more

than 683,000 apprehensions). Analysis is focused on descriptive statistics of

the nationality and disposition variables.</p><a class="link--top" href="#page">Back to top</a></section>

<span></span>
<span>I. Background on Threats in

Honduras</span>
<a name="e42380"></a>
</h1>
<p>Honduras suffers from rampant crime and impunity for human

rights abuses. The murder rate, which has risen consistently over the last

decade, was the highest in the world in 2013.<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4"><span>[4]</span></a>For young adult males between the ages of 20 and 34, the murder rate in

Honduras exceeds 300 per 100,000.<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5"><span>[5]</span></a></p>
<p>Violence in Honduras is largely the result of conflict over

control of drug trafficking routes and turf wars between criminal groups,<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6"><span>[6]</span></a> although,

as in many other countries, these groups target other people in their

communities as well. Local street gangs, the key drivers of violence, are

primarily affiliated with transnational gangs such as the Mara Salvatrucha (or

MS-13) or Barrio 18 (also known as Calle 18, La 18 or Mara-18).<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7"><span>[7]</span></a> Both groups exert

influence over entire neighborhoods, profiting economically by levying an <i>impuesto

de guerra</i> or “war tax” on residents and local business people.<a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8"><span>[8]</span></a> Failure to

pay this “tax” can result in violent retaliation by gangs.<a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9"><span>[9]</span></a></p>
<p>Witnesses to gang-related crimes in Honduras fear

retaliatory violence, whether or not they speak out about what they have seen.<a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10"><span>[10]</span></a>

“Here in Honduras, you can’t make a complaint, because then the

gang comes and finishes your family,” said one man who survived a

near-fatal attack by a gang member.<a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11"><span>[11]</span></a></p>
<p>Gang death threats may follow a person wherever they go

within the country. As Central American gang expert Thomas Boerman puts it,

“if you go to a new community everyone recognizes you as a stranger

including the police officers and the gang members. It takes only a little bit

of time for anyone looking for you to find you.”<a href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12"><span>[12]</span></a></p>
<p>Young people are often targeted by gangs for recruitment and

to carry out crime.<a href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13"><span>[13]</span></a>

Gangs typically recruit poor, homeless, or marginalized youth, sometimes

putting them through initiation rituals involving violent acts. Membership is

seen as a life-long commitment and desertion is severely punished. One father,

speaking of his 10-year-old son, told Human Rights Watch, “I’m

scared for him. They already start making them do things at 10.”<a href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14"><span>[14]</span></a></p>
<p>Girls may also be targeted by gangs for forced recruitment

or sexual harassment and abuse.<a href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15"><span>[15]</span></a>

Cecilia N., a 14-year-old girl who was deported from the US with her mother,

said, “I’m terrified because they have taken girls from my school

and raped them.”<a href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16"><span>[16]</span></a>

After her visit to Honduras in July 2014, the United Nations special rapporteur

on violence against women noted that violent deaths among women had increased

by 263 percent between 2005 and 2013 and that reports indicated a 95 percent

rate of impunity for femicide and sexual violence crimes.<a href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17"><span>[17]</span></a></p>
<p>Bias-motivated attacks on lesbian, gay, bisexual,

transgender, and intersex (LGBTI) people are also a serious problem. The

alleged involvement of Honduran police in some of these violent crimes is of

particular concern. In 2011 and 2012, the government established special

prosecutors’ units to investigate these crimes, yet there is no evidence

that these efforts have resulted in a significant increase in prosecutions.<a href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18"><span>[18]</span></a></p>
<p>Perpetrators of killings and other violent crimes in

Honduras are rarely brought to justice. The institutions responsible for

providing public security continue to be largely effectual and are marred by

corruption and abuse, while efforts to reform them have made little progress.<a href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19"><span>[19]</span></a> Criminal

groups have reportedly deeply penetrated the Honduran national police,

demanding bribes and passing information to criminal groups.<a href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20"><span>[20]</span></a></p><a class="link--top" href="#page">Back to top</a></section>

<span>II. First-Hand Accounts: Threats Facing Returned Hondurans</span>
<a name="e53a09"></a>
</h1>
<p>Hondurans interviewed by Human Rights Watch who had been

recently deported from the United States said they were subject to specific

threats that, if true, would make them eligible for asylum in the United

States. Many described threats from gangs in Honduras. Some of these threats

arose from the common practice of gangs demanding extortion payments from small

business owners. Others were victims or witnesses to crimes such as murder and

rape and targeted on that basis. One said that he feared the forced recruitment

of his young son into a gang. Others faced dangers from other sources,

including abusive domestic partners. Nearly all said they had no meaningful

protection from such violence in Honduras. </p>
<p>Some said their fear was so acute that they were afraid to

go out in public after they were deported to Honduras.<a href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21"><span>[21]</span></a> One 27-year-old man

told Human Rights Watch he could not leave his sister’s house nor tell

his four young children that he was back in the country for fear of being found

by gangs. He described leaving the house only rarely and, even then, only when

wearing a motorcycle helmet with a darkened visor.<a href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22"><span>[22]</span></a> A deported woman described

moving from house to house among her relatives every few days for fear of

retaliation by the gang that she had witnessed murder her mother.<a href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23"><span>[23]</span></a>Almost

everyone suffering these kinds of threats told Human Rights Watch that they

planned to try to flee the country again as soon as possible. </p>
<p>Mateo S., who was deported from the United States to

Honduras on September 9, 2014, told Human Rights Watch: </p>
<blockquote>It’s run by a gang where I live. I can’t say

the name, because it wouldn’t be safe, but they are in charge…. I

had my own business here in my city. I sold bleach and other cleaning supplies

from house to house. At some point, the gang started to ask me for money. Here,

they call it a “war tax.” Eventually, they were asking me for about

US$300 dollars a month, which is the same thing here as the minimum wage. It

was impossible for me. They saw that I couldn’t pay this money so they

started to mess with my family, with my son, who is seven years old, and with

my wife. Eventually, they were threatening me all the time. I was paying them

money for six to eight months, every month. And then I couldn’t pay it

anymore and my business went bankrupt and then I was using our savings to pay

the gang members. I had to pay because I was afraid they would do something to

my family. </blockquote>
<blockquote>Then they tried to kidnap my son in June 2014. I usually

come early to school to pick up my son at lunchtime. They got there maybe 10 or

20 minutes before the kids come out. I recognized them. They had already told

me that something was going to happen to my son and to my wife. I didn’t

hesitate. I jumped the school fence with my son. I pushed him over and then I

jumped. Later in the day, the teachers told me that [the gang members] were

looking for a kid of my son’s age. I didn’t send him back to school.…

We had some savings from three or four years so I sent my son and my wife to

the United States. Once I knew they were safe, I fled too.<a href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24"><span>[24]</span></a><i></i>
</blockquote>
<p>Mercedes R. also felt threatened because of her inability to

pay “taxes” to the gangs in Honduras. She said, “I was facing

threats from the gangs because I had a store that sold food. Starting in 2013,

I spent a year paying them dollars and then I couldn’t anymore. I felt

like I wasn’t living anymore. I mistrusted everyone. I didn’t feel

safe.”<a href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25"><span>[25]</span></a></p>
<p>People who witness murders or other crimes committed by

gangs often fear for their lives. Roberto L., who was deported from the United

States to Honduras in September 2014, said:</p>
<blockquote>They killed my mother right in front of me. She had a small

clothing shop. I was shot at the same time. This was in September 2013. I have

been fleeing since, because I know they are looking for me. I have two kids

here but I can’t see them because that would put them in danger. They

can’t know I’m here. The assassins who are looking for me are at a

national level, they will find me anywhere. I’m just going to be here for

three weeks, then I’ll try again.<a href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26"><span>[26]</span></a>
</blockquote>
<p>Alicia R. explained that her witnessing her mother’s

murder put her at risk from gang members: </p>
<blockquote>They took my mother’s life.… The day that she

died I was going to pick her up because she had some money to give me. I got

there and then the criminals who killed her arrived. I witnessed everything

that happened.… They were coming to kill somebody who was there and she

was there too. She didn’t have any problems. The issue is that I saw it

and they saw me. They were supposedly from a gang called “18” here.

The people from the gangs don’t have any heart, whether with adults,

children. They don’t have hearts.</blockquote>
<blockquote>We buried my mother … and then I had to leave the

house we lived in because they came to look for us. I left everything. I went

to my mother in law’s house and then an aunt’s house. I keep moving

between these places for protection because when you get to one place or

another, they find out quickly. They check. So as not to be in danger I always

move, so that I’m never in the same place …I

can’t rest. I can’t even work here. I’ve always lived here

but now I have to stay on the move from place to place to protect myself from

them and to protect the lives of my children. I don’t have any peace. I

don’t want to be in this country because my life is in danger.<a href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27"><span>[27]</span></a>
</blockquote>
<p>Jacobo E., who was deported from the United States to

Honduras in August 2014, said he was living in fear for his life. He told Human

Rights Watch, </p>
<blockquote>I’ve always worked. I’ve never been in a gang.

I was baptized as a Mormon in 1994 and I have four kids with my wife. I had to

flee though because my wife started an affair with a guy from “18.”

… I saw the guy leaving my house one day and we had a fight. Then they

told my sister that the gang was going to kill me, so I fled. Now that

I’m back here again I don’t go out. I can’t. My parents are

supporting me and I live with my sister…. I put on a motorcycle helmet

inside the house to come here. </blockquote>
<blockquote>I can’t work. If I look for work they’ll see

me. They are in charge in many places, the “18” is nearly

everywhere. Being locked up like this is ugly. I think about my children all

the time. I can’t contact them or tell them that I’m back in the

country though. That would be dangerous. </blockquote>
<p>The pervasive nature of gang violence in Honduras places

random individuals under threat. Marlon J., who was deported from the United

States to Honduras in August 2014, said, </p>
<blockquote>I was a door-to-door salesman in a neighborhood called La

Canada. One day I was passing by a corner with three guys just standing there.

I wasn’t afraid because I usually walked around there. But then one of

them ran at me and shot me seven times in the back. They left me for dead …

I spent two months in the hospital and it took seven months to be able to walk.

</blockquote>
<blockquote>When I came back to work one of my clients told me the gang

was after me because that guy was going through a test. He had to kill the

first person who walked by, to show he was brave. He would have to kill me now

since I was supposed to be dead. I went to another part of the city, but then

my brother-in-law was killed for not paying the “war tax.” That

made me even more afraid. </blockquote>
<blockquote>I’m a father of two kids, two and five years old. I

have a lot to live for. When they deported me from the United States they said

they would put me in prison for six months if I come back. It doesn’t

matter to me if I get six months, at least in Port Isabel [detention center in

Texas], it’s safe. What I want is to be out of here.<a href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28"><span>[28]</span></a>
</blockquote>
<p>Returned migrants to Honduras did not feel the Honduran

authorities were able or willing to protect them. As Marlon J., put it, after

receiving seven gunshot wounds at the hands of a gang initiate, “Here in

Honduras, you can’t file a police complaint because after that the gang

comes and finishes your family. Delinquency is what governs.”<a href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29"><span>[29]</span></a></p>
<p>Alicia R., who witnessed her mother’s murder, also

felt she could not seek protection from Honduran police:</p>
<blockquote>I never filed a complaint because sometimes in this country

there is a lot of corruption.… Sometimes the police work together with

the criminals.… If you go do something like that [lodge a complaint]

sometimes that means they are going to be waiting for you outside of the police

station.<a href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30"><span>[30]</span></a>

<span></span>
<span>III. Expedited Removal,

Reinstatement of Removal, and Screening for Credible Fear</span>
<a name="351224"></a>
</h1>
<p>The Universal Declaration of Human Rights provides that

“[e]veryone has the right to seek and to enjoy in other countries asylum

from persecution.”<a href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31"><span>[31]</span></a>

In the past two decades, US laws and practices have increasingly narrowed that

right.</p>
<p>In 1996, as part of the Illegal Immigration Reform and

Immigrant Responsibility Act (IIRIRA), the US Congress enacted a new provision

called “expedited removal.” It allows the summary expulsion of

noncitizens who have not been admitted or paroled into the US, who have been in

the US for less than two years, and who present fraudulent documents or have no

documents. Unless they express a fear of persecution or torture upon return to

their home countries or indicate an intention to apply for asylum, they may be

deported immediately and will be barred from returning to the US for at least

five years, and often much longer.<a href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32"><span>[32]</span></a></p>
<p>Initially, the US government applied expedited removal

provisions only to noncitizens arriving at official entry points along the

border or at airports known as “ports of entry.” Over the last

decade, however, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), which was

established in 2002 after the September 11, 2001 attacks on the United States,

has applied expedited removal procedures to people apprehended along the entire

US border. Under DHS regulations this includes people apprehended within 100

miles of the border.<a href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33"><span>[33]</span></a></p>
<p>For asylum seekers—those in need of protection from

forced return—the IIRIRA created another hurdle, called reinstatement of

removal. If an individual is removed or voluntarily leaves under an order of

removal, and subsequently reenters the United States illegally, they face the

reinstatement of the previous order.<a href="#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34"><span>[34]</span></a>

A border crosser whose order has been reinstated is barred from applying for

asylum but may access other remedies such as withholding of removal or

protection from return to torture under the Convention against Torture and

Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (“Convention

against Torture”), to which the US is a party.<a href="#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35"><span>[35]</span></a></p>
<p>Many individuals crossing the border first discuss their

cases with a Customs and Border Protection agent who, under US law, is supposed

to inform them that they may ask for protection if they have a fear of

returning home. If a fear of return is expressed, the agent should flag them

for a more thorough assessment known as a “credible fear”

interview.<a href="#_ftn36" name="_ftnref36"><span>[36]</span></a>

Research by Human Rights Watch and others show that the CBP’s methods for

interviewing migrants in expedited removal procedures are seriously flawed.<a href="#_ftn37" name="_ftnref37"><span>[37]</span></a></p>
<p>A primary finding of Human Rights Watch’s

investigation in Honduras is that individuals seeking asylum are not being

flagged for credible fear interviews by CBP officers. This is supported by US

government data. Between October 2010 and September 2012, the vast majority of

Hondurans, 81 percent, were placed in the fast-track expedited removal and

reinstatement of removal proceedings; only a miniscule minority, 1.9 percent,

were flagged for credible fear assessments by CBP.<a href="#_ftn38" name="_ftnref38"><span>[38]</span></a></p>
<p>The data also show low rates of credible fear referrals by

CBP for nationals of Mexico, El Salvador, and Guatemala. Only 0.1 percent of

Mexicans, 0.8 percent of Guatemalans, and 5.5 percent of Salvadorans in

expedited or reinstatement of removal were referred to a credible or reasonable

fear interview by CBP. However, 21 percent of migrants from countries other

than these, who underwent the same proceedings in the same years, were flagged

for credible fear interviews by CBP. On October 9, 2014, Human Rights Watch

requested updated apprehension data from CBP, which could shed light on the

trends in CBP credible fear referral rates during the 2013 and 2014 influx of

migrant adults, families and children from Central America. </p>

</figure>
<p></p>
<p>As discussed above, those unauthorized migrants who are

flagged for having a fear of return, proceed to a pre-asylum screening to

determine whether there is a significant possibility that they can establish

persecution or fear of persecution before an immigration judge.<a href="#_ftn39" name="_ftnref39"><span>[39]</span></a></p>
<p>In recent years, migrants from Honduras, Guatemala, and El

Salvador have formed an increasing proportion of the credible fear referrals

received by USCIS.<a href="#_ftn40" name="_ftnref40"><span>[40]</span></a>

Absolute numbers of Central Americans identified for credible or reasonable

fear screening have also been increasing. Referrals of Hondurans, for instance,

have increased from 1,108 individuals in 2006 to 8,539 in 2013.<a href="#_ftn41" name="_ftnref41"><span>[41]</span></a></p>
<p>Most of these referrals, however, do not come from CBP,

despite CBP’s proactive duty to screen migrants it places in expedited or

reinstatement of removal for fear of return to their country of origin. In

2012, for example, CBP referred only 615 of the 2,405 Hondurans who eventually

received credible fear interviews.<a href="#_ftn42" name="_ftnref42"><span>[42]</span></a>

Approximately three-quarters of the credible fear referrals USCIS conducted in

2012 came from agencies other than the CBP, even though that year CBP was

responsible for approximately 57 percent of all noncitizen apprehensions.<a href="#_ftn43" name="_ftnref43"><span>[43]</span></a></p>
<p>A migrant may be referred by an immigration official after they

have left CBP custody and entered the custody of Immigrations and Customs

Enforcement (ICE), the agency responsible for more prolonged detention of

migrants. ICE, however, does not have a duty to proactively screen all migrants

in its custody for their fear of return. The majority of credible and

reasonable fear referrals that USCIS received in 2011 and 2012 did not come

from CBP but other immigration agencies, which learn of migrants’ fear of

return on an ad-hoc basis. </p>
<p>For those who are referred to credible fear interviews, the

likelihood of being permitted to apply for asylum appears to have fallen

significantly in recent months. This comes in the wake of problematic new

guidance for asylum officers conducting interviews (referred to as the “lesson

plan”) issued in February 2014.<a href="#_ftn44" name="_ftnref44"><span>[44]</span></a>

Before the lesson plan was enacted, in January 2014, 83 percent of those who

received credible fear interviews were permitted to apply for asylum. In July

2014, six months later, that figure was 63 percent.<a href="#_ftn45" name="_ftnref45"><span>[45]</span></a> While this could be an

artifact of a larger number of credible fear referrals or a smaller sample size

of the months since the plan, this evidence suggests that the lesson plan has

reduced the proportion of interviews in which credible fear is found. The

precipitous apparent decline occurred in the period after the release of the

new lesson plan, and not in tandem with the rise in referrals. Asylum law

experts have criticized the lesson plan for inappropriately raising the burden

of proof required at the credible or reasonable fear stage.<a href="#_ftn46" name="_ftnref46"><span>[46]</span></a></p>
<p>If a noncitizen is found to have a credible fear, they may

then apply for asylum as a defense against deportation in immigration court.

Though the asylum seeker will be able to go before a judge to make their claim

for protection, they have no right to a government-appointed lawyer to assist

them. ICE may detain noncitizens going through these immigration court

procedures for the duration of the deportation process on a discretionary

basis, though some become eligible for release on bond or on their own

recognizance once they are transferred to immigration court. </p><a class="link--top" href="#page">Back to top</a></section>

<span><span></span><b><span>‎</span></b>IV.

First-Hand Accounts: Asylum Seekers’ Experiences in Expedited Removal</span>
<a name="2c89e9"></a>
</h1>
<p>US Customs and Border Protection officers are required to

screen people in expedited removal for fear of return to their country and, if

the noncitizen expresses fear, refer them for a credible fear interview.<a href="#_ftn47" name="_ftnref47"><span>[47]</span></a> Despite

this requirement, Human Rights Watch spoke with deportees who reported that

they were not informed of the availability of protection or that they were not

referred to an asylum officer for a credible fear interview after they told a

Border Patrol agent they were afraid to return to their country.<a href="#_ftn48" name="_ftnref48"><span>[48]</span></a> Some

would-be asylum seekers also reported that Border Patrol officers harassed,

threatened, and attempted to dissuade them from applying for asylum. </p>
<p>Additionally, CBP officers conduct interviews about fear of

return in a sometimes crowded and public enforcement setting and without

confidentiality from family members or others, factors that appear to hamper

the ability of the officers to identify those in need of more in-depth

screening. Human Rights Watch observed the interview location for detainees at

the McAllen Border Patrol station in Texas in July 2014. CBP officers showed

Human Rights Watch a large public space in which they process migrants at a

horseshoe-shaped table designed to accommodate multiple officer-migrant pairs

in close proximity. Holding cells ring the room, with concrete floors and walls

and toilets behind half-high barriers. CBP officers told and demonstrated to

Human Rights Watch how they check their weapons before entering, but wear their

uniform with holsters – which can be particularly intimidating to persons

fearful of the security forces in their home countries.<a href="#_ftn49" name="_ftnref49"><span>[49]</span></a> CBP officers told

Human Rights Watch that the McAllen Border Patrol station was physically

similar to many other such stations along the Mexican border.</p>
<p>Migrants who were not referred for a credible fear interview

told Human Rights Watch that interviews by CBP are brief and focused on

explaining additional consequences of deportation, such as bars to return for

set periods of time, rather than exploring their fear of return. “The

officers don’t pay attention to you. If you say you are afraid they say

they ‘can’t do anything,” Marlon J. told Human Rights Watch.

“All they said to me was that if I came back they would give me six

months in prison.”<a href="#_ftn50" name="_ftnref50"><span>[50]</span></a></p>
<p>Some Border Patrol officers apparently tried to convince

border crossers not to apply for asylum. “I asked for asylum,” said

Jacobo E., who fled after being shot and seeing his mother killed for her

failure to pay fees to gang members to run her small clothing business.

“The officer told me don’t apply, 90 percent of the people who do

don’t get it.”<a href="#_ftn51" name="_ftnref51"><span>[51]</span></a>

Some deportees and detainees with whom we spoke reported that they resisted

signing forms offered by Border Patrol, or were coerced into signing something

they did not understand. “‘Fingerprint, fingerprint,’ they

just kept saying, I didn’t know what I was signing,” said Jacobo E.

who was in hiding in Honduras after being deported.<a href="#_ftn52" name="_ftnref52"><span>[52]</span></a> Maribel V., who was

deported from the Artesia, New Mexico family detention center with her children,

said: </p>
<blockquote>They made me sign the deportation in the

“icebox” [slang for the cold Border Patrol detention cells]. No

judge or lawyer spoke with me. They called me and they said that I had to sign

this paper. They told me that it was for a judge to see my case. But I never

saw a judge and they told me I had a deportation order. They told me I was

already deported.<a href="#_ftn53" name="_ftnref53"><span>[53]</span></a>
</blockquote>
<p>Mateo S., who had fled death threats from a gang, said he

tried to not sign papers agreeing to his deportation: </p>
<blockquote>I was detained for six days in the cold rooms. They just

asked me my name, where I came from, and they told me I was punished for five

years and I had to sign the deportation. I didn’t want to sign. When the

moment of the interview came I said I wouldn’t sign. The officer insulted

me. They started waking me up every couple of hours and moving me from cell to

cell. It was hard…. The officer filled out all the paperwork and told me

to sign, I told him I wouldn’t sign and I hoped the US government would

admit me. He ripped up all the paper and threw it almost at my face. He told me

I was deported anyway. He said he “had the law in his hand and he was

going to sign for me.” I told him he was violating my right to life and

he said, “You don’t have rights here.”<a href="#_ftn54" name="_ftnref54"><span>[54]</span></a>
</blockquote>
<p>Alicia R., an asylum seeker who crossed the border with her

two children, 3 and 10 years old, told officers of her fear of returning to

Honduras. In an attempt at self-preservation, thinking it would keep her from

being deported to Honduras, she also told them she was from Mexico: </p>
<blockquote>The truth is because I didn’t want to come back

here [to Honduras], I told them that I was from Mexico. I told them, I

cried, I said I couldn’t return to my country. Sometimes

you are so afraid … to be sent back so you just say something.<a href="#_ftn55" name="_ftnref55"><span>[55]</span></a>
</blockquote>
<p>After two days, US officials turned Alicia and her children

over to the Mexican government, which deported them two weeks later back to

Honduras.<a href="#_ftn56" name="_ftnref56"><span>[56]</span></a></p>
<p>Some migrants told Human Rights Watch that when they tried

to tell US officials about their fear of returning, they were denied further

exploration of that claim, and were put in touch with consular officers from their

country of origin. This practice runs counter to international protection

standards, which recognize the problematic relationship asylum seekers may have

with officials from their home countries. “The [US] officers don’t

speak with you. They just set it up so you can speak with a consular officer

and then so you sign the papers,” said Marlon J.<a href="#_ftn57" name="_ftnref57"><span>[57]</span></a></p>
<p>In some cases, migrants reported that consular officers

dissuaded them from making international protection claims. Mateo S. explained,

</p>
<blockquote>They put me in touch with someone who they said was the

consul of Honduras on a video screen. I explained to him in total confidence

that I was fleeing my country and the threats I was facing. He told me I

didn’t have a case, so why try?<a href="#_ftn58" name="_ftnref58"><span>[58]</span></a>

<span></span>
<span>V. Detention and Access

to Counsel</span>
<a name="e27012"></a>
</h1>
<p>None of the asylum seekers Human Rights Watch met with who

had been deported to Honduras had had lawyers while in the United States,

though several had tried to obtain them. While many asylum seekers without

financial resources have difficulty obtaining legal counsel in the US, it is

particularly difficult for those who are placed in detention facilities near

the border and put in expedited proceedings.</p>
<p>Detention of noncitizens in expedited removal proceedings

and reinstatement of removal is mandatory under US law.<a href="#_ftn59" name="_ftnref59"><span>[59]</span></a> Because nearly all

arriving Central Americans without authorization are placed in expedited

removal proceedings, the vast majority are also detained prior to deportation. </p>
<p>Detention adds to the burdens and fears asylum seekers face.

The fact that it is administrative rather than criminal detention may be of

little practical consequence. Several told Human Rights Watch how being

detained weighed on them. “I didn’t have any idea what a prison

was,” said Jacobo E. “They just treated me like a criminal.”<a href="#_ftn60" name="_ftnref60"><span>[60]</span></a></p>
<p>Detention also makes it more difficult for asylum seekers to

gather evidence that might be useful in their cases. Roberto L. was detained

for six months while he attempted to apply for asylum on the basis of threats

and past harm. “They said I needed proof,” he said. “But they

said you have to be detained for [an additional] six months [to keep applying

for asylum], so I signed the deportation.”<a href="#_ftn61" name="_ftnref61"><span>[61]</span></a></p>
<p>Detainees also face considerable obstacles in obtaining

legal counsel, a challenge made more difficult when they are held in detention

facilities. “I need to find a lawyer but it seems impossible,” one

woman from Honduras then detained in Artesia, New Mexico told Human Rights

Watch. “I will die if I am sent back to my country.”<a href="#_ftn62" name="_ftnref62"><span>[62]</span></a> Maria F.

was deported in September after being detained at Karnes family detention

center with her 8-year-old daughter. “They give you a paper with [the

names of] free lawyers. But nobody answers when you call.”<a href="#_ftn63" name="_ftnref63"><span>[63]</span></a></p>
<p>One legal service provider in San Francisco agreed that

detained migrants had difficulty locating legal counsel: </p>
<blockquote>We get many calls from people whose family members are in

detention, including in Texas. Usually we get the call after they’ve

called multiple other organizations or lawyers. The few legal service providers

who have called them back charge very high fees. There’s just a very high

demand and not enough supply. We never get initial calls from detainees

themselves. They need to have someone on the outside who can help them find a

lawyer and even then it’s very difficult.<a href="#_ftn64" name="_ftnref64"><span>[64]</span></a>
</blockquote>
<p>In 2005, the United States Commission on International

Religious Freedom (USCIRF), a government agency, found that the expedited

removal process lacks adequate safeguards to prevent improper removal and

extended detention of bona fide refugees in the United States.<a href="#_ftn65" name="_ftnref65"><span>[65]</span></a> USCIRF’s

analysis also found that asylum seekers in expedited removal who are

represented by an attorney were granted relief 25 percent of the time, while

asylum seekers who were representing themselves were granted relief 2 percent

of the time.<a href="#_ftn66" name="_ftnref66"><span>[66]</span></a>

Robert A. Katzmann, a judge of the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit,

summed up the results of a two-year study on immigrant representation in New

York: “The two most important variables affecting the ability to secure a

successful outcome in a case (defined as relief or termination) are having

representation and being free from detention.”<a href="#_ftn67" name="_ftnref67"><span>[67]</span></a></p>
<p>Human Rights Watch has previously documented how detaining

noncitizens, sometimes far from family members and friends, affects their

access to counsel.<a href="#_ftn68" name="_ftnref68"><span>[68]</span></a>

The Executive Office for Immigration Review recently reported that the

percentage of represented cases in immigration court has increased in the past

five years from 35 percent in 2009 to 59 percent in 2014.<a href="#_ftn69" name="_ftnref69"><span>[69]</span></a> Yet there is a large

gap between representation rates for detained versus non-detained immigrants in

immigration court proceedings. The New York Immigrant Representation Study

found in 2011 that 40 percent of detained immigrants and 73 percent of

non-detained immigrants in the New York City area had lawyers.<a href="#_ftn70" name="_ftnref70"><span>[70]</span></a></p>
<p>Things are even worse for migrants detained in south Texas,

like most of those interviewed for this report. Texas Appleseed, a non-profit

legal services organization, found 86 percent of immigration detainees in Texas

were unrepresented in 2009.<a href="#_ftn71" name="_ftnref71"><span>[71]</span></a>

Several more recent reports indicate that systematic problems with

detainees’ access to counsel have not been resolved.<a href="#_ftn72" name="_ftnref72"><span>[72]</span></a> The American

Immigration Council and Penn State Law found in 2012 that,</p>
<blockquote>ICE fails to provide or facilitate access to counsel when

questioning represented individuals, restricts attorney-client communications

in detention facilities, and has also discouraged noncitizens from seeking

legal counsel.<a href="#_ftn73" name="_ftnref73"><span>[73]</span></a>
</blockquote>
<p>Dani A., one of the few individuals interviewed by Human

Rights Watch who had passed the credible fear interview stage, ended up

deported to Honduras apparently due to her inability to secure counsel while in

detention. At 21, Dani had been in an abusive relationship for four years in

which her husband regularly beat her and kicked her. Two years ago, her

husband’s cousin ambushed her in a deserted part of town and raped her.

She went to the police to report the rape, but “nothing was

resolved.”<a href="#_ftn74" name="_ftnref74"><span>[74]</span></a>

Not knowing she had made a complaint, the cousin told her that if she told

anyone about the attack he would kill her. She feared the cousin would harm her

again and that her husband would seek her out and harm her. </p>
<p>After entering the United States and being identified by CBP

for further screening, Dani spoke with an asylum officer who found that there

was “a significant possibility” she could establish in a full

hearing that she would qualify for refugee status.<a href="#_ftn75" name="_ftnref75"><span>[75]</span></a> A recent decision by

the Board of Immigration Appeals recognizes domestic violence as a basis for

asylum, establishing a formally binding precedent upholding earlier immigration

court rulings.<a href="#_ftn76" name="_ftnref76"><span>[76]</span></a></p>
<p>Detained in Houston, Texas, with only three years of formal

schooling and no money to pay a lawyer, Dani tried to move forward with her

asylum claim. Gender-based asylum claims, including those related to domestic

violence like Dani experienced, are particularly legally complex. Officials

gave her a list of free legal services providers in the area but she said,

“They never answered my calls.” With the help of other detainees

who spoke more English, she filled out the application for asylum or

withholding of removal. To the question “Are you afraid of being

subjected to torture in your home country or any other country to which you may

be removed?,” Dani’s asylum application read, “Am afraid to go

back to abusers. Nature of turture: sexual assault and beat to death.”

[sic] Where the form asked if she feared harm or mistreatment if she returned

to her home country the form stated: “1) Kill by gang husband gang

members 2) Husband and husband gang members 3) because I am running away from

my husband, he can kill me and sexsually asult.” [sic]</p>
<p>These two responses formed the substance of Dani’s

asylum application. She told Human Rights Watch that the judge in charge of her

case ordered her deported at the first hearing after she filed the application.

“I wanted to get a lawyer,” she said. “I didn’t have

one.” </p>
<p>Family detention presents particular due process problems.

In its guidelines on international protection for child asylum claims, the

United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the UN refugee agency,

recommends separate and confidential interviews for all family members to

give each an opportunity to discuss any independent claims for protection.<a href="#_ftn77" name="_ftnref77"><span>[77]</span></a> UNHCR has

also found that a lack of confidentiality could hinder the ability of

women to fully access asylum procedures and recommended that “a

confidential personal interview, that is gender and culturally sensitive,

should be guaranteed in the asylum process, to help ensure access.”<a href="#_ftn78" name="_ftnref78"><span>[78]</span></a></p>
<p>Officials at the Artesia, New Mexico, family detention

center told Human Rights Watch in July 2014 that credible fear interviews were

being conducted with female detainees in the presence of their children. The

children’s presence may have inhibited women from speaking frankly,

interfering with their ability to make their claim, and may further traumatize

both the mother and her children. </p>
<p>Noemi M., who was detained while awaiting an asylum

interview, told Human Rights Watch that she would only speak about the death

threats she received from gangs in Honduras when her 8- and 11-year-old

children were out of earshot.<a href="#_ftn79" name="_ftnref79"><span>[79]</span></a>

DHS officials have since told Human Rights Watch that women in Artesia are

being interviewed by asylum officers separately from their children.<a href="#_ftn80" name="_ftnref80"><span>[80]</span></a></p>
<p>Once a noncitizen in expedited removal has passed a credible

fear interview, detention is no longer legally mandated but at the discretion

of immigration officials. US officials in Artesia told Human Rights Watch that

women and children who file for asylum in immigration court could be detained

throughout the entire process, which can last months or even years. Immigration

attorneys report that ICE is opposing bond requests from women and children in

family detention, arguing that the families pose national security threats.<a href="#_ftn81" name="_ftnref81"><span>[81]</span></a> Such

prolonged detention, with no defined end date, can cause serious psychological

harm, especially for children, including anxiety, depression, and long-term

cognitive damage.<a href="#_ftn82" name="_ftnref82"><span>[82]</span></a>

Marleen V. from El Salvador, who had been detained with her 2-year-old daughter

for two weeks at the time she spoke with Human Rights Watch, said of her

daughter, “I notice her losing weight. She just won’t eat.”<a href="#_ftn83" name="_ftnref83"><span>[83]</span></a></p><a class="link--top" href="#page">Back to top</a></section>
<section data-section="afea19"><h1>
<span></span>
<span></span>
<span></span>
<span>VI. US Law and International

Refugee Law</span>
<a name="afea19"></a>
</h1>
<p>The United States committed to the central guarantees of the

1951 Refugee Convention by its accession to the Refugee Convention’s 1967

Protocol.<a href="#_ftn84" name="_ftnref84"><span>[84]</span></a>

The US government passed the Refugee Act of 1980 in order to bring the

country’s laws into compliance with the Refugee Convention and Protocol,

by incorporating into US law the convention’s definition of a

“refugee” and the principle of nonrefoulement, which prohibits the

return of refugees to countries where they would face persecution.<a href="#_ftn85" name="_ftnref85"><span>[85]</span></a></p>
<p>The US, as a party to the Convention against Torture, is

also obligated not to return someone to a country “where there are

substantial grounds for believing that [they] would be in danger of being

subjected to torture.”<a href="#_ftn86" name="_ftnref86"><span>[86]</span></a></p>
<p>As described above, Human Rights Watch is concerned that the

US system of expedited removal and reinstatement of removal fails to ensure

that the US complies with these international legal obligations, and defeats

other mechanisms already in place in US law (specifically the asylum process in

US immigration courts) to ensure that asylum seekers are identified and have a

fair process through which to present their claims.</p>
<p>In particular, the Hondurans interviewed for this report

described rushed interviews and unsympathetic reactions from CBP officials that

run contrary to international standards on appropriate procedures for the

determination of refugee status. The UNHCR’s authoritative Handbook on

Procedures and Criteria for Determining Refugee Status (“UNHCR

Handbook”), states,</p>
<blockquote>It should be recalled that an applicant for refugee status

is normally in a particularly vulnerable situation. He finds himself in an

alien environment and may experience serious difficulties, technical and

psychological, in submitting his case to the authorities of a foreign country.<a href="#_ftn87" name="_ftnref87"><span>[87]</span></a>
</blockquote>
<p>CBP’s role in the process—involving the same

uniformed and armed agents responsible for apprehending migrants that screen

them for fear of return—conflicts with additional guidance from the UNHCR

Handbook: </p>
<blockquote>A person who, because of his experiences, was in fear of

the authorities in his own country may still feel apprehensive vis-à-vis

any authority. He may therefore be afraid to speak freely and give a full and

accurate account of his case.<a href="#_ftn88" name="_ftnref88"><span>[88]</span></a>
</blockquote>
<p>The rapid-fire nature of the expedited removal process, in

particular the role played by CBP at the outset, is at odds with the

recognition by UNHCR’s Executive Committee (“Excom”) that

expedited procedures may be fair only when applied to cases that are

“clearly fraudulent or not related to the criteria for the granting of

refugee status laid down in the [1951 Refugee Convention].”<a href="#_ftn89" name="_ftnref89"><span>[89]</span></a></p>
<p>Human Rights Watch is also concerned that interviews of

Honduran asylum seekers by Honduran consular officials do not meet

international standards. The UNHCR Handbook states that, by definition, a

refugee’s relationship with their country of origin may be severely

strained. The Handbook also states that, “it is, of course, of the utmost

importance that the applicant’s statements will be treated as

confidential.” In all cases in which a migrant has expressed a fear of

returning home to US border or immigration officials, it is a serious breach of

confidentiality to encourage and facilitate meetings between an asylum seeker

and an official of the asylum seeker’s home government. US immigration

officials, first, should take all reasonable measures to determine whether a

migrant is an asylum seeker, and, second, should preserve confidentiality,

which includes insulating them from home government officials while their

claims are pending. </p>
<p>Detention of asylum seekers should always be a measure of last

resort and should only be for reasons clearly recognized in international law,

such as concerns about danger to the public, or an inability to confirm an

individual’s identity. </p>
<p>Expanding family detention is inconsistent with

international standards, particularly the fundamental principle—reflected

in both international and US law—that “best interest of the

child” should govern the state’s actions toward children.<a href="#_ftn90" name="_ftnref90"><span>[90]</span></a> If

detention of children is used at all, it should only be in rare and exceptional

cases, and for the shortest amount of time and in an appropriate setting where

the children’s needs can be addressed without causing further trauma or

harm.<a href="#_ftn91" name="_ftnref91"><span>[91]</span></a>

Deprivation of liberty has a negative effect on children’s capacity to

realize various fundamental rights, including the rights to education, health,

and family unity.79</p>
<p>Previously, the US government made greater use of

alternatives to detention for families, such as proven “appearance

support” programs that ensure migrants in immigration proceedings understand

how and when to appear.<a href="#_ftn92" name="_ftnref92"><span>[92]</span></a></p>
<p>Finally, using detention explicitly as a deterrent to entry

into the United States for people seeking international protection is unlawful

under international law<a href="#_ftn93" name="_ftnref93"><span>[93]</span></a>

and US law.<a href="#_ftn94" name="_ftnref94"><span>[94]</span></a>

However, the Obama administration has openly stated that one purpose for the

increase in family detention beds is to deter all unauthorized migrants from

entering the country. DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson has referred to detention as

part of an “aggressive deterrence strategy” in Senate testimony and

has told the media that he believed detention “would deter future illegal

crossings.”<a href="#_ftn95" name="_ftnref95"><span>[95]</span></a>

The ICE Assistant Director of Investigative Programs for Homeland Security

Investigations has stated that “[i]mplementing a ‘no bond’ or

‘high bond’ policy would help alleviate these disruptions

by deterring further mass migration.”<a href="#_ftn96" name="_ftnref96"><span>[96]</span></a> The ICE press release

announcing the Dilley, Texas family detention facility stated: “These

facilities will help ensure more timely and effective removals that comply with

our legal and international obligations, while deterring others from taking the

dangerous journey and illegally crossing into the United States.”<a href="#_ftn97" name="_ftnref97"><span>[97]</span></a></p>
<p>As we were finalizing this report, the Obama administration

on September 30, 2014 announced a targeted program to process from inside their

home countries children with lawfully present parents in the United States for

admission to the United States as refugees.<a href="#_ftn98" name="_ftnref98"><span>[98]</span></a>

The program, according to administration officials, would provide a safe

alternative to the dangerous journey to the United States through Mexico for

those children who would qualify to be reunited with a lawfully present parent.

</p>
<p>While this program could potentially assist the relatively

small group of children who would qualify, it would do nothing to address the

protection needs of the vast majority of children and adults who do not have a

lawfully present parent in the United States or who did have such a parent but

who would be too afraid to wait for months or years to be processed after being

threatened by a gang. The existence of this program should not be used as an

excuse for continuing or even expanding the harsh measures already in place at

the border—and in Mexico—to block Central Americans from seeking

asylum and to summarily return them to places where they face a serious risk of

harm.</p>
<p>Whatever policies the Obama administration seeks to put in

place to deter unauthorized migration, it needs to preserve the right to seek

asylum from persecution. The US government should ensure that it does not

deport people crossing the US-Mexico border without proper consideration of

their need for international protection. </p><a class="link--top" href="#page">Back to top</a></section>

<span></span>
<span>Recommendations</span>
<a name="82a606"></a>
</h1>
<p>The recommendations below apply to US treatment of

unauthorized migrants not only from Honduras, the research focus of this

report, but from similarly situated countries where large numbers of migrants

and asylum seekers are fleeing violence by non-state actors and conditions that

prevent that country’s nationals from returning to a situation of basic

security, notably Mexico, El Salvador, and Guatemala. </p>
<p>
<b>To ensure that migrants arriving at the US-Mexico border who

express fear of return to their countries are flagged for screening that would

permit them to access refugee protection or protection under the Convention

Against Torture:</b>
</p>
<h3>
<span></span>
<span></span>
<span></span>
<span></span>
<span>The

Department of Homeland Security should:</span>
</h3>
<ul>
<li>Cease the use of expedited removal for

individuals and families arriving at the US border with Mexico from countries

experiencing conditions that prevent the country’s nationals from

returning to a situation of basic security;</li>
<li>Ensure via training; modification of

oversight mechanisms; accountability measures, including better quality

assurance supervision; and any and all other appropriate measures that initial

interviews of arriving noncitizens conducted by Customs and Border Protection

(CBP) properly identify individuals who express fear of return so that they are

afforded “credible” or “reasonable” fear assessments;</li>
<li>Until that time, instruct CBP to apply a

presumption of fear of return for migrants in expedited removal or

reinstatement of removal who are nationals of countries experiencing conditions

that prevent the country's nationals from returning to a situation of basic

security; and</li>
<li>Unless and until Department of Homeland

Security (DHS) can implement appropriate protection interviews as a part of

expedited removal or it instructs CBP to adopt a presumption for asylum

screening for Central Americans<span class="MsoCommentReference"><span>,

</span></span>instruct Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to conduct a

proactive screening for fear of return for every non-citizen arriving in its

custody from CBP custody. </li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>To ensure that credible and reasonable fear interviews

are fair and efficient:</b>
</p>
<h3>
<span></span>
<span></span>
<span></span>
<span></span>
<span>The

Department of Homeland Security should:</span>
</h3>
<ul>
<li>Ensure that United States Citizenship and

Immigration Services (USCIS) has adequate staffing levels, training, and

supervision; and</li>
<li>Review guidance for USCIS staff to ensure

that the procedures used in “credible fear” interviews do not

unduly bar asylum seekers from access to immigration courts.</li>
</ul>
<h3>
<span></span>
<span></span>
<span></span>
<span></span>
<span>Congress

should:</span>
</h3>
<ul>
<li>Adopt legislation that would allow the USCIS

to conduct timely in-person “credible fear” and “reasonable

fear” screening interviews and address backlogs, without creating delays

for  affirmative asylum interviews;</li>
<li>Adopt legislation to address removal-hearing

delays, eliminate backlogs and conduct prompt hearings, including by increasing

the number of immigration court judges, law clerks, government immigration

lawyers and related resources, as well as increasing incentives for legal aid

and private lawyers to represent migrants in underserved areas.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>To protect children and adults from the harmful effects

of detention and ensure the due process rights of asylum seekers: </b>
</p>
<h3>
<span></span>
<span></span>
<span></span>
<span></span>
<span>The

Department of Homeland Security should:</span>
</h3>
<ul>
<li>Revert to previous US government policy that

limited the detention of arriving migrant families with children. This would

entail closing the new family detention center in Artesia, New Mexico, reverting

the family detention center in Karnes, Texas back to a civil detention facility

for adults, and converting plans to build a 2,400-bed facility in Dilley, Texas

from family detention to adult civil detention. DHS should augment alternative

custody and monitoring programs that ensure court appearances instead of

detention for families and other border arrivals who present no danger or need

assistance to appear in court; and</li>
<li>Apply a presumption in favor of release on

bond or parole for asylum seekers who have passed credible or reasonable fear

screenings.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>To respect asylum seekers’ right to access counsel,

improve disposition of asylum claims, and better ensure that the US does not

return people to countries where they face repression or torture:</b>
</p>
<h3>
<span></span>
<span></span>
<span></span>
<span></span>
<span>The

administration and Congress should:</span>
</h3>
<ul>
<li>Approve reallocation of already appropriated

funds to increase access to counsel for indigent asylum seekers and those

requesting protection under the Convention Against Torture;</li>
<li>Consider passing a law concerning asylum

seekers akin to the provision in the Senate Border Security, Economic

Opportunity and Immigration Modernization Act (S.744) of 2013 that mandates the

US attorney general to appoint counsel, at government expense if necessary, for

unaccompanied minors, people with mental disabilities, and other non-citizens

“considered particularly vulnerable;” and   </li>
<li>Consider passing legislation to allow

immigration judges the discretion to appoint counsel for indigent

non-citizens in all standard immigration removal proceedings.</li>

provisions will be applied and before removing an alien from the United States

pursuant to this section, the examining immigration officer shall create a

record of the facts of the case and statements made by the alien. This shall be

accomplished by means of a sworn statement using Form I-867AB, Record of Sworn

Statement in Proceedings under Section 235(b)(1) of the Act. The examining

immigration officer shall read (or have read) to the alien all information

contained on Form I-867A. Following questioning and recording of the alien's

statement regarding identity, alienage, and inadmissibility, the examining

immigration officer shall record the alien's response to the questions

contained on Form I-867B, and have the alien read (or have read to him or her)

the statement, and the alien shall sign and initial each page of the statement

and each correction.”). Form I-867A includes the provision that the

immigration officer read the following statement:</p>
<p>U.S. law provides protection

to certain persons who face persecution, harm or torture upon return to their

home country. If you fear or have a concern about being removed from the United

States or about being sent home, you should tell me so during this interview

because you may not have another chance. You will have the opportunity to speak

privately and confidentially to another officer about your fear or concern.

That officer will determine if you should remain in the United States and not

be removed because of that fear.</p>
<p>Form I-867B requires that the immigration officer ask

and record the answer to the question, “Do you have any fear or concern

about being returned to your home country or being removed from the United

States?” Forms I-867A&amp;B available in Appendix A of Charles Kuck,

UNHCR Executive Committee Conclusion No. 30 (XXXIV) – 1983 – The

Problem of Manifestly Unfounded or Abusive Applications for Refugee Status or

Asylum, para. (d). The Executive Committee of the High Commissioner’s

Program is UNHCR's governing body. Since 1975, ExCom has passed a series of

Conclusions at its annual meetings. The Conclusions are intended to guide

states in their treatment of refugees and asylum seekers and in their

interpretation of existing international refugee law. While the Conclusions are

not legally binding, they do constitute a body of soft international refugee

law. They are adopted by consensus by the ExCom member states, are broadly representative

of the views of the international community, and carry persuasive authority.

Since the members of ExCom, which includes the US, have negotiated and agreed

to their provisions, they are under a good faith obligation to abide by the

Conclusions.</p>

According to UNHCR, “detention policies aimed at deterrence are generally

unlawful under international human rights law as they are not based on an

individual assessment as to the necessity to detain.” See UNHCR,

“Detention Guidelines: Guidelines on the Applicable Criteria and

Standards relating to the Detention of Asylum-Seekers and Alternatives to

Detention,” 2012, http://www.unhcr.org/505b10ee9.html (accessed October

10, 2014). Detention that is imposed to deter future asylum seekers, or to

dissuade those who have commenced their claims from pursuing them, is

inconsistent with international norms. Furthermore, detention is not permitted

as a punitive—for example, criminal—measure or a disciplinary

sanction for irregular entry or presence in the country. See 1951 Refugee

Convention, art. 31.</p>
