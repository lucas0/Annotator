<p><strong>A school in Florida that dumped the Common Core program in favor of traditional teaching methods has soared to the number one position in the State’s top schools list, according to government statistics.</strong></p>
<p>Mason Classical Academy, a charter school in Naples, Florida, decided against forcing kids to learn the Obama endorsed Common Core method of teaching, due to the way it deliberately dumbs down children and created unnecessary and complicated methods for working out relatively simple problems.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180319173806/http://www.naturalnews.com/2017-07-04-florida-school-dumps-common-core-then-skyrockets-to-number-one-in-english-language-arts-with-90-percent-scoring-proficient.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Naturalnews.com</a> reports: They have rejected the backward approach of Common Core, which sees kids memorize entire words in kindergarten before later being introduced to phonics once they are in elementary school. By that point, their brains are already used to whole words, which makes grasping the concept of phonics and applying it far more difficult than it needs to be.</p><div class="code-block code-block-4" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">

<p>What does the classical approach embraced by the Academy entail? According to their website, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180319173806/http://www.masonclassicalacademy.org/apps/pages/index.jsp?uREC_ID=223870&amp;type=d&amp;termREC_ID=&amp;pREC_ID=436402" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">language-focused learning</a> based on written and spoken words makes the brain work harder to convert words into concepts, while image-based approaches encourage passivity. The time-tested approach of phonics is very likely the reason you are able to read this article in the first place, and it’s hard to imagine why anyone would consider it inadequate.</p>
<p>Thanks to the classical approach of phonics, an impressive 90 percent of the third-grade students at Mason Classical Academy were proficient in English Language Arts, compared to just 58 percent in the county overall, most of whom rely on Common Core. In fact, the MCA third-graders were in Florida’s top two percent, while fifth graders from the academy ranked in the state’s top one percent.</p>
<p>These students look even better when you compare them to California, where the state average is just 43 percent proficiency among third graders. Even worse, six public schools in Baltimore do not have a single student who is proficient in either English Language Arts or math. It’s almost like students are being set up to fail.</p>
<p>Of course, not everyone is happy about this school’s success. Common Core proponents are panicking because these results expose the system for the fraud that it is. The school has been on the receiving end of criticism from everyone from the district’s superintendent to the local news outlet Naples Daily News, according to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180319173806/http://freedomproject.com/the-newman-report/253-charter-school-rejects-common-core-and-ranks-1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">The Freedom Project</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Why is Common Core setting students up to fail?</strong></p>
<p>Among the many criticisms of Common Core is the fact that it is so strongly focused on test results and teachers are so worried about losing their jobs if their students don’t perform that kids are forced into busywork, missing out on the valuable opportunity to develop social skills and boost their well-being through recess outdoors. It also stifles creativity and stresses children out, which can adversely affect their emotional and physical health.</p>
<p>One of its defining characteristics is the way it “dumbs down” many concepts and has students take too many steps to reach conclusions that are obvious to those of us who were schooled the traditional way.</p>
<p>For example, many people were outraged when a second-grade student’s homework went viral after a correct math answer was marked wrong by the teacher because it wasn’t “friendly.” When asked to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180319173806/http://dailycaller.com/2014/03/25/this-common-core-math-problem-asks-kids-to-write-the-friendly-answer-instead-of-the-correct-one/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">solve 530-270</a>, the student arrives at the right answer by subtracting the way most of us were taught in school. Although the student got the right answer, his teacher wanted him to solve it by adding 30 to both numbers so the problem would then be 560-300. There are countless other examples of homework just like this one that illustrate how Common Core is unnecessarily confusing and focused on all the wrong things.</p>

There is limited opportunity to innovate when standardization has become a goal. TED talks, in fact, started as compensating for student inability to utilize a curriculum that was based on the idea of pounding concepts into peoples’ heads rather than being sparked by their interests. That is why sports, music and art provide opportunity to make learning more of a game than an endurance contest.</p>

<div class="dsq-comment-message" id="dsq-comment-message-106680"><p>Mr Toso, you are so wrong, where do you get the concept that U.S  Education is local? It has been controlled by the DOE since the 1908, as I explained in another response to your uneducated information.</p>
<p>The local school boards must adhere to the State Department of Education, who unfortunately today because of money is controlled by the U.S Department of education which is against constitutional law plain and simple.</p>
<p>Do the research, look at all sides and put 2 &amp; 2 together, you will see that education in this country is primarily controlled by the Federal government except in those few states who told the to take a hike and threw Common core out, and several other who have redesigned their own system.<br/>
Your comment on miss- information, is totally off base, the Constitution tells us exactly where education standards belong, and it is not at the federal level, and Common Core is pushed by and supported by the Federal government under the Obama adminstration. </p>
<p>A education program in one state is not necessarily good for another states this has been true for over a 100 years, yet Common Core has this concept that the same thing should be taught in every classroom in every school district in every state.</p>
<p>there are to many vairables across the 50 states to make this feasible.</p>
<p>Like I states earlier, whe have built one of the most technically advanced societies in the world based on the education system we have had since to early 1700’s through the 1990’s. This system today is failing us, our students cannot read cursive writing, they know little of our history, they have a total lack of common sense, just look at the people who question these people at random on the streets of our country; the respondents are idiots, that is what we are education in our k12 and colleges across this country today. yes there is a subset of those who strive to educate themselves to a high degree thank God, but the majority who graduate from high school have a 6-7th grade education level, those from junior college a 12th grade education level. this is what you call improvement?</p>
<p>It is improvement when a student graduates from High School and then has to take a minimum of year of preparatory classes in order to go on to higher education?  In our day we came out of High School prepared to go directly into the leading universities in this country and compete our 4-5 years degrees, go on to our Masters and PhD’s,  </p>
<p>This does not happen today in the majority of cases and statistics will show you this.</p>
<p>Plus the simple fact;] many students do not want to go on to college for a degrees in some field, the want to go into the trades, unfortunately they are directed in this direction by our current education philosophy which causes lots of drop outs and failures in the advanced education forum.  We used to tach the trades in our schools and may students went on into those professions, these are skills taht are still required today.  Yes some but very few districts are starting to bring this concept back, stepping out of the Common Core everyone must go to college concept.  In Minnesota where I used to leive and thank God my kids were educated, we had a Technical college in every county.</p>
<p>Face the facts, the nation as a whole is against Common Core and the indoctrination text books that are being pushed in our current terrible 35 rand education system in the world, and with these numbers you can support it?  Whee did you get you education and when ?</p>
<p>Facts are Facts!</p>

You are describing Trad ed before 1990 &amp; blaming Common Core!!! Teachers adapt to learners while using “one size fits all” classrooms &amp; textbooks. Why would states be more flexible than Feds? That sounds like “old wives tales”!<br/>
I found students who moved between communities often complained about new classmates being way ahead or behind previous ones, even with different teachers in the same schools!! In 1975 I was told it took 2 more years for an engineering degree in U.S. than U.K. 1983 “a Nation At Risk” found U.S. ed behind other countries!! Other nations often require trig &amp; physics for everyone, but U.S. would complain is for math majors only.<br/>
FEDS told states to create standards in the 1990s!! Most were terrible so RTTT asked states.  share standards to cooperate in groups &amp; compete. Common Core was NOT required but states did not want to share their standards &amp; used CC instead.</p>

If I had been told to draw 78 squares and circles, instead of *doing the math*, I’d have run screaming from the room.  At the tender age of 6 years, I already understood negative numbers.  CC curricula have no concept of teaching according to ability and aptitude, only using rote, slowed-down, simplified methods.</p>
<p>CC was designed (just like the ‘Look and Say’ Dick and Jane readers) to limit students’ achievement and initiative.  Keep things at a snail’s pace, overload the day with repetitive, stultifying nonsense, and voila!  you end up with the next batch of ‘learning disabled’ children!  Now you can apply for all that Federal money to help your ‘at risk’ students, while still not really teaching much of value or relevance.</p>

You’re a fucktard in my oppinion.  CA is 49th in the US and we spent the most per student than any place “IN THE FUCKING WORLD” We have a a horrible Le success rate. On avg most kids can’t get into a college based on SATs or thier transcript. They have to go to  a JC to get math and English competency that was taught in HS just 30 years ago. Most can’t compete for entrance into universities head to head against foreign students. </p>
<p>So what if more kids are graduating HS now? When you lower the standards of success, it really isn’t a success. It’s just covering a failure with a bow. Or in my vernacular,; “You can paint a Dog Turd gold, but still it’s just a pretty pile of Shit”</p>
<p> I hire people for the Govt agencybi work for. We ha e been suffering from a lack of candidates qualified to do our work. We had to create a training  program and lower tiers in several classifications because there are no longer young people being educated with the skills we need. 30 years ago a HS grad used to be able to come in and take the tests and qualify; Now we need AS degreed to meet the standard.<br/>
Truth Education has declined because of liberals , Globalists, Republicans, govt, and Fucking Useless Teachers and thier unions.</p>

<div class="dsq-comment-message" id="dsq-comment-message-144059"><p>Actually, Common Core is NOT the issue. You must be aware that remedial training has been a problem for decades. 1983 study found U.S. ed 2 years behind Europeans with wildly inconsistent content &amp; results. Fact is U.S. education is not built to improve the curriculum &amp; there exists no mechanism to discuss improvements. Textbooks have dropped in rigor for decades. 1834 Arithmetic book said “much of Arithmetic is practiced but little learned”. Prof Milgram who refused to sign off on Common Core said most states would still improve by adopting it.<br/>
A 2010 comparison showed most states were significantly lower in quality than Common Core. THAT is the sad state of ed in the U.S. It should be a priority for a meaningful focus to address the issue. Trump statement to end Common Core is NOT a constructive approach when states who do make minor changes with their schools using Common Core materials.<br/>
Blame &amp; rejection are not constructive &amp; local control makes any changes difficult &amp; lengthy. If you care about kids then have a positive attitude with meaningful suggestions because the negative attitude has made education improvements impossible.</p>

The elites cannot have their precious children competing in life with peons.  That’s why for all of their endorsement of public education, they do not put their own children in it.  They all go to private schools.  It’s good enough for the rest of us, but not good enough for them.  The DOE is unconstitutional and needs to be abolished.</p>

<p>Give me a break!  </p>
<p>More than35 years ago, Sidney Simon’s values Clarification was being promoted as a means of teaching students critical thinking skills, problem solving, etc. It actually taught them to be critical of parental values and mores. Same song, different verse. </p>
<p>In 1932 the NEA wrote that teachers of the future would be “learning clinicians”.  The majority of their time would not be teaching facts. </p>
<p>Textbooks are written by educators; not your everyday classroom teacher.  Our college professors are perfect examples of “educators”.  Watch anytime Tucker Carlson interviews a professor. </p>
<p>Today, our kids don’t have textbooks. They use iPads. Parents can’t read the crap their kids are being taught. </p>
<p>That brings up an interesting question. Why do we spend billions of dollars on textbooks when our kids don’t even get them?  If the class has them at all, it’s classroom sets that are only used in the classroom and students don’t take them home.  Easier to hide the indoctrination disguised as teaching. </p>
<p>The results are very obvious. I thought things were bad when my children entered school. What is going on on college campuses, in the halls of Congress, on the city streets all over the country.</p>

1834 “North American Arithmetic” said “much of math is practiced but little learned”. That means students were taught to compute but not how to solve real problems not in familiar forms.<br/>
The word “textbooks” is used to include online resources that students &amp; teachers follow. State standards started in the 1990s to influence textbook content while allowing local choices because locals lack the market demand that publishers need. Standards are limited by the choices made by textbook authors.<br/>
Most states made bad standards so Race to the Top wanted states to form groups to cooperate &amp; compete. Any state could have offered to share its standards but only Common Core was chosen.</p>

I sat in a conference this spring as a run up to our mandated testing and asked the question of state officials regarding the status of common core in Idaho.  I was told that, currently, it is the law and that the state had signed a 3 year contract with a vendor to supply and design testing so even if common core went away, we would be required to follow it for at least another 2 years.  The state representative clearly linked common core to our testing requirements.  She made no mention of NCLB or any other federal regulation.  Is that sufficient proof for you?</p>

I have taught at the elementary level, the collegiate level, and for the US military.  I looked at more learning models than I care to name. I hold a masters degree.  I have also traveled in Europe and the Middle East. My experience tells me that Common Core is a fraud.  While it is laudable to have students succeed, when you remove parents and local educators from the equation and hand control to faceless bureaucrats you get solutions that do not work.  Such a framework results in rigidity more similar to that imposed by Hitler’s Nazi Party and the Soviet Union.  All will march to the dictate of someone a thousand or more miles away who, probably, hasn’t been anywhere near a classroom.  We don’t need federal, or for that matter, state bureaucrats who have no experience teaching dictating to teachers what they will teach, how they will teach, and what will be the outcome.  If you want to support such tyranny, you are an enemy of freedom and of the Constitution.  Now, I am going to put you on ignore as you are a blind fanatic of federal control which makes you my enemy and I have much better things to do than to argue with someone who denigrates my experience, education, knowledge, etc.</p>

<p>“Each State plan shall demonstrate that the State educational agency, in consultation with local educational agencies, has implemented a set of high quality student academic assessments in mathematics, reading or language arts, and science.”</p>

Common Core is a fraud.  It’s public face is to claim it will improve education, when in reality, its purpose is to subvert and to destroy.  Common Core is nothing more  than further attempts by elitists to create a two tier society.  That is a society of them at the top and the rest of us kneeling in submission.  Tear it up!  Throw it out!  The education i received many years ago from the public school system is vastly superior to what I see teachers to day struggling to implement as they are forced to comply with an increasing burden of legislative and regulatory demands.</p>

1834 “North American Arithmetic” said “much of math is practiced but little is learned”. I found many adults quickly confused by simple real life problems because they learned tables &amp; procedures but not how &amp; why math worked.<br/>
I understood the embedded video DID YOU? Many adults did not experience the Brown Vs Education board or they would have agreed.<br/>
Many adults can’t think critically or solve problems unless in standard form.<br/>
Standards teach the same skills to everyone but is not a limitation. CC is the minimum or what everyone should learn but not a limitation.</p>

<div class="dsq-comment-message" id="dsq-comment-message-108669"><p>Common Core standards are NOT more “rigorous” as its proponents claim. Since you (Michael) want to focus ONLY on math and English/Language Arts, let’s go there. Sandra Stotsky, the ONLY ELA expert and a member of the Massachusetts state board of education, hired to validate CC ELA standards, refused to sign off on the standards because they were inferior to the previous standards in many states and “cannot prepare students for authentic college course work.” Likewise, math professor James Milgram, the ONLY mathematician on the CC validation committee, refused to sign off on the math standards saying they would put students two years behind other countries by the time they reach 8th grade and the “get even worse in high school.” He has also publicly stated that only 5% of AP students intending to enter STEM professions, ever graduate with a STEM degree. Even Jason Zimba, one of three creators of Common Core math, admits that the term “college ready” is a “minimal definition of college readiness” and that it is “not only NOT for STEM but NOT for ‘selective’ colleges.” These statements are available on video and in print. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180319173806/http://www.educationviews.org/common-core-college-career-standards-big-fraud/" rel="nofollow">http://www.educationviews.org/common-core-college-career-standards-big-fraud/</a>. For the record, I haven’t read every single comment in this thread, but from my observation, Michael, you are the only one using the term “racism.” Anti-American, anti-Christian and pro-islam bias have been cited hundreds of times by concerned parents nationwide in Pearson (Common Core) textbooks, but their voices are being drowned out by the educrats, many of whom who treat parents with contempt. One of my own local school board members confirmed very recently that our public school teachers are required to teach the five pillars of islam. Why then, are we not teaching them the Protestant apostles creed, the catechism, or the tenets of the Jewish faith? Bill Gates, who dumped billions of his own money into the development of Common Core, signed an agreement with UNESCO in 2004 to train teachers worldwide to teach Common Core. States like Florida and most other states – many with GOP governors have changed 1 to 3% of the curriculum and simply renamed it – like “Florida Standards” Our college entrance exams are Common Core aligned. The lucrative business of Common Core “edcuation” (indoctrination) pays big dividends to the (partially) Saudi shareholder owned multi-billion dollar Pearson conglomerate, which has bought out most of the major publishing companies worldwide (like Houghton-Mifflin and many others), testing corporations and data tracking organizations. It’s proponents and supportive politicians have everything to gain and nothing to lose by supporting Common Core. it will take an act of God to remove the curse of Common Core and to restore true local control of education.</p>

PLEASE compare them before judging!! I do not doubt I am alone in my observations. People look at homework, not standards.<br/>
Even Common Core creators are frustrated at the poor quality curriculum (books).<br/>
Local control requires CHOICES!! Textbook publishers need market demand to change textbooks &amp; locals lack such demand. That is why Feds told states to take charge &amp; create standards in the 1990s. When most states failed, Race to the Top encouraged states to form groups to cooperate &amp; compete with multiple standards. Any state could share its standards to compete with Common Core. They focused on Common Core instead with some states going alone.<br/>
Why are you concerned about Common Core teaching Islam etc when it is ENGLISH &amp; MATH, NOT history? The people saying Islam is taught but not Christianity or other religions seem to forget History is not ONE book or grade!</p>

That’s why countless states/local school districts are being held hostage for federal funding if they don’t implement. You may be correct in saying that it is not a requirement of said state or local school to participate…but, it will clearly come at a cost by not complying to the mandated federal requirement to the contrary!!!

<div class="dsq-comment-message" id="dsq-comment-message-106668"><p>Sorry Mr. Tosco, it was crated by a political think tank in Washington D.C. check out it’s actual history, those educators that were involved many dropped out and even refused to endorse it because of the simple fat it was dumbing down our students and putting them years behind other countries especially in Math.</p>
<p>You are listening to the left propaganda and believing every bit of it. do the research I have for the past 6 years, what they DOE and Obama adminstration told you about a governors board etc was hogwash pure and simple.<br/>
It basically stated in 2008 and maybe a couple years before but full practice of implementation was in 2008, lead by Janet Napalitano, the governor of Arizona, later .the effort was spearheaded by the NGA, CCSSO and Achieve think tanks, 90% to the left of center.</p>
<p>It has been a disaster nationwide and local school board performance data shows it is a failure.  Thanks in part to financial incentives dangled by the Obama administration, more than 40 states had adopted them, the states would not have accepted this standard had i not been  their geed for federal money. 2013 in states like New York, and Indiana new Common Core-aligned tests had sent scores plummeting, ,”I have a Bachelor of Science Degree in Electronics Engineering which included extensive study in differential equations and other high-math applications, Even I cannot explain the Common Core mathematics approach, nor get the answer correct.”</p>
<p>The CCSS adds nothing to what we know about how to teach reading. It adds nothing to how we teach arithmetic and mathematics. It adds nothing to how we teach history, geography, and the “social studies.” In short, it is a fraud to get the American taxpayer to shell out big bucks for something that we already know how to do.  Yes, science has greatly expanded, but it also expanded from 1850 to 1950 and didn’t require a different methodology from the scientific method developed by the great scientists of the past. We may have better equipment which students of science must learn to operate, but the scientific method has not changed.</p>
<p>And of course, the CCSS were made to be as complicated as possible so that no parent or normal human being could understand them. For example, there is something called “Common Core State Standards Official Identifiers and XML Representation.” It states:</p>
<p>People of my generation built this world to what it is today, we went to the Moon and back, have sent satellites off into deep space, built fantastic airplanes that fly, all of this happening over the past 80 plus years-NO Common Core.  today I would hate to fly in a plane built by an individual who throughout their education was allowed to get acceptable on his math problems even of the end answer was wrong, but he followed the Common Core procedure to arrive at that solution!</p>
<p>Every single education p[program that the Federal govt has tried to push on the people has been a total failure, No Child Left Behind cost $7 Billion dollars,  Race To TheTop anther catastrophic failure, </p>
<p>Education is primarily a State and local responsibility in the United States. It is States and communities, as well as public and private organizations of all kinds, that establish schools and colleges, develop curricula, and determine requirements for enrollment and graduation, NOT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT!  92 percent of the funds for public schooling comes from non-Federal sources.</p>
<p>In 1965 the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA Pub.I.89-1- Stat 27, 20 U.S.C. ch 70) launched a comprehensive set of programs.. The Act funds primary and secondary education, while explicitly forbidding the establishment of a national curriculum.  </p>
<p>The Department of Education made a Government department in the 1980 by Jimmy Carter is illegal under the Constitution of this country,<br/>
The Federal government is not given authority under our Constitution to establish or control education, it is a states right under the 10th amendment.</p>
<p>Common C ore has to go, and the Federal Government needs to get out of their forced indoctrination upon our nation by eliminating the Department of Education.</p>
<p>The only states that have continued to go with Common Core are thoise being given money by the Federal government to do so,</p>

States were getting money from NCLB a decade BEFORE RTTT &amp; Common Core. Feds pushed states to create standards in 1990s &amp; prove quality &amp; fairness by each state’s OWN college approval.<br/>
When most states failed RTTT encouraged states to form groups to cooperate &amp; compete &amp; was 70 of 485 points. Common Core was not required but was only group formed. Could easily have states with high quality standards share theirs instead of Common Core. Non Common Core states, like Texas, use similar standards with minimal changes because teaching English &amp; math must teach the same basics like vocab, grammar &amp; arithmetic.<br/>

And the few who were involved were mostly from higher education, almost none from K-12. K-12 teachers WERE invited to “comment” on the CC in groups, but very little was changed based on these groups’ input. Those in charge of CC creation were David Coleman, mainly, with major input/funding from textbook publishers. They took some of the good ideas from the major subject specific research organizations…NCTM, NCTE, etc and totally effed up their ideas. As well as backmapping content introduction so that by kindergarten and 1st grade the material was totally inappropriate.</p>

Search YouTube for articles by Charlotte Iserbyt outlining the Dumbing Down of children. To do that it was necessary to wrest control from school boards and parents and put corporations and governments in charge of ‘standards’….the better to homogenize bullshit.</p>

“Until the Every Student Succeeds Act was passed in December 2015, the US Department of Education had encouraged states to adopt the Common Core Standards by tying the grant of waivers from the No Child Left Behind Act to adoption of the Standards. However, the Every Student Succeeds Act not only replaced the No Child Left Behind Act, it also expressly prohibits the Department of Education from attempting to “influence, incentivize, or coerce State adoption of the Common Core State Standards … or any other academic standards common to a significant number of States.”[20]”    2015,  MEL!

The reason so many states went with Common Core is it better prepares kids for college, which was a problem with NCLB. Kids would have high scores but could not function in college because of weak writing and reading skills. As far as accountability goes, I see very little. The whole system is in disarray and we need to revisit the implementation and accountability. Race to the Top was a bad idea, and Education Dept. under Obama was one area he did not do well with. This does not change the fact Common Core was developed in the states and are better for kids.</p>

They use the English standards but not the math standard. Seven states, including Virginia are not Common Core states at all in any form and they  did not lose any federal funding. It is not true that states MUST adhere to Common Core. I have family in VA that are very conservative and very upset about how schools are working for their kids and they tried to blame Common Core until I pointed out to them that VA did not adopt Common Core.</p>

Clinton, Bush (Bushes), and Obama are all globalists who follow the globalist agenda to dumb down the masses in order to better control them. That’s one reason they all hate Trump who is trying to re-ignite patriotism,  nationalism and capitalism, which have been the engine of enormous prosperity for the majority of Americans.<br/>
This is where partisan debate is worthwhile: If we could eliminate the “government plantation” efforts by democrats to maintain minorities’ dependence upon government largess and, therefore, capturing their votes, and eliminate democrat race-baiting in order to increase racism to further divide us, huge additional numbers of minorities would also be able to participate in this prosperity. But that would destroy the democrats’ voter base so they will never agree to it.</p>

Had he known the lunatic turn the Dems would take during his 8 years he never would’ve signed.</p>

That was so far off base that Cheney’s office had to sack the CIA agent ( NOC ? ) in charge of the nuclear threat desk at the CIA by ‘blowing’ Valerie Plame / Wilson and thus the Brewster Jennings intelligence network in the middle east. The company bled over that one. Scooter Libby took the fall for Cheney’s office. Scuttlebutt was that Cheney was pissed GWB took 2 years to commute his sentence – which plausibly risked the death penalty if it had been possible for the truth to be told.</p>

 That Rutan piece is something I cached years ago. It’ll be interesting to see how that fares in Search.<br/>
Not bad, actually. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180319173806/http://rps3.com/Pages/Burt_Rutan_on_Climate_Change.htm" rel="nofollow">http://rps3.com/Pages/Burt_Rutan_on_Climate_Change.htm</a><br/>
The nation of India was so alarmed by IPCC representations of the melting Himalayas in the future that it assigned its own study team to the topic. They determined the salient factor was action of winds ; direction, moisture content, temperature, etc. CO2 warming action was not validated.<br/>
One other vanished piece of intel was on the temperatures in the Arctic in the mid 30’s. Like today, they were unusually high.<br/>
I really have more solid analysis from people studying cyclic action of weather change ( climate ). And yes, climate refers to weather patterns.<br/>
Here are your NASA atmospheric scientists.<br/>

The night Trump was elected worldwide markets dropped and Gold shot up well over $100 overnight for safe haven demand. Nevermind, Stephanie you don’t understand any of this. Trump’s policies and all star cabinet of business people made the US stock market thrive and if you have a 401K plan, thank Trump and look at your numbers since election night. THis is all 100% Trump because he went to power under removing the stifling employer mandate of Obamacare and he invited the CEOs and business leaders of every sector of the economy to identify to Pres Trump himself what can I do to help you grow business and increase investment. I know those watching CNN don’t get this information, hence why I am here to help you Stephanie. Additionally, lowering the tax rates and a lower penalty to repatriate cash reserves overseas, these ideas have driven optimism. Now if Trump cannot deliver on the promises of no employer mandate, tax reform for individuals and more importantly businesses, you might be better off taking your 401K gains, pay the 10% penalty and go an buy physical gold for safe haven demand. I hear real estate prices are at an all time high again in some areas and the Congress is looking to remove Dodd Frank and we know what happened the last time there was no Dodd Frank and all time high real estate prices and no optimism.</p>

 I am not an educator but I know some who are and they are still debating the value and practicality of CC. My comment was simply that many of the responses tried to tie Obama into the issue. 1-I never mentioned racism, 2-I never mentioned liberalism. However, since you felt the liberty to call me an ass and that I am ignorant, I will take the liberty to tell you that you are one of the hateful and pathetic that I speak of. If you are trolling try staying on subject.</p>

Then the government step in, offered the states money to take the program, this in it’s self was totally illegal if you look at the constitution or understand exactly what ESSA is about. their own statement says it all “explicitly forbidding the establishment of a national curriculum.”  exactly what do you call Common Core?You people on the left will never admit something is wrong because your socialist leaders created it, they have done their work by indoctrination you to all they say is right and everyone else is wrong.</p>
<p>Common Core is a massive failure just like every other education program the federal government has attempted to push on the system, programs to be exact, everyone failed, the last 2 RTTP and NCLBH. $7 billion failures.</p>

<div class="dsq-comment-message" id="dsq-comment-message-96376"><p>I find it fascinating, as a 30-year. preK-college-level  veteran of the classroom, that every single grade level I’ve taught for the past 12 years easily work and think in metric because the math and science books from elementary up ALL use it. We teach the American system, too, but the kids have learned to not be so focused on flat memorization we once taught (they probably won’t be able to tell you how many feet are in a mile, but most adults over 30 can’t either and that was something they’d have reviewed with kids over and over and over from 3rd grade up). Today’s math is more focused on using the measurement as a tool to solve problems. THAT is what Common Core, when taught correctly, is focused on. It actually gives teachers more flex and breadth to teach, but state tests often are directly connected to 1 or 2 publishers’ texts. And, the article above skews dramatically what Common Core supposedly does when teaching literature. Phonics, sight words, Latin/Greek roots, and many other comprehension/fluency skills are taught within it, as well they should be.</p>

<div class="dsq-comment-message" id="dsq-comment-message-102979"><p>I also think it is noteworthy that the primary reason the U.S. did not go full bore into the metric system was because of the auto manufacturing industry here during the 1970’s and early 80’s.  There’s significant documentation, from articles in the main newspapers of the day, to 60 Minutes excerpts, to even the Jr. Scholastic and Weekly Reader newspapers we passed out in classrooms, that it was considered too expensive to retool our auto manufacturing to metric and still be competitive with foreign manufacturing plants. NAFTA and other industry changes have certainly lessened the importance of American standard (Imperial standard)-only measurement. I would also note that many people in Canada, Great Britain, and other countries still use portions of the old measuring system for tasks like baking cakes when the measurements call for it.  It’s a smart thing to be able to work back and forth between systems, to be able to think about what you need to do, rather than just mechanically work within one system.</p>

Just like other things – get the feds involved an it all goes to h— in a hand basket.  As a retired educator of 25 years, I’m dismayed at the decline morale in schools as teachers have to worry every day about their “results.”  They spend inordinate amounts of time and resources training students for successful test results.  This time an resource should be directed at teaching real skills that can be generalized into life skills.  The Pavlovian Response being encouraged does not translate.  The stronger students are going to be stronger anyway.  The weaker students still won’t get it because they don’t have the maturity or background skills to ‘get it.’  The middle students might look stronger.  Is that doing anybody any good?  Let teachers teach as they know from training and experience.  Let government do their jobs and stay out of unknown territory for which they have little or no training.</p>

<div class="dsq-comment-message" id="dsq-comment-message-102393"><p>We are talking about Common Core, NOT NCLB testing &amp; data to ensure quality &amp; fairness. Common Core says TEACHERS know what works in the classroom. Common Core says what skills to teach &amp; teachers following textbooks decide HOW to teach. I am surprised teachers get the facts confused. I interpret the DOE mission “research &amp; inform”  as a library function to SUPPORT local control because locals focus on local concerns &amp; not on how to compete with other states or nations.<br/>
My question is WHY do people want choices limited by state or any other borders? I don’t want Amazon to ask which state then limit my choices. We need a POSITIVE discussion.</p>

Liberals seem to want to inject emotion into everything, and discourage logic, and critical thinking skills. Emotions have their place, but are irrelevant in math, just as they are in many other things. This is beside the point that the government-run, public education system seems to have social/political “group-think” indoctrination as its primary focus – as opposed to training a child to think, and act, rationally, and logically, so as to be successful as an individual. Liberal elites desperately want “the masses” to be controllable, passive, compliant, dependent – and stupid.</p>

The awkward part is that, as teachers, we are trying to get the kids to articulate the same thinking they might do when mentally figuring elapsed time; the total cost, minus discount and then added tips, at a restaurant; potential gas mileage and the risk of waiting 50 miles to get to that next gas station (or, if you are in Canada, those 90ish kilometers).  Those are things we do daily and that we didn’t have to spend so much time teaching kids back when they actually handled money, when everyone used analog watches (still important for teaching ratios, fractions, and many other skills beyond time), when kids spent time measuring, cooking, and making a variety of things, etc.</p>

Unfortunately, because you are so set in your ways and don’t haven’t been able to comprehend this different way, you’re against it. Once common core is understood and it’s applied, math problems – even complicated math problems, can be solved quickly IN YOUR HEAD, without having to line up the numbers and add/subtract one column at a time.   Yes, it’s not as straight forward to learn as lining numbers up in columns, but it is far more efficient and faster once you understand it. But, hey.

Every time you look in your grocery cart, and add it up, you’re using the “Common Core” method.  People ALREADY know how to do that, INTUITIVELY.  We DON’T need to teach that in the schools!  What we DO need to teach kids, is how to arrive at precise answers needed for the sciences.  Kids need to learn the methods of long division, multiplication, etc. They need to know WHY we’re lining up the numbers, and Why we “carry the one”.  They need to understand the terms, “divisor” and “dividend”.  We need to stop wasting valuable school time on short-cut methods, that will only be useful for adding up your grocery cart.  #DumbingDownOfAmerica</p>

<div class="dsq-comment-message" id="dsq-comment-message-96437"><p>Thank you for your points.</p>
<p>Your points on precision and sciences are valid. And, you’re correct, education shouldn’t be only about shortcuts (as in, conducted at a lowest common denominator (aka dumbing down)). But, then again, isn’t that often the purpose of creating disruptive technologies and business practices? (to create shorter or more efficient ways of accomplishing something).    </p>
<p>I’ll concede, there isn’t a one size fits all approach for education and more advanced education needs to be taught/available. On the flip side, many finish primary education without being able to deploy the basic concepts they’ve learned. I think that’s one of the reasons common core was thought to be practical. </p>
<p>You’re right, many are able to estimate the dollar value of their full shopping cart. But, less so by common core, and more so by rounding numbers, which is a part of common core. However, common core is more than rounding numbers, and offers a means to calculate precise numbers, even when used in multiplication or division  (but to your point, there is a limit to the level of complexity that common core can be used. For example, I often calculate derivative values … with common core methodologies I can quickly see if numbers are approximately correct. However, to verify precision accuracy, more advanced methodologies are necessary.) </p>
<p>That said, based on how much debt is carried per capita, I’m assuming that most can’t (or at least, don’t) sum the value of their groceries.  [Yes, I know the reasons for US consumer spending habits and debt loads are more complicated than that, but, it would be interesting to see what part (if any), the failure (or inability) to sum the dollars represented by a full shopping cart, play on consumer spending habits and consumer debt]</p>

The irony is that Common Core DOES teach students why they “carry the one” which is actually not a 1, but a 10 or 100 or 1000 or whatever unit you’ve created by adding smaller units. Every student who has been taught under Common Core by a teacher who understands the standards would be able to explain this to you, and apparently they understand it better than you do.</p>

It IS confusing to children that are 5, 6, and 7 to teach 8+7= 8+2+5 = 15 instead of 8+7 = 15. Do I add the common core way in my head? Absolutely! But not until AFTER I had rote memorized basic facts. I do the same with multiplication as needed. People are amazed that I can come up with answers before they can punch it into a calculator. Not for everything mind you, but many times. It is BECAUSE I have my basic facts down that I can do it, not in spite of.<br/>
Now, having 3 children in school, I can tell you a huge issue that I have seen in the last 10 years. Today we are going to learn how to add fractions, never mind that most of you don’t have your times tables memorized. First we have to have the same denominator, remember how we did the least common multiple yesterday? All of you completed 10 problems correctly, so you mastered that skill. Now we have common denominators we can add the fractions. Here is 10 problems to do in class. Tomorrow we will learn how to subtract fractions…. and literally this is how my oldest daughter’s 4th grade math class went. The next year guess what happened? She didn’t remember learning how to do it. She didn’t practice and review skills enough to RETAIN!</p>

It’s all stupid. I thought when NCLB started it would be so great to have standards and benchmarks the same across the country so that if a child moved to a different state they would not be behind or have skipped a segment of importance. That isn’t the way is works. It’s just a bunch of bureaucrats trying to justify a bad idea. I left teaching in a public school because I had to pay more attention to the low kids by assessing every week and creating lessons for them or sending them to a resource teacher and then having a weekly meeting with that teacher. The other students deserved to grow too, but they were ignored more or less because they already could meet the standards.  That, of course got partially covered by a Talented and Gifted program, but that can’t address enough children.  In addition, I had become a behavior manager, because the kids who find the work too easy act out.  The mediocre students glide through and school is boring for them. Give the schools back to the teachers!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>

<div class="dsq-comment-message" id="dsq-comment-message-96297"><p>As most public school teachers will tell you, teaching to the common core group is a somewhat waste of time and resources. The so called “common core” has been around before President Obama came into office, it just went by different names, had different goals, before being called,”common core”. As a retired public school teacher, I’ve always said that teaching the basics to elementary school children was the best thing for them. “Common Core” can be taught in middle and high school, where it would do the most good.</p>

<div class="dsq-comment-message" id="dsq-comment-message-96381"><p>Mixing educational metaphors… “We’re not doing common core…we’re doing common core-ish stuff.” I opened this hoping to see a description of teacher autonomy. Instead, it is talking as if phonics isn’t in common core (it is – see RF 3 and L 2), using analytical language isn’t in common core (it is – see the anchor standards for all grade levels), etc. I agree that common core has been a tool used by corporations to force teachers into following pre-packaged, scripted gloop with limited flexibility…. because states and districts insist that teachers are there to implement the curriculum rather than the curriculum being there as one of many tools at hand for teachers. I also see huge gaps in common core’s coverage of student skills, and some compartmentalization of things that belong together. However, that doesn’t mean that I think the take that this article has… that dumping pre-packaged CCSS materials is the sole reason for this charter’s success. I would rather suggest a breakdown of numbers for special needs, second-language learners, students from poverty, etc. with aligned comparisons to similar populations…. plus a better look at what teachers are actually doing vs. administrative micro-management of instruction, etc.</p>

<div class="dsq-comment-message" id="dsq-comment-message-96424"><p>My son is entering 5th grade.  As 4th grade wound down he was still struggling with his times tables and basic math.  When I asked his teacher why they didn’t have the kids memorize their times tables from 1 through 12 he said that’s not the way the do it anymore.  His teacher said they gloss over multiplication then move onto something else and would circle back to it.  </p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>That’s like saying we’ll build half the foundation of the basement, then move onto building the upper floors and circle back around to finishing the foundation. I have a Masters Degree in Computer Science.  You CANNOT DO THIS!  Kids need to learn basic addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division before you move onto anything else.  Once I found out how they were “teaching” my son I took it into my own hands to make him learn math.  </p>
<p>His 4th grade class sat at “group” tables and learned in groups.  When kids interrupted they weren’t sent to the principle they were allowed to stay in class and “play” until they calmed down.  WTF!</p>
<p>We need to go back to what worked.  In the 1970-80’s when I went to school we sat in rows of single desks.  The teacher taught and if kids acted up they were removed from class.  You were issued text books that were shared year after year.  Basic math and English has NOT changed regardless of modern technology.  Teach the basics and when the kids hit middle school then introduce technology.  Stop focusing on State mandated test scores and start holding parents accountable for their children’s learning!</p>

That last paragraph, which mentions the teacher marking the student wrong, is where things get dicey.<br/>
In my opinion, the beauty of CC is that it allows students the freedom to use a strategy that works for them. The strategy that teacher wanted her student to use is called compensation and it does work for some students because they’re now subtracting from a “friendly” number (the term has nothing to do with emotion, it’s just kid-friendly language), meaning a multiple of 10 or 100. This allows them to skip-count backwards or perform much simpler subtraction if they think in terms of units (5 hundreds 6 tens – 3 hundreds = 2 hundreds 6 tens)<br/>
However, there is absolutely nothing wrong with solving a different way. In fact, most of my students wouldn’t choose this strategy and I’d be fine with it because CC is about MULTIPLE strategies being used.<br/>
IF CC is taught correctly, it works wonders in reaching students at multiple levels and giving everyone the opportunity to be successful. It can seem more confusing if you haven’t explicitly been taught what the standards mean or why they are taught that way, but I can promise you, from a classroom perspective where my students in Detroit outperform the entire state of Michigan in math, it DOES work. Not only can students DO math, but they can EXPLAIN it.</p>

This school is 78%white. Only 1% of the kids are black and 1% are Asian,  Only 17% of kids attending the school are living in poverty. The school does not list their English Learning population or if they have any children with learning disabilities.</p>
<p>The author of this article wrote with complete bias about a charter school that has a teacher to student ration of 1:15. I looked on schoodigger,com and Mason Academy is ranked 99 not number 1 in Florida. I am wondering where the author found his biased facts. Seems like more alternative facts from someone who does not understand that common core is a set of standards not a teaching method. It was written with teachers.</p>

They ditched common core and their results were much better. Same thing happened in my generation. They started “New Math” ie they tried to teach algebra rules before children learned to add, subtract, multiple and divide. The new books and methods were started in California. The rest of the nation was changing all their elementary school math texts to copy. Then California found out it didn’t work worth a damn. So everyone got to change their books and methods back again. You would think educators would figure out new stuff should be tested in the field to see if it REALLY worked but noooooooo can’t do that.</p>

That way they did not have to have it take years going through the system with funding.  Most states adopted it to get their share of the 400 billion dollar stimulus fund set aside for education, per Obama’s Race to the Top Initiative.  In addition, Race To The Stop stipulated that any state that took the blackmail money, had to agree to fund CommonCore themselves once the stimulus ran out. Clever. </p>
<p>CommonCore is to education like Obamacare to Healthcare. Socialized Education because once the Fed had most all states agreeing to one program, the program then incorporates more and more SJW stuff.  </p>
<p>This way …. getting to our children early on, would complete the indoctrination of the leftist agenda. </p>
<p>Kill commie CommonCore.</p>

<div class="dsq-comment-message" id="dsq-comment-message-108670"><p>Here is my response to “Michael.” Common Core standards are NOT more “rigorous” as its proponents claim.<br/>
Since you (Michael) want to focus ONLY on math and English/Language<br/>
Arts, let’s go there. Sandra Stotsky, the ONLY ELA expert and a member<br/>
of the Massachusetts state board of education, hired to validate CC ELA<br/>
standards, refused to sign off on the standards because they were<br/>
inferior to the previous standards in many states and “cannot prepare<br/>
students for authentic college course work.” Likewise, math professor<br/>
James Milgram, the ONLY mathematician on the CC validation committee,<br/>
refused to sign off on the math standards saying they would put students<br/>
 two years behind other countries by the time they reach 8th grade and<br/>
the “get even worse in high school.” He has also publicly stated that<br/>
only 5% of AP students intending to enter STEM professions, ever<br/>
graduate with a STEM degree. Even Jason Zimba, one of three creators of<br/>
Common Core math, admits that the term “college ready” is a “minimal<br/>
definition of college readiness” and that it is “not only NOT for STEM<br/>
but NOT for ‘selective’ colleges.” These statements are available on<br/>
video and in print.<br/>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180319173806/http://www.educationviews.org/common-core-college-career-standards-big-fraud/" rel="nofollow">http://www.educationviews.org/common-core-college-career-standards-big-fraud/</a>.<br/>
 For the record, I haven’t read every single comment in this thread, but<br/>
 from my observation, Michael, you are the only one using the term<br/>
“racism.” Anti-American, anti-Christian and pro-islam bias have been<br/>
cited hundreds of times by concerned parents nationwide in Pearson<br/>
(Common Core) textbooks, but their voices are being drowned out by the<br/>
educrats, many of whom who treat parents with contempt. One of my own<br/>
local school board members confirmed very recently that our public<br/>
school teachers are required to teach the five pillars of islam. Why<br/>
then, are we not teaching them the Protestant apostles creed, the<br/>
catechism, or the tenets of the Jewish faith? Bill Gates, who dumped<br/>
billions of his own money into the development of Common Core, signed an<br/>
 agreement with UNESCO in 2004 to train teachers worldwide to teach<br/>
Common Core. States like Florida and most other states – many with GOP<br/>
governors have changed 1 to 3% of the curriculum and simply renamed it –<br/>
 like “Florida Standards” Our college entrance exams are Common Core<br/>
aligned. The lucrative business of Common Core “edcuation”<br/>
(indoctrination) pays big dividends to the (partially) Saudi shareholder<br/>
 owned multi-billion dollar Pearson conglomerate, which has bought out<br/>
most of the major publishing companies worldwide (like Houghton-Mifflin<br/>
and many others), testing corporations and data tracking organizations.<br/>
It’s proponents and supportive politicians have everything to gain and<br/>
nothing to lose by supporting Common Core. it will take an act of God to<br/>
 remove the curse of Common Core and to restore true local control of<br/>
education.</p>

As a teacher, I’d love to teach the way I was taught, old school. Unfortunately, our evaluations and the people put in charge of our jobs dictate what we can and cannot do in the classroom these days. Change the leaders, not the old system. Pick people who have been in the classroom for years, with years of real world experience.</p>

Common core would encourage students to think flexibly about numbers. so…. a student wouldn’t have to write this problem down and solve it by the “traditional math” as you call it. I call the old fashioned, long way to solve something that should be mental math. Nice try though. And common core math doesn’t force kids into a strategy, it tries to allow students to understand the concepts and then progress along a natural continuum with a strategy that they understand. Not everyone fits into the same way of thinking about math. Kids understand what place value is, why multiplication works, how to decompose numbers to make long division easier,etc.  Maybe actually understand common core math prior writing an article that is completely biased.</p>

Marking a correct answer wrong for using the wrong method is local grading policy and comes from the traditional “teach the lesson then test for student mastery of the lesson” approach.<br/>
Common Core encourages students to experiment with alternative methods BUT teachers still want to see that students understand the lesson.<br/>
The article’s complaints sound like a sales pitch for Common Core goals.<br/>

<p>Over a decade ago, a group of local school districts and state governors got together and agreed that they needed to define a set of common standards of knowledge by which all students could be judged. This would simplify things when families moved from state to state, and it would ensure that all students had an equal shot at entrance to colleges and universities. This was not a new idea. For example, the National Council  of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM) had been working on a set of nationwide standards already.</p>
<p>The federal government got wind of it and started using it as a cudgel instead of a precision tool. They had no right to do that, and they may have ruined something that was (and still is) inherently good.</p>
<p>Common Core standards ONLY exist for Mathematics and Language Arts. There are NO Common Core standards for science, history or any other subject. Anybody who tells you different is full of bullsh*t.</p>
<p>You can read the standards yourself at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180319173806/http://www.corestandards.org/read-the-standards/" rel="nofollow">http://www.corestandards.org/read-the-standards/</a>. Why don’t you do that before spouting off about them?</p>
<p>The standards do not define HOW the knowledge is to be taught or acquired. That’s left up to the local teachers. Unfortunately, a commercial enterprise bought the commoncore.org URL and started promoting a curriculum under the guise of a nonprofit organization. The curriculum was created and sold by for-profit textbook companies, and THIS is what a lot of people are calling Common Core, but it’s NOT common core. The real common core is at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180319173806/http://www.corestandards.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.corestandards.org</a>.</p>

<div class="dsq-comment-message" id="dsq-comment-message-115184"><p>Common core is simply a faster way to answer a question. The problem with that is the student doesn’t actually learn how to solve that problem only how to get a correct answer. This type of education is what allows many other countries to put out high test scores in grade schools. Which is exactly why it was pushed so hard. One it makes for good press when a political figure says I’ve raised test scores X% over the last how many ever years. 2 it solves a problem many on the left had been trying to solve for years which is low admission of minority’s to college due to bad grades.<br/>
The problem with common core arise in college and later in the work world. The product of not knowing how to solve simple and not so simple problems becomes huge when you now have to actually solve a problem. If we were still a manufacturing strong country then following a predetermined work pattern would be a breeze for for these kids and young adults. However we are not that type of economy anymore. In the US we need to adapt solutions to complex problems that arise daily in any of our high paying jobs. In countries like China where this type of teaching was first introduced they simply follow a preset pattern and go through their day without the need to actually think about what they are doing.<br/>
What it all boils down to is common core is a disaster on our youth and the sooner it is removed the better. The greatest minds of our time were all educated using the old way and it’s no wonder that it has been over 15 years since we have saw a mark zuckleberg or bill gates type of person rise up. In my opinion it’s why these people are pushing this type of education. Not only will it put more money in their pockets but it greatly improves the time that they get stay on top.</p>

Of course traditional methods work – they worked for many years. But obviously not everywhere. What is the background of this school? What was its performance before Common Core? What kind of resources were allocated before, during, and after? Class sizes? Levels of parental involvement? Homework load?</p>

I don’t think this school’s scores has anything to do with the curriculum.

Teachers and schools choose how to get students to learn that standard. Example form kindergarten is RF.K.3 ” Know and apply grade-level phonics and word analysis skills in decoding word. It does say phonics, which is knowing letter sound correspondence, which is important in pronouncing words, and it also has you recognize and read high frequency sight words.  For math 4.O.A.A.2 . Multiply or divide to solve word problems.   That’s it. no where does it say the ‘Japanese method, the lattice method, partial products method or anything like that. Common Core is standards. </p>
<p>It gets a terrible rap, but in reality, the standards are developmentally appropriate and based on Piaget for one, and were based on international benchmarks which were just renamed ‘Common Core’.</p>

However, the concept of sight words – memorizing words – is at least 50-yrs older than Common Core.  Way too many simple words defy phonics that if kids aren’t memorizing at least half of the simple words, they won’t know enough words to read anything.</p>

<p>And, of course rote memorization leads to better elementary test scores, but those grades will plummet, like they always have, for 90% of the kids when they enter algebra. The newer methods take longer to learn because it isn’t just memorizing facts, but learning how math actually works so they then are able to easily transition to higher level math.</p>

I was wondering y my son was having trouble spelling simple words that he should be able to spell in 4th grade. I was helping with the pre and started talking to teachers. I found out that for the last 2 years the state has taken spelling out of the curriculum. Not only do they no longer teach spelling but do not teach cursive either. Not to mention the strange way they want them to solve math problems.</p>
<p>How are these kids supposed to write a resume or a report for work or a book for that matter. They can not if they don’t know how to spell even the months of the year or days of the week.</p>
<p>How will these kids sign a mortgage,bank deposit slip or even a credit application or for their children’s school permission slip?<br/>
What do the administrators and politicians think they are doing because they are not helping our children. I guess it’s up to us parents to teach them these things as if we don’t have enough problems protecting them from bullies,predators and all the other evil in this world.</p>

Teachers are all over the place on grades, and you should go talk to the principal about that policy. There is nothing a K student is supposed to “already know”. There should be direct teaching going on all day in K and the skills are foundational: letters, numbers, beginning high frequency words, etc.</p>

<div class="dsq-comment-message" id="dsq-comment-message-149371"><p>First of all, Common Core had its start in 2007 when George W. Bush was President. Common Core was discussed by state leaders and was pushed by state Governors, not the federal government. In 2009 49 state governors committed their states to working on shared standards. Many Republican governors agreed since nearly every state was involved. Secondly, Common Core is not a teaching method. It does not mandate how schools teach things or which pedagogical methods are used. It presents a set of standards for things kids should learn by certain grades. It does not tell schools how to teach the material, it just sets guidelines for what kids should know.  Common Core does not prohibit using Phonics. The methods chosen to teach reading and meet standards is made at the local district level or at the state level. These decisions are not mandated by Common Core or the federal government. Whether or not phonics is uses is and always have been a local decision. The decision on which math teaching method to use is also not a Common Core mandate. Instructional methods are LOCAL decisions. Our state does not use all of the Common Core standards and we have not lost any federal money. There is no actual federal mandate related to Common Core. Thirdly, standardized testing is not being pushed by one particular party or ideology. In our state, standardized testing is being protected by Republicans in our legislature as a way of holding teachers accountable. Our governor, who is a Democrat, it trying to cut back on mandated state testing and the Republicans in the legislature are not going along. They say standardized testing is vital and critical. Standardized testing got a huge push starting in 2001 with the No Child Left Behind Act under, again under George W. Bush, not under Obama. DeVos and Trump have yet to suggest undoing No Child Left Behind and have also not suggested undoing Obama’s ESSA. They cannot undo Common Core, because, again, Common Core is not a federal mandate. Common Core is voluntarily adopted by states as content guidelines and has nothing to do with pedagogical method decisions made locally.</p>
