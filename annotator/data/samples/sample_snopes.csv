There were street demonstrations and flag-burnings in the Middle East. Libya joined Saudi Arabia in withdrawing its ambassador from Copenhagen. Islamic governments and organisations, including the Muslim Council of Britain, issued denunciations and a boycott of Danish goods took hold across the Muslim world. NI_MPU('middle');The Danish Government warned its citizens about travelling to Algeria, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and Syria, and withdrew aid workers from the Gaza Strip. Last night EU foreign ministers issued a statement in support of Denmark, and the European Commission threatened to report any government backing the boycott to the World Trade Organisation. The fury echoed the outcry that followed the publication in 1988 of the Salman Rushdie novel The Satanic Verses. The trigger for the latest clash of cultures was the publication by the Danish newspaper Jyllends-Posten on September 30 of 12 cartoons of Muhammad. A biographer of the prophet had complained that no one would dare to illustrate his book, and the newspaper challenged cartoonists to draw pictures of the prophet in a self-declared battle for freedom of speech. One submission showed Muhammad wearing a bomb-shaped turban; in another he tells dead suicide bombers that he has run out of virgins with which to reward them. Any portrayal of Muhammad is blasphemous in Islam, lest it encourages idolatry. In October ambassadors from ten Muslim countries complained to Anders Fogh Rasmussen, the Danish Prime Minister, who refused to interfere with the presss freedom. But the issue began to boil this month after the cartoons appeared in Magazinet, a Christian newspaper in Norway, and on the website of the Norwegian newspaper Dagbladet. Imams denounced Denmark from their pulpits, the Arab press inflamed pent-up Muslim anger at the West and last Friday the Saudi Government recalled its ambassador, but still Mr Rasmussen refused to apologise. He condemned attempts to demonise people because of religious beliefs, but argued: The Government can in no way influence the media. By yesterday governments across the Arab world were responding to public outrage. Libya closed its embassy in Denmark and the Egyptian parliament demanded that its Government follow suit. The Kuwaiti and Jordanian governments called for explanations from their Danish ambassadors. President Lahoud of Lebanon condemned the cartoons, saying his country cannot accept any insult to any religion. The Justice Minister of the United Arab Emirates said: This is cultural terrorism, not freedom of expression. In Gaza, gunmen briefly occupied the EU office in Gaza and warned Danes and Norwegians to stay away. Palestinians in the West Bank burnt Danish flags. The Islamic groups Hamas and Hezbollah and the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood demanded an apology. Supermarkets in Algeria, Bahrain, Jordan, Kuwait, Morocco, Qatar, Tunisia, the United Arab Emirates and Yemen all removed Danish produce from their shelves. Arla Foods, a Danish company with annual sales of about $430 million in the Middle East, said that the boycott was almost total and suspended production in Saudi Arabia. The Muslim Council of Britain, whose leaders are to meet the Danish ambassador tomorrow, deplored the newspapers refusal to apologise for printing sacrilegious cartoons vilifying the Prophet Muhammad. Bill Clinton, the former US President, added his voice, telling a conference in Qatar that he feared anti-Semitism would be replaced with anti-Islamic prejudice. He condemned these totally outrageous cartoons against Islam. Per Stig Moeller, Denmarks Foreign Minister, insisted in Brussels last night: We condemn blasphemy. We want respect for religions. But we cannot intervene. We have sent explanations but, as we have said before, freedom of expression is a matter for the courts, not for the Government. A spokesman for Peter Mandelson, the EU Trade Commissioner, said that if the Saudi Government had encouraged the boycott of Danish goods, Mr Mandelson would take the matter to the WTO. Carsten Juste, editor-in-chief of Jyllends-Posten, which has hired extra security after staff received death threats, said that the drawings were not in violation of Danish law but have offended many Muslims, which we would like to apologise for. He added that the drawings were sober and were not meant to be offensive to Muslims.

https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/trump-asylum-white-supremacist/	president donald trump offered asylum to aleksei makeev, who was attacked in mexico.	False	['aleksei makeev', ' lord nazi ruso', ' president donald trump']	http://www.thedailybeast.com/	http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2017/05/21/racist-taunts-by-a-russian-nazi-inspire-a-lynch-mob-and-a-murder-in-cancun	2017/05/24	LORD RUSSIAN NAZIMexican Mob Nearly Lynches Russian ‘Nazi’ in CancunAvowed Nazi sympathizer Aleksei Makeev made himself a nuisance online in Mexico. People who have no faith in police responded with mob justice.05.21.17 11:00 AM ETPhoto Illustration by Elizabeth Brockway/The Daily BeastMEXICO CITY—“Kill him! Kill him! Kill him,” chanted a mob of roughly 100 angry Mexicans in Cancun, the popular tourist destination on the coast of Quintana Roo, Mexico. “I’m going to decapitate you,” one man shouted at Aleksei Viktorovich Makeev, as the bloodied 42-year-old Russian resident of Mexico fled the interior of his home for a nearby rooftop while the mob pelted him with large rocks and jeered. When Makeev finally collapsed on the rooftop, covered in his own blood—and that of an unarmed teenager whom he stabbed moments before, after the teen attempted to enter the Russian’s apartment—the townspeople finally let him be, as reporters livestreaming from the scene claimed that Makeev had died.In fact, after being beaten with sticks and stoned nearly to death, the half-naked Russian was transported to a local hospital and treated for his injuries. The townspeople had fractured his skull.Makeev is now reportedly in stable condition, but remains in a drug-induced coma, paralyzed and likely brain-damaged, said Dmitry Bolbot, Mexico City’s Russian consul. But the 19-year-old youth whose last name has not yet been disclosed, “Lalo”—a nickname for Eduardo—bled out on the pavement as paramedics attempted to save his life. He was pronounced dead soon after Makeev stabbed him repeatedly in the stomach with a kitchen knife as he fled the home. The horrific stabbing was also caught on tape.“The Russian has just stabbed this person. He’s losing a lot of blood,” someone said in one of many livestreams of the hours-long encounter, as thousands of social media users watched from their phones and computers, leaving comments like “Cut off [the Russian’s] head! Toss him in a ditch,” and “Finish him off! Get it over with!”The mob descended on his home after local media reports began circulating on Friday about Makeev, who had spent the previous months uploading videos of himself on his personal YouTube channels surrounded by swastikas.In the videos, one can see that he had made a hobby of disparaging the people of Mexico, speaking with particular loathing about indigenous women and infants. He was dubbed #LordNaziRuso on social media—Lord Russian Nazi—and outrage quickly grew.Just past noon on Friday, Makeev posted on Facebook that he was “feeling adventurous,” along with the comment that “Terrorists are trying to kill me!”Hours later, he posted a crude drawing that read “lick my dick Mexican piece of shit” as he laughed at the angry crowd that had begun to phone him and cover his Facebook wall with angry comments.By dusk, as the mob formed outside the tiny one-room apartment in Cancun from which he often posted videos at his untidy desk—next to cans of peas and other food lining the windowsill— a local reporter with a drone began to film the lead-up to the lynching attempt, as Makeev sat at his desk and continued to poke the bear and mock the people online.From that desk—seated next to a family-size bottle of ketchup and more pictures of swastikas and promotional material for his unpopular YouTube channels—the Russian had repeatedly posted videos complaining about both the Mexican people and their police in a mix of Russian and the occasional insult in English or Spanish.Though he made himself completely unwelcome in Mexico, Makeev—who is originally from the small town of Elektrostal, on the outskirts of Moscow—had also previously made a name for himself in Russia where he was apparently put under review by the Ministry of Internal Affairs in 2013, after footage posted online showed him shoving an elderly woman and child. He was reportedly interned in a Russian psychiatric facility for his erratic behavior as a result.“If the government doesn’t want to do anything, if our authorities can’t, we’re going to get together and do this right,” said one man in a livestream Friday night, just before the lynching attempt began, inviting the people of Cancun to come down to the man’s home and get him. “We aren’t going to lynch him, because that sounds bad, but we are going to teach him a lesson.”“Cancun deserves respect,” the man said, adding, “It’s the most beautiful place you could ever imagine.”The bizarre videos Makeev became known for show his fanatical obsession with Madonna and knives, and that he far too often sat at the local McDonald's in Cancun, invasively filming humble Mexican diners— zooming in on the faces of what he called their “bastard” children, and referring to the people as “monkeys” and “pieces of shit.”In one video, filmed from a local rooftop, he stood shirtless next to a swastika and—wearing a clown nose—referred to “McDonald… Trump.” Many of his Facebook posts, in fact, relate to the various controversies involving the U.S. President’s alleged ties to Russia.He had been getting on people’s nerves for a while, but had made at least a few friends locally. Just two weeks ago, he uploaded a video of himself interviewing an American man who called himself Roy, who claimed to have been beaten by the local police, after picking up some cash from a local Western Union. He said the cops “took [his] $200,” stranding him in Mexico without a passport.“When I woke up, I’m on my hands and knees. And when I got up, I seen my teeth, so I picked ‘em up and put ‘em in my pocket, and the muth... uh, they had gone. They left. So, I was left with nothing, and I was left with this,” said a toothless Roy, pointing to a blackened right eye. “So I advise anyone coming here, be careful. The police are very corrupt.”It was a common theme in his videos. When not complaining about Mexicans, he complained about their cops.Last December, he was locked up for a month in an immigration center in Quintana Roo and declared persona non grata after repeatedly threatening the local Maya people . He complained in videos that he had not been given water, and had been treated poorly in detention. In a statement, the National Migration Institute said that Makeev’s “definitive exit from the country was ordered on January 19” of this year.But Makeev, who was previously employed as a scuba instructor at AquaWorld Cancun, remained in the country regardless. When contacted on Saturday, the watersports company was unable to offer any comment, but said in a statement that he stopped working with them in November 2015, after they noticed that “his behavior had begun to turn aggressive.”A statement reportedly from the Russian Embassy did not condone his actions in Mexico, but added that they “categorically reproach the manner in which Mexican citizens did not attempt to denounce [his actions] but instead took matters into their own hands,” asking Mexican authorities to help clarify these “unfortunate events.”But citizens and residents had reported his behavior to immigration authorities in recent months, even after his recent detention. One local radio disc jockey, 55-year-old Fabricio Rechy, provided The Daily Beast with screenshots of a conversation he had with immigration authorities this past February, in which he sends authorities the worrisome videos he had come across, requesting that the Russian be removed for posing a danger to the local people.During his conversation, the immigration employee at first implied that the videos were filmed in Russia, but the radio host pointed out that they were filmed inside the local McDonald’s. He even made it easy for them, providing screenshots of the man’s immigration documents.“They thanked me for the information and said they would investigate,” Rechy said in a telephone interview on Saturday. “But I doubt they gave it any importance.”“I stumbled on the videos, and saw the way he was threatening people, calling them shit, saying he was going to kill Mexicans, cut off their heads, and I thought he was a dangerous person, so I felt the need to report it. It’s my duty as a citizen,” he said. “There are videos that show him giving babies the middle finger, throwing coins at an old woman in a grocery store, hitting another elderly lady inside a bank, and stepping on children’s lunch on the beach.”As for the incident that ended one young man’s life on Friday night, Rechy said, “It never should have happened.”“The police arrived at night, but left saying they couldn’t do anything because the man was locked inside his home,” he said.Later that night, “about half an hour after the lynching started,” when the riotous fighting was well under way, the police finally returned with backup. But by then the situation had become unmanageable.As paramedics transported Makeev’s unconscious bloody body to the hospital late Friday night, smiling families cheered and screamed insults at him—at times chanting, “Mexico! Mexico! Mexico!”The National Immigration Institute said in a statement that it would seek his repatriation back to Russia as soon as his legal situation in Mexico is determined.But, Rechy noted, “None of this would have happened if they had just taken notice when I asked them to.”“That boy would still be alive,” he said. “Unfortunately, this is a national problem in Mexico—the lack of authority, and the authorities’ inaction. I hate to say it, but we are used to corruption here in Mexico.”“There just isn’t any trust,” he said. “People prefer to take justice into their own hands than deal with authorities. That’s how this works.”--------------------The Daily Beast’s Moscow-based correspondent Anna Nemtsova contributed to this report.READ THIS LIST	2017/01/30	snopes

https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/handgun-student-stabbing/	a student with a concealed handgun stopped a mass stabbing at the university of texas.	Unproven	['concealed carry', ' guns', ' infowars', ' stabbing', ' university of texas']	http://www.thetruthaboutguns.com/	http://www.thetruthaboutguns.com/2017/05/foghorn/breaking-armed-student-reportedly-stopped-mass-stabber-ut-austin/	2017/05/04	emailReports are coming in that the mass stabbing reported earlier today at the University of Texas Austin campus was stopped by a legally armed student with a handgun. According to social media postings by the current UT Austin student body president a student with a concealed handgun license saw the stabbing attack in progress, drew his firearm, and chased down the attacker. If true, there’s little doubt that the quick action on the part of this legally armed student may have stopped the attacker from injuring and possibly killing more people.UPDATE: Later reports from the same source indicate that the earlier report about an armed student are unconfirmed. However there is additional supporting evidence posted by another user on social media claiming to have been the CHL holder in question.Texas recently passed legislation enabling students with a concealed handgun license to carry their handgun in most areas of campus, excluding lab areas and other sensitive locations. A group of students and staff opposed this new legislation by forming the group Gun Free UT , organizing a dildo-filled “cocks not GLOCKs” protest , and proclaiming that carrying concealed handguns on campus will make UT less safe not more safe. There is no comment yet from Gun Free UT about this particular event.Making this story more interesting is the fact that the armed student reportedly stopped the mass stabber without firing a single shot. Concealed carry opponents constantly use the argument that civilians aren’t as well trained as police officers and will cause more harm than good in an emergency situation, but as this case illustrates that’s a complete and total fabrication. Even in the heat of the moment the CHL holder in this case understood that it was more dangerous to fire his gun in the middle of campus than to simply chase the mass stabber away.For those keeping score, organizations such as The Trace will refuse to classify this incident as a defensive gun use since the knife wielding attacker was not killed and no rounds were fired by the CHL holder.	2017/05/01	snopes

The new memorial will make good on President Trump's promise to bring about a peaceful resolution to the nearly 20-year contrived conflict.""President Trump is proud to declare victory in the War on Christmas,"" said a White House spokesman, who repeatedly asked that their name not be used. ""No longer will the celebration of Christmas be restricted to private homes, multiple 24/7 radio stations, non-stop television specials, Christmas themed commercials interrupting those television specials, decorations in every major retail outlet, proclamations from elected officials, and a federal holiday. Now that the War on Christmas is over, this cherished religious holiday can finally get the recognition it deserves. The President believes his victory in the War on Christmas will be among the greatest achievements of his presidency.""At the consecration ceremony for the new monument, President Trump is expected to issue an official proclamation establishing that ""Christmas"" will now refer to the entire period of time between Thanksgiving and New Year's Day.The proposed monument is expected to feature several installation pieces, each highlighting a different aspect of the War on Christmas. So far, the proposed monument includes:A memorial to everyone who was wished ""Happy Holidays"" by a department store cashier;An exhibition of anti-Christian Starbucks cups;A statue commemorating the ""Faceless Fox News Staffer,"" which will honor the unsung Fox News staff and interns who were forced to scour the internet for any story that could be plausibly spun to look like an attack on Christmas; andA life-size Nativity Scene.Following the announcement, the White House has been forced to respond to a litany of criticisms, including accusations that the monument constitutes religious favoritism and is ""wildly unnecessary.""""If you analyze this decision in the context of how the President and his cabinet view ‘religious freedom,' it makes a lot more sense,"" said the anonymous White House staffer before letting out a loud and heavy sigh. ""Like many of the President's policy decisions, this announcement comes following a meeting with the nation's leading religious right groups. The President shares their conviction that this monument will help reassert the principle of religious freedom, which is the inalienable right of every American to believe in conservative evangelical Christianity.""""This monument is as unnecessary as it is unsurprising,"" said Larry T. Decker, Executive Director of the Secular Coalition for America. ""This is a monument to religious privilege and a message that Christian supremacists should feel emboldened. What's next? Are we going to display the Ten Commandments in public schools? Or entomb a leader of the religious right in our nation's capital? Or mandate that a specific set of religious beliefs be treated like a get-out-of-jail-free card ? While a monument commemorating the War on Christmas is especially outlandish, would any of those hypotheticals really be any less galling?""HAPPY APRIL FOOLS DAY!"	2018/03/30	snopes

However, authority websites including the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute and the Mayo Clinic do not mention drinking water, when discussing treatments and lifestyle changes for hypertension.Why should some articles say that drinking water lowers blood pressure?The idea that drinking water will lower blood pressure seems to come from the idea that when lots of water is consumed, that sodium will be flushed out of the body and consequently pressure will drop.After all, several classes of diuretics are very effective at reducing pressure. These diuretics function by increasing the loss of sodium from the body and an increased volume of urine. Both the loss of sodium from the blood and decreasing the blood volume result in decreased blood pressure.So, if drugs, that effectively lower blood pressure in most people, work by increasing the volume of urine and the amount of sodium in the urine, then drinking more water should do the same thing?Unfortunately, there is a problem with this reasoning. To understand why, it is necessary to understand that the body very tightly controls the levels of fluid and ions such as sodium and calcium. For optimal functioning, the body has evolved a wide range of control processes that are involved in keeping many ions and fluid levels within a narrow range.Diuretics act on parts of the system that control sodium. For instance thiazide diuretics bind to, and inhibit, a protein called the Na/Cl symporter (Na=sodium, Cl=chloride) that controls the amount of sodium that is reabsorbed back into the blood from the urine that is being formed. The result is that the body recovers less sodium from the urine as it is being formed, and so more sodium is lost in the urine and there is a slight increase in volume. So diuretics affect the regulatory system and change a part of this.Water has no impact on the sodium or fluid control system so it will not change the total amount of sodium in the urine, or change the blood volume. Drinking more water will increase the volume of urine as the body regulates fluid levels, to keep the blood volume stable. Additionally, the same amount of sodium (and other ions etc.) in a bigger volume will lead to the urine being more dilute.Think about the color of urine. If not much fluid has been consumed, or there has been a lot of sweating, there will a small quantity of urine with a strong yellow color (from urobilin). If a person is well hydrated, there is more urine with a pale color. Same thing with sodium. In a healthy individual, the greater the volume of urine due to increased fluid consumption, the lower the concentration of sodium.So the bottom line is that, generally, increasing the amount of water that is consumed will not increase the amount of sodium lost by the blood, so blood pressure will not be lowered.In fact, drinking water can actually cause a very short term increase in blood pressure in some people, particularly those with some types of very low blood pressure. This is only temporary and has no long term impact on blood pressure.Keeping hydrated is good for health, but overhydration has no benefit for lowering blood pressure.Judith Airey PhD. is a biomedical researcher with a range of interests including all things cardiovascular.

Brown Jr. today ended the drought state of emergency in most of California, while maintaining water reporting requirements and prohibitions on wasteful practices, such as watering during or right after rainfall.“This drought emergency is over, but the next drought could be around the corner,” said Governor Brown. “Conservation must remain a way of life.” Executive Order B-40-17 lifts the drought emergency in all California counties except Fresno, Kings, Tulare and Tuolumne, where emergency drinking water projects will continue to help address diminished groundwater supplies. Today’s order also rescinds two emergency proclamations from January and April 2014 and four drought-related executive orders issued in 2014 and 2015. Executive Order B-40-17 builds on actions taken in Executive Order B-37-16 , which remains in effect, to continue making water conservation a way of life in California:The State Water Resources Control Board will maintain urban water use reporting requirements and prohibitions on wasteful practices such as watering during or after rainfall, hosing off sidewalks and irrigating ornamental turf on public street medians. The state will continue its work to coordinate a statewide response on the unprecedented bark beetle outbreak in drought-stressed forests that has killed millions of trees across California. In a related action, state agencies today issued a plan to continue to make conservation a way of life in California , as directed by Governor Brown in May 2016. The framework requires new legislation to establish long-term water conservation measures and improved planning for more frequent and severe droughts.Although the severely dry conditions that afflicted much of the state starting in the winter of 2011-12 are gone , damage from the drought will linger for years in many areas. The drought reduced farm production in some regions, killed an estimated 100 million trees, harmed wildlife and disrupted drinking water supplies for many rural communities. The consequences of millions of dead trees and the diminished groundwater basins will continue to challenge areas of the state for years.California’s Drought ResponseThe drought that spanned water years 2012 through 2016 included the driest four-year statewide precipitation on record (2012-2015) and the smallest Sierra-Cascades snowpack on record (2015, with 5 percent of average). It was marked by extraordinary heat: 2014, 2015 and 2016 were California’s first, second and third warmest year in terms of statewide average temperatures.The state responded to the emergency with actions and investments that also advanced the California Water Action Plan , the Administration’s five-year blueprint for more reliable, resilient water systems to prepare for climate change and population growth. To advance the priorities of the Water Action Plan and respond to drought, the voters passed a comprehensive water bond , the Legislature appropriated and accelerated funding and state agencies accelerated grants and loans to water projects.California also enacted the historic Sustainable Groundwater Management Act , took action to improve measurement and management of water, retrofitted tens of thousands of inefficient toilets, replaced lawns with water-wise landscaping and provided safe drinking water to impacted communities. Californians also responded to the drought with tremendous levels of water conservation, including a nearly 25 percent average reduction in urban water use across the state. ###	2017/04/18	snopes

False	['donald trump']	https://www.reuters.com/	https://www.reuters.com/article/us-nato-summit/trump-lashes-germany-demands-allies-double-nato-spending-idUSKBN1K032D	2018/07/16	July 10, 2018 / 11:19 PM / in 4 monthsTrump calls Germany 'captive' of Russia; demands higher defense spendingJeff Mason , Robin Emmott , Alissa de Carbonnel5 Min ReadBRUSSELS (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump accused Germany on Wednesday of being a “captive” of Russia due to its energy reliance, before a NATO summit where he pressed allies to more than double defense spending.Having lambasted NATO members for failing to reach a target of spending 2 percent of national income on defense, Trump told fellow leaders in Brussels he would prefer a goal of 4 percent, similar to U.S. levels, officials said.That would represent a massive upheaval of budgetary priorities in Europe where Germany and many others have pledged only to reach 2 percent by 2024 or later, and it was not clear what allies would spend the money on.At the end of the first session of a two-day summit, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said the aim first was to reach 2 percent, but moments later Trump tweeted that allies were undercutting the United States on trade and needed to immediately up spending.The exchange was part of an uncomfortable day as anxious Western allies were subjected to the U.S. president’s “America first” approach. His comment that Germany was controlled by Russia earned a rebuke from Berlin.“We are not prisoners, neither of Russia nor of the United States,” Germany’s Foreign Minister Heiko Maas told reporters.TWO TRUMPSBut Trump was also at times enthusiastic and affable, exchanging embraces and handshakes with fellow leaders, posing for photographs in front of a NATO military band and mingling at a summit dinner in a Brussels museum.Related CoverageNATO formally invites Macedonia to join allianceUnlike a fraught Group of Seven summit in Canada in June, Trump did not block a final leaders’ statement, which paved the way for Macedonia to start NATO membership talks and a modernization of the alliance to better deter Moscow.Earlier, Trump strode into NATO’s new glass-and-steel headquarters and into the amphitheatre-like North Atlantic Council decision-making chamber to shake hands with leaders - but only after publicly railing against Germany, one of NATO’s top European powers, at a breakfast meeting with Stoltenberg.Trump told Stoltenberg Germany was wrong to support an $11-billion Baltic Sea pipeline to import even more Russian gas while being slow to meet targets for NATO spending.“We’re supposed to be guarding against Russia, and Germany goes out and pays billions and billions of dollars a year to Russia,” Trump said in the presence of reporters.“We’re protecting Germany, we’re protecting France, we’re protecting all of these countries. And then numerous of the countries go out and make a pipeline deal with Russia where they’re paying billions of dollars into the coffers of Russia,” he said. “I think that’s very inappropriate.”Trump appeared to substantially overstate German reliance on Russian energy and to imply Berlin was funding a pipeline that Chancellor Angela Merkel says is a commercial venture.She hit back by contrasting her own experience of growing up in Soviet-controlled East Germany with the sovereign, united Germany now playing a major role in NATO.Trump and Merkel later held businesslike talks on the sidelines. Trump said he had a “very, very good relationship” with Merkel who described the two as “good partners”.U.S. President Donald Trump attends a meeting of the North Atlantic Council during a NATO summit in Brussels, Belgium July 11, 2018. REUTERS/Francois LenoirA source close to French President Emmanuel Macron said Trump had voiced his “personal attachment” to Europe and gave “rather positive and constructive messages” to his allies.“There is no break-up between America and Europe,” the source said after Macron and Trump held “friendly” talks.WEAKENING BOND?But with tensions in the alliance smoldering over Trump’s trade tariffs on European steel, his earlier comments fueled concerns about the U.S. role in keeping the peace that has reigned since World War Two.Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel called for “fair play” and more respect for multilateralism.Baltic leaders, fearful of any repeat of Russia’s annexation of Crimea, called for unity, while Slovak President Andre Kiska said his country was “one of the good guys” because it was increasing defense spending.Those comments underscored the risks to Trump’s strategy by dividing allies between those who spend more on defense and those who do not, such as Belgium, Spain, Italy and Luxembourg, but who contribute with troops to NATO missions.NATO’s Stoltenberg later told reporters that Trump, who will meet Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday, had used “very direct language” but that NATO spending was rising strongly.The NATO chief was also frank about the impact of Trump’s stance at a broader level.Slideshow (14 Images)“There are disagreements on trade. This is serious. My task is to try to minimize the negative impact on NATO,” he said.“So far it hasn’t impacted on NATO that much. I cannot guarantee that that will not be the case in the future. The transatlantic bond is not one, there are many ties, some of them have been weakened.”Additional reporting by William James, Sabine Siebold, Humeyra Pamuk, Phil Stewart, Writing by Alastair Macdonald and Robin Emmott, Editing by Mark Heinrich and Robin Pomeroy	2018/07/11	snopes
https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/alien-mummy-baffles-scientists/	"an ""alien mummy"" was recently unearthed in a pyramid, and scientists cannot explain its origins."	False	['worldwide science stories']	https://outlook.wustl.edu/	https://outlook.wustl.edu/2007/summer/mummy.htm	2016/03/21	"Download the Baby Mummy graphic.For more than two decades, the baby mummy remained in a storage facility at the Saint Louis Science Center.One day last spring, Washington University scientist Charles F. Hildebolt got an intriguing phone call. A mummy had turned up in the storage facility of the Saint Louis Science Center (SLSC), but no one knew much about it. Could he and his colleagues do some detective work to learn more?""When you hear the word 'mummy,' you think big box or large tomb,"" says Hildebolt, DDS, PhD, a dentist and anthropologist in the Department of Radiology. ""It was a surprise when we got over there and found that this was a small child, partly unwrapped and in a little pine box. We said, 'Wow! This is really interesting.' But we didn't know exactly what we'd be able to find out.""Charles F. Hildebolt, DDS, PhD, enlisted the help of Li Cao, MD, center, and Anne M. Bowcock, PhD, to retrieve and analyze the baby mummy's DNA.Hildebolt and other volunteer investigators from the School of Medicine, helped by experts from around the world, began a yearlong quest to uncover the mummy's past. Assisted by the latest technology — sophisticated CT scanning, DNA analysis and radiocarbon dating — they pieced together a likely story of love and loss, of ancient Egypt and European conquerors, of theft and recovery, that has attracted international attention.At the same time, they made a bit of scientific history. Although the record of child mummies in existence is still incomplete, they are ""exceedingly rare,"" says Hildebolt. The extensive research they have done to understand this one may well rank, he says, ""as the most extensive work ever done on a child mummy.""What information they had when they began came from SLSC records. Around the turn of the last century, a dentist from Hermann MO was traveling in the Middle East when he acquired the mummy as a keepsake. Back home, a niece eventually inherited it, and she brought it out for display on Halloween. Her family donated it to the SLSC in 1985.For two decades, the small mummy remained in the SLSC storage facility until new vice president Al Wiman noticed it in 2006. ""The first thing I asked was 'What do you know about it?' Well, they knew it was a boy,"" he says today. ""'Do you know anything else?' No, they didn't.""Once Washington University agreed to help, Mallinckrodt Institute of Radiology was the first stop. Hildebolt, a veteran of other forensic detection efforts, recruited Kirk Smith, a senior research engineer with CT expertise. Smith did the full-body scanning, and Hildebolt and pediatric radiologist Steven Don, MD, studied the results in hopes of determining the child's age and cause of death.""It was just what a doctor would do with a living patient except that we could scan at a very high resolution, with an X-ray dose you would not use on a live person,"" says Smith. ""We also have state-of-the-art CT scanners, among the best in the world.""They captured some 1,000 CT slices, which Smith integrated for an overall look and segmented for close-ups. From the teeth and cranial sutures, Hildebolt and Don established the child's age: 7 to 8 months. They hypothesized that, in the tradition of Egyptian mummification, his organs had been removed through a hole in his left side and his brain through his left nostril. Within the mummy, they could see amulets at a tantalizing distance, but couldn't make out any inscriptions that might pinpoint the child's identity.Canopic jars (reproductions pictured here) were used to hold the dried internal organs of Egyptian mummies.So far, everything indicated an Egyptian place of origin, but how to prove it? Other cultures also mummified the dead. With the help of paleoneuroanatomist Dean Falk, PhD, from Florida State University, who confirmed the brain removal, they contacted Salima Ikram, PhD, an Egyptologist at the American University in Cairo. Snipping a postage-stamp-sized piece of the wrapping material, they sent it to Ikram, who passed it on to Emilia Cortés, a textile conservator at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. She determined it was Egyptian wrapping material from the Roman period in Egypt, around 2,000 years ago.Ikram unraveled other pieces of the mystery. True to Roman-period mummification custom, this mummy had a wooden rod placed at its back for support. The dark brown color of the body and the linen wrapping — turned gentle shades of beige in the CT scans — was the product of resins and oils used in the 70-day mummification process. As to the mummy's origin, Ikram says, it ""definitely"" came from a grave that was plundered by robbers, ""but several sites are possible, so I shall not speculate.""Sadly, its very existence may point to sorrow that resonates through the centuries. The parents of this child were wealthy, since they could afford to mummify their child, and they were likely heartbroken at their loss.""This was certainly a loved child,"" says Hildebolt, ""for the family to go to the cost, trouble and time to have him mummified.""But the investigation also left some questions unanswered. Since the bones showed no injury, the team still does not know the cause of death. At first the skull seemed a bit enlarged, possibly due to hydrocephaly, but Don's measurements proved it was within the normal range. And who were the parents? Would further testing corroborate the mummy's time period?With funding from the SLSC, university researchers sent another swatch of wrapping to a laboratory for radiocarbon dating; with 95 percent certainty, the results showed a close match. This baby lived sometime between 40 BC and 130 AD, at the end of the Macedonian-Egyptian period of control and the beginning of Roman rule under Caesar Augustus.""So this child could easily have been alive at the same time as Cleopatra, Marc Antony, Julius Caesar and Octavian,"" says Hildebolt.To trace the baby's roots, they contacted Washington University geneticist Anne M. Bowcock, PhD, who enlisted researcher Li Cao, MD, to help retrieve and analyze DNA. This process was fraught with problems. For one thing, they needed to find uncontaminated DNA, deep inside the body. For another, the mummy was rock hard, yet they didn't want to damage it. Using instruments designed for spinal punctures, they bored into its bone through existing holes in the skin, extracting samples from several sites.Targeting the mitochondrial DNA, they amplified and sequenced their samples, checking the results with Douglas C. Wallace, PhD, of the University of California-Irvine, a mitochondrial expert. Next came a major surprise: This kind of DNA, provided by the maternal side, showed that this child's mother came of European lineage — perhaps a Roman or Greek living in Egypt. So far, the researchers have not been able to amplify the child's nuclear DNA, which would show the father's lineage.More questions linger, but the ""Child Mummy,"" as the SLSC calls it, has generated an excited response from visitors, who have flocked to the new permanent exhibit.The respectful treatment given this long-ago child also pleases Ikram. ""I am delighted with the results,"" she says, ""and feel that the ancient Egyptians would have been, too."""	2015/09/17	snopes

In the aftermath of the Islamic State attack that killed 130 people in Paris, he’s claimed—without evidence of truth—that “thousands” of Muslims were cheering the 9/11 attacks on rooftops in New Jersey, and he’s seemed to suggest that he would support a registry of all Muslims in the U.S. And just days after the attack by two apparently-radicalized terrorists in San Bernadino, Trump has tried to outflank his Republican rivals, most of whom have called for rejecting refugees fleeing Syria because of security concerns.Yet Trump’s constitutionally-questionable call to place an explicit religious test on immigration and travel goes far beyond his previous statements.For one, this was not an off-the-cuff remark, a response to a vague question, or even an idle retweet. Trump detailed his new position in a written statement sent to hundreds if not thousands of reporters covering the campaign. And it apparently extends beyond immigrants to Muslim-American citizens living overseas. It includes “everyone,” Hope Hicks, a campaign spokeswoman, told The Hill .“Without looking at the various polling data, it is obvious to anybody the hatred is beyond comprehension. Where this hatred comes from and why we will have to determine,” Trump said in his initial statement.Until we are able to determine and understand this problem and the dangerous threat it poses, our country cannot be the victims of horrendous attacks by people that believe only in Jihad, and have no sense of reason or respect for human life.The statement amounts to a sharp rebuke of President Obama’s plea, delivered in an Oval Office address on Sunday night, that the nation “reject discrimination” against Muslims. “It is our responsibility to reject religious tests on who we admit into this country,” Obama said. “It’s our responsibility to reject proposals that Muslim Americans should somehow be treated differently. Because when we travel down that road, we lose.""Trump’s call for a ban on Muslim immigration and travel drew swift and angry responses from candidates in both parties, as well as the White House.. @realdonaldtrump removes all doubt: he is running for President as a fascist demagogue.— Martin O'Malley (@MartinOMalley) December 7, 2015Condemnations from Republicans quickly followed. Jeb Bush tweeted that Trump had become “unhinged.” John Kasich said Trump’s “outrageous divisiveness” was more reason why he was “entirely unsuited” to be president. Senator Lindsey Graham, a long-shot Republican rival, tweeted that Trump had “gone from making absurd comments to being downright dangerous with his bombastic rhetoric.”He’s putting at risk the lives of interpreters, American supporters, diplomats, & the troops in the region by making these bigoted comments— Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) December 7, 2015Another Senate Republican, Jeff Flake of Arizona, wrote that “just when you think [Trump] can stoop no lower, he does.” The White House responded on Twitter by posting a quote, in all-caps, of Obama’s call to rejected religious tests.Of the immediate Republican candidate reactions, it was Trump’s closest competitor in Iowa, Ted Cruz, who had the mildest response. “That is not my policy,” he reportedly said in South Carolina, before repeating his preference for a three-year moratorium on refugees coming from countries with an ISIS or al Qaeda presence.The survey that Trump cited, by a D.C. think tank started by a former adviser to Ronald Reagan, was repudiated by a group at Georgetown University that tracks Islamophobia. “This survey should not be taken seriously,” the organization wrote in June after the survey was cited by Bill O’Reilly on Fox News.It comes from an organization with a history of producing dubious claims and “studies” about the threat of shariah, and was administered using an unreliable methodology. Its proponents seize upon its shoddy findings, exaggerating and misrepresenting them to American audiences, and falsely claim that the survey data represents the views of Muslims nationwide.Trump’s call for banning all Muslim immigrants came hours after a Monmouth University survey found that the GOP frontrunner is now trailing Ted Cruz in the important early-voting state of Iowa. The poll-obsessed Trump ignored that survey and instead tweeted a different Iowa poll showing him in the lead.We want to hear what you think about this article.

During the years of Japanese Occupation of North Korea, many of the future leaders fled to the Soviet Union. During World War II many if not close to all party leaders and KPA commanders served in the Soviet Army and as such adopted many of the Soviet Awards criteria for their own. During the late 1940s and until the Sino-Soviet Split in late 1958, orders and titles were made in the Soviet Money Mints in Moscow or Leningrad. Soviet made awards were modeled after Soviet orders and made of Sterling Silver. Initially the Orders were attached to clothing with a screw-plate, but after Soviet production stopped, production was moved to North Korea. The Screwback was replaced with a pin and the silver content was replaced by cheap tin. With the exception of a few examples of modern orders, Soviet and Czech KPA awards are the most sought after in current militaria markets. The ""Hero of the Republic"" was the highest award of the Democratic People's Republic Of Korea until the Order of Kim Il-Sung was established in 1972. Awarded for extreme heroic exploits during war. The recipient is also awarded with the Order of the National Flag 1st Class which was the nation's highest Order until the Order of Kim Il-Sung Along with the Gold Star and Order the Recipient is also honoured with the erection of a personal statue at their birthplace. This award is based upon the Soviet award ""Hero of the Soviet Union"". This title was the highest civilian award until the establishment of the Order of Kim Il-Sung in 1972. Awarded for exceptional merit and efficiency in professional labour. The recipient of this title was also awarded the Order of the National Flag 1st Class which was also the nation's highest order until the Order of Kim Il-Sung This award is based upon the Soviet award ""Hero of Socialist Labour"". The Order of Kim Il-sung is the highest decoration of the country. It is awarded for contributions to the revolution or upholding the dignity of the country home or abroad. It is usually awarded around April 15 (Day of the Sun, the birthday of Kim Il-sung). Kim Jong-il was its first recipient. With the issuance of Decree 2150 by the Presidium of the Supreme People's Assembly on February 3, 2012, the Order of Kim Jong-il was created for the 70th anniversary of his birth. The order measures 67mm in length and 65mm in width. It features the portrait of Kim Jong-il in the center of golden ear of rice above a shining five-point star, the flag of the DPRK below and the emblem of the Workers' Party of Korea above with an engraving of ""Order of Kim Jong-il"" on the back with pin and serial number. It is made to give commendation to officials, service personnel, working people, military units, organs, enterprises, and organizations who made distinguished services for the DPRK. The order ribbon is similar to the Order of Kim Il-sung in the color and the star at the center, but its design is different. Until the creation of the Order of Kim Il-sung in 1972, the highest order of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. The ONF was based on the awarding criteria as the Soviet Order of the Badge of Honor. Order ribbon has 2 gold stripes indicating 2nd Class. Order ribbon has 3 small gold stripes indicating 3rd Class. For efficient and meritorious professional labour. Conferred to flag officers and navy commanders for outstanding leadership. Conferred to flag officers and navy commanders for outstanding leadership. The original screwplate or pin back awards were given to Division, Corp or Army field commanders for achievement in battle. The medal was awarded to commanders in both the KPA and the PLA. During the Reign of Kim Jong Il, the award became a necktie style and given for more political reasons then battle. Awarded to Regiment or lower formation commanders for skill in battle. Much like the 1st Class version it was awarded for actions during the Korean War to both Chinese and Korean soldiers. Current, it has since been changed to a necktie version and has lost its battlefield prestige. Awarded only to Non-Nationals. Awarded only to Non-Nationals.

This order could be awarded to an individual up to three times, especially if he/she is a veteran or retired officer or NCO of the KPA in recognition of services given to the country. This order was awarded only once per recipient and dated 1968.9.9. on the reverse. Awarded to people who helped found the DPRK in 1948 as well as those who contributed to national defense, development and progress in the past 20 years. This commemorative order was issued on the 30th and 40th anniversaries of the foundation of the DPRK. It was only awarded a maximum of twice to a single recipient.

I’m 18 years old, Cuban and bisexual. I’m so indecisive that I can’t pick a favorite color, and I’m allergic to 12 things. I draw, paint, crochet, sew, embroider—anything productive I can do with my hands while watching Netflix.But none of this matters anymore.Advertisement - Continue Reading BelowWhat matters is that the majority of American people have become complacent in a senseless injustice that occurs all around them. What matters is that most American politicians have become more easily swayed by money than by the people who voted them into office. What matters is that my friends are dead, along with hundreds upon hundreds of others all over the United States.Emma pictured at a Valentine’s Day event at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, an hour before the shooting on February 14Rain ValladaresThis started with, has been about, will always be for, all of us. And who are we? We are the people who died in the freshman building on Valentine’s Day at Douglas High, and the people who died in every mass shooting in U.S. history. We are everyone who has been shot at, grazed or pierced by bullets, terrorized by the presence of guns and gun violence in America. We are kids, we are parents, we are students, we are teachers. We are tired of practicing school shooter drills and feeling scared of something we should never have to think about. We are tired of being ignored. So we are speaking up for those who don’t have anyone listening to them, for those who can’t talk about it just yet, and for those who will never speak again. We are grieving, we are furious, and we are using our words fiercely and desperately because that’s the only thing standing between us and this happening again.I have talked so much in the past few days that sometimes I feel like I might have used up all my words and I’ll never speak again. And then I hear someone say something really stupid and I can barely keep myself from snapping in two.Advertisement - Continue Reading BelowWe are children who are being expected to act like adults, while the adults are proving themselves to behave like children“If you have ever lost someone very important to you, then you already know how it feels, and if you haven't, then you cannot possibly imagine it,” wrote Lemony Snicket in The Bad Beginning: A Series of Unfortunate Events. There are people who do not know, and will never know, what it feels like to go through this. For that I am eternally thankful. But to the people out there who disagree with us: if you have ever felt what it's like to deal with all of this, you would know we aren’t doing this for attention. If these funerals were for your friends, you would know this grief is real, not paid for. We are children who are being expected to act like adults, while the adults are proving themselves to behave like children.When did children become such a dirty word? Adults are saying that children are lazy, meanwhile Jaclyn Corin organized an entire trip to Tallahassee, three busses stuffed with 100 kids and reporters who went to discuss our pitiful firearm legislation with the people who can—but won’t—do something about it.Adults are saying that children are emotional. I should hope so—some of our closest friends were taken before their time because of a senseless act of violence that should never have occurred. If we weren’t emotional, they would criticize us for that, as well. Adults are saying that children are disrespectful. But how can we respect people who don’t respect us? We have always been told that if we see something wrong, we need to speak up; but now that we are, all we're getting is disrespect from the people who made the rules in the first place. Adults like us when we have strong test scores, but they hate us when we have strong opinions.Advertisement - Continue Reading BelowAdvertisement - Continue Reading BelowI’m constantly torn between being thankful for the endless opportunities to share my voice, and wishing I were a tree so that I’d never have had to deal with this in the first place. I’d like to think that it would be nice to be a tree.Adults like us when we have strong test scores, but they hate us when we have strong opinionsStill, if I’m able to communicate one thing to adults, it would be this: it should not be easier to purchase a gun than it is to obtain a driver’s license, and military-grade weapons should not be accessible in civilian settings. You don’t drive a NASCAR on the street, no matter how fun it might be, just like you don’t need an AR-15 to protect yourself when walking home at night. No one does.Emma pictured last year during Pride week at schoolCourtesy of Emma GonzalezAt the end of the day, we don’t want people to have their guns taken away. We just want the people to be more responsible. We want civilians to have to go through more rolls of red tape to get what they want, because if any of that tape can stop those who shouldn’t own a gun from owning a gun, then our government will have done something right. All we want to do is go back to school. But we want to know that when we walk onto campus, we won’t have to worry about the possibility of staring down the barrel of a gun. We want to fix this problem so it doesn’t occur again, but mostly we want people to forget about us once this is over. We want to go back to our lives and live them to the fullest in respect for the dead.Teachers do not need to be armed with guns to protect their classes, they need to be armed with a solid education in order to teach their classes. That’s the only thing that needs to be in their job description. People say metal detectors would help. Tell that to the kids who already have metal detectors at school and are still victims of gun violence. If you want to help arm the schools, arm them with school supplies, books, therapists, things they actually need and can make use of.One more thing. We want increased mental health care for all those who need it—including the angry, frustrated men who almost always commit these crimes. Mental illness and gun violence are not directly correlated, but when the two go hand in hand, Americans—often children—lose their lives. We don't need the NRA's excuses, we need the NRA to finally stand up and use its power to supply the American people with something they deserve. (And please note, when members of the March for Our Lives movement talk about the NRA, we are referring to the organization itself, not the members. Many of the members understand and support our fight for responsible gun ownership, despite the organization preventing common sense gun laws from being instituted in the name of protecting the second amendment—rather than the American people.)Advertisement - Continue Reading BelowSo march with us on March 24.

The tears soaking Cristy's face were not the first she'd cried since her baby boy's complicated delivery on December 11th. She had been induced four days prior to his birth and struggled through 53 hours of labor. By the time he began to crown, not even Cristy's determination could overcome her exhaustion. The doctor told her to stop pushing.We don't know why the doctor didn't elect to perform a c-section earlier on. We don't know if her decision to use suction during the final moments of Dakota's birth was a wise one. What we know is that immediately after delivery, he began suffering one seizure after another.The small-town North Dakota hospital wasn't equipped to care for the newborn, so they life-flighted him to a hospital in the state's capital of Bismarck. His worried dad and even his exhausted mom left the hospital immediately and drove to Bismarck to be with their baby boy.A neurologist discovered Dakota's skull was fractured and bleeding in the brain was soon detected. The doctors have since learned that the bleeding is coming from a place deeper in the brain than initially thought.The good news amidst all of this heartache is that Dakota is showing himself to be a fighter! Today, instead of receiving sustenance through a feeding tube as he has been since birth, Dakota nursed (and nursed and nursed...!). This was the first time his mom was able to hold him.The road ahead to health is long. It would help so much if his parents could stay together in Bismarck until Dakota can come home with them. That means time off work, the added expense of staying in a town far from home and family support--not to mention the cost of medical care and the life flight, which goes far above and beyond what their medical insurance provides.Any financial help you can give this sweet, young family would be a tremendous blessing. As we learn more about Dakota's health, we will update this site, so you can keep Dakota, Cristy and Bobby in your thoughts and prayers.Thank you,"	2015/02/27	snopes

The report suggested that Cambridge Analytica had essentially issued questionnaires through a third party; those questionnaires, which were personality quizzes, requested that you use your Facebook login. Cambridge Analytica then compiled data regarding those who completed the quiz and cross-referenced that data with political preferences in order to target potential voters.This isn’t particularly shocking. In 2012, The Guardian reported that President Obama’s reelection team was “building a vast digital data operation that for the first time combines a unified database on millions of Americans with the power of Facebook to target individual voters to a degree never achieved before.” ADVERTISEMENTWhat, exactly, would Obama be doing? According to The Guardian, Obama’s new database would be gathered by asking individual volunteers to log into Obama’s reelection site using their Facebook credentials. “Consciously or otherwise,” The Guardian states, “the individual volunteer will be injecting all the information they store publicly on their Facebook page — home location, date of birth, interests and, crucially, network of friends — directly into the central Obama database.” Facebook had no problem with such activity then. They do now. There’s a reason for that. The former Obama director of integration and media analytics stated that, during the 2012 campaign, Facebook allowed the Obama team to “suck out the whole social graph”; Facebook “was surprised we were able to suck out the whole social graph, but they didn’t stop us once they realized that was what we were doing.” She added , “They came to [the] office in the days following election recruiting & were very candid that they allowed us to do things they wouldn’t have allowed someone else to do because they were on our side.”Not so with Trump. As soon as Facebook realized that Cambridge Analytica had pursued a similar strategy, they suspended the firm.Again, this isn’t surprising. Since Trump’s election, Democrats — in search of a rationale for their favored candidate’s defeat — have blamed a bevy of social media outlets. Senate Democrats trotted out pathetic Russian-created memes on Facebook, viewed by a handful of human beings, as an excuse for Hillary’s loss; Democrats claimed — without evidence — that “fake news” had swamped Facebook and thus led to Trump’s victory. Democrats have also insisted that Facebook be regulated. Sen.

Or we will.” Facebook’s former privacy manager called for the government to step into an oversight role regarding Facebook.In February, Wired magazine ran a cover story specifically dealing with Facebook’s role in the election of 2016, and their subsequent attempts to “fix” the problem.

And in February, Zuckerberg said he wanted to re-jigger the algorithms on his platform to benefit content that Facebook deems “trustworthy, informative, and local.” Wired celebrated: “You can’t make the world more open and connected if you’re breaking it apart.”The result of Facebook’s algorithmic changes: conservatives have been slammed. And that’s the point. A study from The Western Journal found that conservative sites have lost an average of 14 percent of their Facebook traffic; leftist sites saw a minor increase. Even major publications saw that effect: The New York Daily News saw a bump of 24.18 percent, while the New York Post dropped 11.44 percent.And that’s the goal in covering Cambridge Analytica, and Russian interference on Twitter, and all the rest — even without any serious information suggesting that such interference shifted votes, the left can rest assured that its Silicon Valley allies will act to de-platform Republicans and conservatives. There’s a reason Twitter has suspended alt-right racists but continued to recommend that others follow Louis Farrakhan; there’s a reason YouTube is being sued by Prager University; there’s a reason Google used automatic fact-checking on right-wing sites but did no such thing for left-wing sites.We’re in the midst of a radical reshifting in social media. Ironically, the people who have stumped against regulation — conservatives — are those being targeted by social media companies. If companies like Facebook, YouTube, Google and Twitter don’t start acting like platforms again rather than like motivated left-wing outlets, Republicans likely won’t let principle outweigh practicality for long.Ben Shapiro ( @BenShapiro ), a lawyer and conservative commentator, is founder and editor in chief of The Daily Wire .

https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/saudi-arabia-eases-guardianship-rules-against-women/	saudi arabian king salman has issued an order allowing women more access to services.	Mostly True	['human rights watch', ' saudi arabia']	http://www.reuters.com/	http://www.reuters.com/article/us-saudi-women-idUSKBN1811QN	2017/05/25	May 5, 2017 / 3:35 PM / a year agoSaudi step to relax male guardianship welcomed by women's advocatesHeba Kanso3 Min ReadBEIRUT (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - A move by Saudi Arabia to give women more control over their life choices by further relaxing a controversial male guardian system was tentatively welcomed on Friday as another small step for women in the conservative kingdom.Saudi Arabia is well known as one of the world’s most gender-segregated nations, where women live under the supervision of a male guardian, cannot drive, and in public must wear head-to-toe black garments.Women need approval from a man to travel, study and get some health treatments.However local media outlets reported this week that the king of Saudi Arabia has issued an order allowing women to benefit from government services such as education and healthcare without getting the consent of a male guardian.This means women could, in some circumstances, study and access hospital treatment, work in the public and private sector and represent themselves in court without consent of a male guardian, said Maha Akeel, a women’s rights campaigner and a director at Jeddah-based Organization of Islamic Cooperation.“Now at least it opens the door for discussion on the guardian system,” Akeel told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. “Women are independent and can take care of themselves.”This comes as the latest in a series of moves in Saudi Arabia to include women more in the workforce as the kingdom moves to diversify its economy and cut reliance on oil.The trend started in 2011 when the late King Abdullah allowed women onto the government advisory Shura Council. Women can now vote in municipal elections, work in some retail and hospitality jobs and were allowed to compete in the Olympics for the first time in 2012.However Saudi Arabia was still ranked 141 of 144 countries in the 2016 Global Gender Gap, a World Economic Forum study on how women fare in economic and political participation, health and education.The system of make guardianship, which requires women to obtain permission from a guardian - father, husband, or son - to travel, study or marry is an impediment to realizing women’s rights, say rights groups.“Male guardianship is un-Islamic and humiliating for women,” said Akeel. “Some (men) take advantage of this male guardianship for their own benefit and abuse it.”Reporting by Heba Kanso @hebakanso, Editing by Belinda Goldsmith and Ros Russell; Please credit Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm of Thomson Reuters, that covers humanitarian news, women’s rights, trafficking, property rights, and climate change.

https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/harvard-study-apple-iphones-sales-slows/	a harvard study proved that apple purposely slows down its older model iphones to coincide with device releases and to boost sales of new models.	Mixture	['apple', ' daily mail', ' iphone', ' not actually a study']	https://www.geekbench.com/	https://www.geekbench.com/blog/2017/12/iphone-performance-and-battery-age/	2017/09/22	iPhone Performance and Battery AgePublishedDec 18, 2017by John PooleA Reddit post from last week has sparked a discussion regarding iPhone performance as a function of battery age. While we expect battery capacity to decrease as batteries age, we expect processor performance to stay the same. However, users with older iPhones with lower-than-expected Geekbench 4 scores have reported that replacing the battery increases their score (as well as the performance of the phone). What’s going on here? How many phones are experiencing decreased Geekbench 4 score?To answer these questions I’ve plotted the kernel density of Geekbench 4 single-core scores for the iPhone 6s and the iPhone 7 running different versions of iOS. Scores obtained in low-power mode are not included in the distribution.iPhone 6sHere are the charts for the iPhone 6s:The distribution of iPhone 6s scores for iOS 10.2.0 appears unimodal with a peak around the average score. However, the distribution of iPhone 6s scores for iOS 10.2.1 appears multimodal, with one large peak around the average and several smaller peaks around lower scores. Under iOS 11.2.0 the effect is even more pronounced.iPhone 7Here are the charts for the iPhone 7:The distribution of iPhone 7 scores under iOS 10.2.0, iOS 10.2.1, and iOS 11.1.2 appears identical. However, the distribution changes with iOS 11.2.0 and starts to look like the iPhone 6s distribution from 10.2.1.Performance and Battery AgeSo what’s going on here?First, it appears the problem is widespread, and will only get worse as phones (and their batteries) continue to age. See, for example, the difference between the distribution of iPhone 6s scores between 10.2.1 and 11.2.0.Second, the problem is due, in part, to a change in iOS. The difference between 10.2.0 and 10.2.1 is too abrupt to be just a function of battery condition. I believe (as do others) that Apple introduced a change to limit performance when battery condition decreases past a certain point. Why did Apple do this? kadupse on Reddit offers the following explanation:Many iPhone 6s devices were shutting down unexpectedly, even after the battery replacement program (Which many people weren’t entitled to use). Because degraded batteries last much less and end up with a lower voltage Apple’s solution was to scale down CPU performance, it doesn’t solve anything and is a bad experience… but it’s better than having your device shutdown at 40% when you need it the most.Apple acknowledged the sudden shutdown issue that affected the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6s earlier this year. However, does the same issue affect the iPhone 7? Apple appears to have added a similar change to iOS 11.2.0 for the iPhone 7.If the performance drop is due to the “sudden shutdown” fix, users will experience reduced performance without notification. Users expect either full performance, or reduced performance with a notification that their phone is in low-power mode. This fix creates a third, unexpected state. While this state is created to mask a deficiency in battery power, users may believe that the slow down is due to CPU performance, instead of battery performance, which is triggering an Apple introduced CPU slow-down. This fix will also cause users to think, “my phone is slow so I should replace it” not, “my phone is slow so I should replace its battery”. This will likely feed into the “planned obsolescence” narrative.John Poole is the Founder of Primate Labs and lives in Toronto, Ontario.Products	2017/12/18	snopes

But I can’t feed my family with satisfaction,” said Dr Hetfield. “So I figured if Brian May could do it, so could I. Which is why I did this other gig. Turns out, I was pretty good at it.”And what exactly was his dissertation about? It built on Dr Misty Benz’s 2007 work on black holes and distant quasars by improving light refactoring and the effects of gravity on the Hubble telescope. The study has helped create a crucial breakthrough in the field.“So that’s the thing,” added Dr Hetfield. “I analyzed micro-lensing in gravitationally lensed quasars to yield measurements of the structure of their continuum emission regions. I first described our lensed quasar monitoring program and RETROCAM, the auxiliary port camera I built for the 2.4m Hiltner telescope to monitor lensed quasars. I know it seems obvious, but the math wasn’t playing out quite right.”Yes. We completely understood what you just said, Dr Hetfield!As for his music career, the iconic musician has no plans on quitting, as he plans to do both. “We have a lot of downtime on the road and I can work on my equations there.“Besides, I’m making the rest of the band call me ‘The Doctor’ from now on.

Trump's highly anticipated foreign policy speech Wednesday will test whether the Republican presidential front-runner, known for his raucous rallies and eyebrow-raising statements, can present a more presidential persona as he works to unite the GOP establishment behind him. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci)The Donald Trump campaign continued railing against the judge who is presiding over the fraud case against the mogul’s university, linking his past membership in a Latino lawyers’ group as a reason to doubt his objectivity.Trump spokeswoman Katrina Pierson on Monday said that Judge Gonzalo Curiel had been member of a group that has been overtly against her candidate.""I think what's really interesting about this particular judge — as Mr. Trump refers to him as a 'Trump hater' — is he even mentions on his judicial questionnaire that he was a La Raza Lawyers Association member,"" Pierson said in an interview on CNN.Trump has been trying to get Curiel off the fraud case against Trump University since 2014.At a campaign rally on Friday in San Diego, Trump denounced Curiel’s handling of the case, which involves two class action suits that accuse Trump University of deceptive practices against customers who were promised insight into the mogul’s strategies for succeeding in real estate.The lawsuit overseen by Curiel states that Trump University's nationwide seminars and classes were like infomercials and pressured students to buy more but didn't deliver as promised in spite of students paying as much as $35,000 for seminars.The Washington Post reported that Curiel's order to release an estimated 1,000 pages of Trump University-related documents cites heightened public interest in Trump and that he had ""placed the integrity of these court proceedings at issue."" The judge appeared to reject the argument by Trump attorneys that the information had commercial value, saying that there was no support for the assertion that Trump University may resume operations.Trump assailed the judge’s scheduling for a trial to begin in November. The candidate already was displeased with Curiel's decision last year to accept the court complaints against Trump University as class-action suits.""The trial is going to take place sometime in November,” Trump said at the rally. “There should be no trial. This should have been dismissed on summary judgment easily, everybody says it. But I have a judge who is a hater of Donald Trump, a hater. He's a hater.”""The judge, who happens to be, we believe, Mexican, which is great. I think that's fine.""It was the second time this year Trump tried to link the judge's ethnicity to his ability to be impartial in the case. In February, Trump said in an interview on ""Meet the Press"" that Curiel's Hispanic heritage was a reason the judge was not ruling in his favor in the case.The judge was born and raised in Indiana. His parents came from Mexico, according to various published reports.Pierson defended Trump’s comments, which many later criticized as unfair and bigoted, saying the judge’s ethnicity was irrelevant and should not have been singled out. She also questioned the judge’s involvement with the National Council of La Raza, a national civil rights group.""This is an organization that has been out there organizing anti-Trump protesters with the Mexican flags,” Pierson said, “they are pushing it. The signs have been very apparent. And so Mr. Trump is just stating the obvious.""Trump has attacked Mexico as a country that dumps drug dealers and other criminals along the U.S.-Mexico border. A cornerstone of his campaign has been that he will crack down on illegal immigration. He has vowed to build a huge wall that he says he will force Mexico to fund, and also has vowed to have a mass deportation to expel the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants living in the United States.The CNN interviewer told Pierson that the judge is American-born.Pierson said she was not sure of his ethnic origin, but argued that it was relevant.""Well, it's because of what we see outside of these rallies, these anti-Trump rallies, these criminal rallies, these criminal protesters out there defacing property and attacking police officers,"" Pierson said. ""They're doing so under the guise of an anti-Trump protest, with their Mexican flags, and La Raza and this judge is connected to that.""Curiel is not permitted to address Trump’s attacks.He has said only that during the civil case against Trump University, the mogul has become a leading presidential candidate who “placed the integrity of these court proceedings at issue.”Earlier in his career, Curiel prosecuted drug smugglers and cartel leaders, a mission that made him a target of assassination attempts and required him to live under tight security.In 1997, for example, a gunman for a Tijuana drug cartel spoke in a bugged conversation of being willing and able to arranged Curiel’s murder, according a Los Angeles Times story from that year.A 2002 New York Times story credited Curiel with being one of the key figures in one of the U.S.’s most important victories in the fight against drug smuggling across the border.As a chief drug prosecutor in the late 1990’s, Curiel and other law enforcement officials in California of Mexican descent were able to use their Spanish-language skills and knowledge of the culture to win the trust of their police counterparts in Mexico and identify the corrupt officials who were sabotaging U.S.-Mexico efforts to crack down on the drug cartels.“According to participants on both sides, the Mexicans looked across the table at Mr. Chavez, Mr. Vega and Mr. Curiel, all born of Mexican parents, and the spark of recognition lit a fire,” the Times story said.''It couldn't but help,'' Mr. Curiel said to the Times in 2002. ''We were working without the disconnect of interpreters and barriers of culture. When it comes down to it, this involves the country of our parents.''The Associated Press contributed to this report.Like us on FacebookFollow us on Twitter & InstagramTrending in Politics"	2016/05/31	snopes

(Photo by Rachel Leingang, Arizona Capitol Times)One man is behind bars after activists halted todays House floor session with chanting, jeering and a tussle with police.Activists, stoked by rowdy proceedings in the House Elections Committee earlier in the day, filled the gallery.They had arrived in the morning to attend the committee hearing where election officials explained what went wrong with the March 22 election in which many voters waited in line for hours. The hearing was cut short so lawmakers could attend the floor session.The trouble started as lawmakers began reciting the Pledge of Allegiance.Adriana Espinoza, an activist sitting directly behind the main agitator, said a small group in unison added their own ending to the pledge by saying in liberty and justice for some.She said that prompted security to start pointing out disruptive people.Elizabeth Brown, a state Senate candidate who attended the hearing earlier, said one man was the most disruptive, chanting re-vote, but he left without incident when asked.Espinoza and Brown said a security official pointed out a man in a Guy Fawkes mask and wearing dreadlocks as an agitator, but they said he sat quietly as the main agitator led chants.Officers run toward the House of Representatives on March 28, 2016, after chaos in the House gallery. (Photo by Gary Grado, Arizona Capitol Times)The man with the mask refused to leave and when police put their hands on him he clutched onto his chair. Those around him started screaming that the police were out of line, and later that the police were choking him.Eventually DPS officers were able to pry him loose.Department of Public Safety Captain Damon Cecil said the Houses Sergeant of Arms wanted the man in the mask to leave and asked troopers to remove him.Cecil said he was yelling different slogans and was warned, but continued to be disruptive.Cecil also said its the Sergeant at Arms who decides who should be removed.The man will be booked into Maricopa County jail on suspicion of resisting arrest and trespassing, Cecil said.Cecil disagreed with witnesses who said the man wasnt disruptive.If he was peaceful, why wouldnt he just leave? Cecil said.No one was injured in the chaos.Share this:Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window)Click to print (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)Click to share on LinkedIn (Opens in new window)Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window)	2016/03/28	snopes
