DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE SENDS 25 ADVISORS TO IRAQ IN SUPPORT OF<br/>
PROVISIONAL AUTHORITY EFFORT TO RECONSTRUCT CRIMINAL SYSTEM<br/>
</u></b></p>
<br/>
<p>
<b>WASHINGTON, D.C.</b> - Attorney General John Ashcroft announced today that 
the Department of Justice, through the Office of Overseas Prosecutorial 
Development, Assistance and Training (OPDAT) and International Criminal 
Investigation Training Assistance Program (ICITAP), has sent 25 career, 
criminal justice practitioners as advisors to Iraq to assist in the 
reconstruction of the judicial, prosecutorial and law enforcement sectors in 
the country. OPDAT sent a team of 13 judicial officials, including judges, 
prosecutors, public defenders and court administrators. ICITAP sent a team of 
12 law enforcement professionals, including police officials and correctional 
experts. They are joined by senior criminal justice sector officials from 
Canada, Denmark and the United Kingdom. </p>
<p>
The advisors will assist the Department of Defense, Office of Reconstruction 
and Humanitarian Assistance (ORHA). The Department of State, Bureau for 
International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL), will provide 
logistical and other support to the DOJ-led international team and is actively 
engaged in the effort to restore law and order in Iraq. INL has assigned a 
senior officer to serve as advisor to the Iraqi Minister of the Interior; will 
assist in standing up an Iraqi national civilian police force within existing 
structures; will coordinate training, advisory services, equipment and 
facility reconstruction as needed, based upon the results of the DOJ-led 
assessment; and is coordinating offers of assistance from other governments to 
rebuild the criminal justice sector in Iraq. </p>
<p>
“For decades, a fortunate few Iraqis have escaped the reign of Saddam 
Hussein's tyranny and fear to find freedom in the United States,” said 
Attorney General Ashcroft. “Now, all Iraqis can taste liberty in their native 
land, and we will help make that freedom permanent by assisting them to 
establish an equitable criminal justice system, based on the rule of law and 
standards of basic human rights.” </p>
<p>
The primary goals of the teams will be making initial assessments of the Iraqi 
judicial and law enforcement sectors; providing recommendations regarding the 
reestablishment of criminal justice institutions; as well as participating in 
the development of a strategic, long-range, sustainable plan for policing, 
prosecutions, corrections and court systems. </p>
<p>
Justice personnel from OPDAT and ICITAP, along with their international 
counterparts, will provide assistance and expert, practical advice to the 
people and institutions of Iraq, but the Iraqis will make the choices of 
accepting which options will become final standards for the criminal justice 
system. The end result of the two programs will be the permanent transition of 
all judicial sector, civilian police and correctional operations to Iraqi 
control, leaving a sustainable infrastructure to maintain order, human rights 
and rule of law. </p>
