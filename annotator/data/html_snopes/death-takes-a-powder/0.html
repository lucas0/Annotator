<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
              first and most primitive method of recording television programs, 
              production, or news story, a kinescope is a film made of a live 
              television broadcast. Kinescopes are usually created by placing 
              a motion picture camera in front of a television monitor and recording 
              the image off the monitor's screen while the program is being aired. 
              This recording method came into wide use around 1947. Before videotape, 
              this process was the standard industry method of creating a permanent 
              document, for rebroadcast and for archival purposes. The term "kinescope" 
              comes from the combination of two words: the Greek "kinetic," meaning 
              of or related to motion, and "scope," as in an observational instrument 
              such as a microscope. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Actually, 
              kinescope is the name for the cathode ray tube in a television receiver 
              which translates electrical signals into a picture on a lighted 
              screen. The use of the word "kinescope" to describe a filmed recording 
              of a television broadcast was derived from this piece of equipment. 
              Originally they were called "kinescope recordings" but, due to repeated 
              usage in spoken language, the term was usually shorted to just "kinescope," 
              and then often shortened again to just "kine" or "kinne." The picture 
              quality created by kinescopes was admittedly and understandably 
              poor--they appeared grainy, fuzzy, even distorted--yet they were 
              the only method for documentation available to stations and producers 
              at that time. Though their poor picture quality generally prohibited 
              any extensive reuse, many programs were rebroadcast from kinescope 
              in order to save money, allow them to be broadcast at a different 
              time or, more frequently, to expose the programs to a wider audience. 
              Cities and locales outside of an antenna's reach and without wire 
              or cable connection, had no way of seeing programming produced in 
              and broadcast from New York City, programming which constituted 
              the majority of television at the time. In order for a program to 
              be seen in outlying areas (either beyond the city limits or elsewhere 
              across the country), kinescope films were shipped from station to 
              station in a practice known as "bicycling."</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
              For many stations the airing of kinescopes (despite the very poor 
              picture quality) was a necessary way to fill the programming day. 
              This was especially true in the early days of educational television 
              which had high goals but little money to achieve them. Though kinescoped 
              programs could never be very timely they could be educational and, 
              in this case, they were the best way to fill a void. The National 
              Educational Television and Radio Center (later NET) in Ann Arbor, 
              Michigan was the country's largest clearinghouse for kinescope distribution 
              until the late 1950s.</font></p>

<td align="right" valign="top" width="332">
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Because 
              kinescopes were considered so unsatisfactory many companies early 
              on attempted to find more efficient, cost efficient and more aesthetically 
              pleasing methods of recording their programs. Singer Bing Crosby, 
              who was seeking a more convenient way of producing his television 
              specials without having to perform them live, had his company Bing 
              Crosby Enterprises operate and demonstrate the first magnetic videotape 
              recordings in 1951. The RCA and Ampex companies would also display 
              electronic videotape recording methods before the end of the decade 
              with the Ampex standard eventually being the adopted method of the 
              TV industry. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">But 
              the true demise of the kinescope (at least as far as entertainment 
              programming is concerned), like most things in television, was ultimately 
              driven by an economic concerns and can be attributed to <i>I Love 
              Lucy</i> and its stars and producers Desi Arnaz and Lucille Ball. 
              When beginning their landmark show, the couple insisted on producing 
              in California, their home for many years. Philip Morris, the cigar 
              and cigarette manufacturer, already signed on as the show's sponsor, 
              wanted the program produced in New York because more potential smokers 
              lived east of the Mississippi: Philip Morris would not settle for 
              inferior kinescopes playing on the East Coast. In response Arnaz 
              and cinematographer Karl Freund devised a method of recording performances 
              on film. Their system used three cameras to record the live action 
              while a director switched among them to obtain the best shot or 
              angle. The show was later edited into the best performance in a 
              manner much like a feature film. The result not only was a superior 
              recording good for repeated airing throughout the country, it also 
              presaged the move of the TV industry from New York to the West Coast, 
              where fully equipped film studios eagerly entered television production 
              and recouped some of the losses they had encountered with the rise 
              of the new medium. Moreover, the new filmed product created, almost 
              accidentally, TV's most profitable byproduct, the rerun.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> 
              The kinescope, the one and perhaps only method of television recording 
              technology to be completely obsolete in the industry today, is now 
              of use only in archives and museums where the fuzzy, grainy texture 
              often only adds to their charm as artifacts and antiquities. Fortunately, 
              for those who would understand and present the history of television 
              programming, that charm ismatched by the historical value of even 
              this partial record of an era all but lost. </font></p>
