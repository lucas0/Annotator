The New York Post had a front page that was a picture of a
computer monitor on which was superimposed
"`NYC'=<img align="top" alt="[poison]" height="15" src="http://web.archive.org//web/19961119143115im_/http://www.sincity.com/penn-n-teller/pcc/wingding-N14.gif" width="10"/> <img align="top" alt="[Star of David]" height="15" src="http://web.archive.org//web/19961119143115im_/http://www.sincity.com/penn-n-teller/pcc/wingding-Y14.gif" width="12"/> <img align="top" alt="[thumbs up]" height="16" src="http://web.archive.org//web/19961119143115im_/http://www.sincity.com/penn-n-teller/pcc/wingding-C14.gif" width="12"/>."<tt> </tt>
The headline was, "Program of Hate." 
<p>
<em>Huh?</em>
</p><p>
If you type "NYC" in a certain <a href="#font">clip art font*</a> you get
"<img align="top" alt="[poison]" height="15" src="http://web.archive.org//web/19961119143115im_/http://www.sincity.com/penn-n-teller/pcc/wingding-N14.gif" width="10"/> <img align="top" alt="[Star of David]" height="15" src="http://web.archive.org//web/19961119143115im_/http://www.sincity.com/penn-n-teller/pcc/wingding-Y14.gif" width="12"/> <img align="top" alt="[thumbs up]" height="16" src="http://web.archive.org//web/19961119143115im_/http://www.sincity.com/penn-n-teller/pcc/wingding-C14.gif" width="12"/>."<tt> </tt>
According to the dumb as a
post, Post writer, Don Broderick, this is "a secret anti-semitic
message apparently urging death to Jews in New York City."<tt> </tt>
Don really did write it just like that.<tt> </tt> I didn't take it out of
context.<tt> </tt> There was no "could be," "might be," "kinda," "maybe,"
"I think," or "sorta."<tt> </tt> He states that it <em>is</em> a "secret
anti-<wbr>semitic message."<tt> </tt> What a jerk.
</wbr></p><p>
Some brain dead, mouth-breathing, computer consultant (remaining
nameless is probably the only smart thing this bottom-feeder did
in his whole wretched life) was installing a program for a
client, when he typed "NYC" while accidently in a clip art
character set.<tt> </tt> He got <nobr>"<img align="top" alt="[poison]" height="15" src="http://web.archive.org//web/19961119143115im_/http://www.sincity.com/penn-n-teller/pcc/wingding-N14.gif" width="10"/> <img align="top" alt="[Star of David]" height="15" src="http://web.archive.org//web/19961119143115im_/http://www.sincity.com/penn-n-teller/pcc/wingding-Y14.gif" width="12"/> <img align="top" alt="[thumbs up]" height="16" src="http://web.archive.org//web/19961119143115im_/http://www.sincity.com/penn-n-teller/pcc/wingding-C14.gif" width="12"/>."</nobr>
</p><p>
Now, there were many ways he could read the random rebus glowing
on his client's CRT: <em>My</em> first interpretation would be: "Hey,
numbskull, if you're really a computer consultant shouldn't you
know how to get <em>letters</em> instead of <em>clip art</em>
out of the keyboard? 
Maybe your real aptitude lies in a different profession, perhaps
something a little less high-tech, like <nobr>. . .</nobr> oh <nobr>. . .</nobr> let's say
<nobr>.  .  .</nobr> shepherd (I'm sure there's sheep accounting software and
very computer-literate shepherds but I'm equally sure that anyone
who's ever touched a sheep professionally has a sense of humor. 
We won't see the headline,<tt> </tt> "Message of Shepherd Hate by Two-bit
Magician in PC Computing" on the front page of "The Sheep
Examiner").
</p><p>
To me, <img align="top" alt="[poison]" height="15" src="http://web.archive.org//web/19961119143115im_/http://www.sincity.com/penn-n-teller/pcc/wingding-N14.gif" width="10"/> <img align="top" alt="[Star of David]" height="15" src="http://web.archive.org//web/19961119143115im_/http://www.sincity.com/penn-n-teller/pcc/wingding-Y14.gif" width="12"/> <img align="top" alt="[thumbs up]" height="16" src="http://web.archive.org//web/19961119143115im_/http://www.sincity.com/penn-n-teller/pcc/wingding-C14.gif" width="12"/>
means "Jewish people
make really good pesticides?"<tt> </tt> Isn't that a more valid
translation than this lamebrain's "message of hate?"
</p><p>
Brian Young, a shameless enough loser to claim to be a friend of
the anonymous fool who "discovered" this nonsense says, "there's
no way this could be coincidence."<tt> </tt> The Post says "Young
calculated the odds of three letters of the alphabet being
combined with 255 symbols and said he found that the odds of
obtaining the message were less than one in a trillion."
</p><p>
How does he get "less than one in a trillion?"<tt> </tt> Beats me.<tt> </tt> The
real odds are one in 16,581,375 (255<img align="top" alt="[cubed]" height="12" src="http://web.archive.org//web/19961119143115im_/http://www.sincity.com/penn-n-teller/pcc/wingding-cubed14.gif" width="4"/>).<tt> </tt> You can't even
<em>see</em> a trillion from 16 million.<tt> </tt>
And that's only if you think the
order of the symbols matters.<tt> </tt> I think once you're living off the
deep end <img alt="[Star of David]" height="15" src="http://web.archive.org//web/19961119143115im_/http://www.sincity.com/penn-n-teller/pcc/wingding-Y14.gif" width="12"/> <img align="top" alt="[thumbs up]" height="16" src="http://web.archive.org//web/19961119143115im_/http://www.sincity.com/penn-n-teller/pcc/wingding-C14.gif" width="12"/> <img align="top" alt="[poison]" height="15" src="http://web.archive.org//web/19961119143115im_/http://www.sincity.com/penn-n-teller/pcc/wingding-N14.gif" width="10"/> ,

This, however, is playing a nut's game - once you're crazy and
know nothing about numbers, the chances of finding something
psychotic and hateful in a scrabble factory explosion are
hovering just around 100%".
</p><p>
The real question is why would a Neo-Nazi hide his/her
psychopathic hate messages in ASCII numbers where only Brian and
his probably imaginary "friend" could find them?<tt> </tt> What does that
accomplish for the Aryan race?<tt> </tt> With the only slightly limited
freedom of speech in this country, Hitler Jr. could just state
his/her sick message outright on "Geraldo" - just like everyone
else.

There is so much hate, paranoia, and bad math in this whole thing
that I quit.<tt> </tt> ("QUIT," incidently comes out <img align="top" alt="[airplane] [cross] [hand held up] [snowflake]" height="15" src="http://web.archive.org//web/19961119143115im_/http://www.sincity.com/penn-n-teller/pcc/wingding-q14.gif" width="63"/>.<tt> </tt> This must mean "A plane carrying
