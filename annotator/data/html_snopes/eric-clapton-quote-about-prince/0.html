<p>Hi everybody.</p>
<p>About a week and a half ago, the server which listology lived on suffered a catastrophic failure.
    Through a perfect storm of circumstances far too lengthy and tedious to explain, I found myself without
    an easy backup from which to restore, and my hosting provider found themselves unable to restore my
    site from the weekly server images that they store every week. They continue to work on that problem,
    however at this point I don't have an enormous amount of confidence in their ability to succeed, and I
    have started to explore other options.</p>
<p>I do have a copy of the raw database files that Listology ran on, and I am going to attempt to get
    these up and running. However this could serve to be time consuming, and at the same time I am also hunting
    for a new hosting provider (I had been meaning to do this for some time actually, I greatly regret not having
    done it sooner.)</p>
<p>In the meantime, know that I have all your data and lists, and that one way or another we will get them
    back online. However, I do not have a timeline, and my work and personal lives are extremely busy right
    now. So keep patient, and Listology will return as soon as it can. In the meantime, if you have any questions
    or concerns, feel free to email me at gdd@listology.com (the email is hosted by Google and still functional.)</p>
<p>Thank you all for being such a fantastic community. I hope to see you all again very soon.</p>
<p>Greg Dunlap</p>
