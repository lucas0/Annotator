<p><b>On sterilization &amp; racial purification:</b><br/>
        Sanger believed that, for the purpose of racial
        "purification," couples should be rewarded who chose
        sterilization. <i>Birth Control in America, The Career of Margaret
        Sanger</i>, by David Kennedy, p. 117, quoting a 1923 Sanger speech.
        </p><p><b>On the right of married couples to bear children:</b><br/>
        Couples should be required to submit applications to have a child,
        she wrote in her "Plan for Peace." <i>Birth Control Review</i>,
        April 1932
        </p><p><b>On the purpose of birth control:</b><br/>
        The purpose in promoting birth control was "to create a race of
        thoroughbreds," she wrote in the<i> Birth Control Review</i>, Nov.
        1921 (p. 2)
        </p><p><b>On the rights of the handicapped and mentally ill, and racial
        minorities:</b><br/>
        "More children from the fit, less from the unfit -- that is the
        chief aim of birth control." <i>Birth Control Review</i>, May
        1919, p. 12</p>
<p><b>On religious convictions regarding sex outside of marriage:</b><br/>
        "This book aims to answer the needs expressed in thousands on thousands of letters to me in<img align="right" border="0" height="95" src="http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:uPwuwzXcZJQJ:www.dianedew.com/images/sanger3.jpg" width="75"/> the solution of marriage problems... Knowledge of sex truths frankly and plainly presented cannot possibly injure healthy, normal, young minds. Concealment, suppression, futile attempts to veil the unveilable - these work injury, as they seldom succeed and only render those who indulge in them ridiculous. For myself, I have full confidence in the cleanliness, the open-mindedness, the promise of the younger generation."
        Margaret Sanger, <i> Happiness in Marriage</i> (Bretano's, New York,
        1927) </p>
<p><b>On the extermination of blacks:</b><br/>
        "We do not want word to go out that we want to exterminate the Negro
        population," she said, "if it ever occurs to any of their more
        rebellious members." <i>Woman's Body, Woman's Right: A Social
        History of Birth Control in America</i>, by Linda Gordon
        </p><p><b>On respecting the rights of the mentally ill:</b><br/>
        In her "Plan for Peace," Sanger outlined her strategy for
        eradication of those she deemed "feebleminded." Among the
        steps included in her evil scheme were immigration restrictions;
        compulsory sterilization; segregation to a lifetime of farm work; etc. <i>Birth
        Control Review</i>, April 1932, p. 107
        </p><p><b>On adultery:</b><br/>
        A woman's physical satisfaction was more important than any marriage
        vow, Sanger believed. <i>Birth Control in America</i>, p. 11
        </p><p><b>On marital sex:</b><br/>
        "The marriage bed is the most degenerating influence in the
        social order," Sanger said. (p. 23) [Quite the opposite of God's
        view on the matter: "Marriage is honorable in all, and the bed
        undefiled; but whoremongers and adulterers God will judge."
        (Hebrews 13:4)</p>
<p><b>On abortion:</b><br/>
        "Criminal' abortions arise from a perverted sex relationship under
        the stress of economic necessity, and their greatest frequency is among
        married women." <i>The Woman Rebel - No Gods, No Masters,</i> May

<p> <b>On motherhood:</b><br/>
 "I cannot refrain from saying
        that women must come to recognize there is some

        Know</i>, by Margaret Sanger (Max Maisel, Publisher, 1915) [Jesus said: "Daughters of Jerusalem, weep... for your
        children. For, <i>behold, the days are coming, in which they shall

        <p>Founder of Planned Parenthood, the largest abortion provider in the
        world.</p>
<p><b>Her goal in life:</b><br/>
        Sanger admitted her entire life's purpose was to promote birth
        control. <i>An Autobiography</i>, p. 194</p>
<p>Helped to establish the research bureau that financed "the pill," she
        contributed toward the work of the German doctor who developed the IUD. "Ernst Graefenberg and His Ring," <i>Mt. Sinai Journal of
        Medicine</i>, July-Aug. 1975, p. 345, in <i>Margaret Sanger: Father of
        Modern Society</i>, by Elasah Drogin</p>
<p>Sanger espoused the thinking of eugenicists -- similar to Darwin's
        "survival of the fittest" -- but related the concept to human
        society, saying the genetic makeup of the poor, and minorities, for
        example, was inferior. <i>Pivot of Civilization</i>, by Margaret
        Sanger, 1922, p. 80</p><p><b>On mandatory sterilization of the poor:</b><br/>
        One of Sanger's greatest influences, sexologist/eugenicist Dr.
        Havelock Ellis (with whom she had an affair, leading to her divorce from
        her first husband), urged mandatory sterilization of the poor as a
        prerequisite to receiving any public aid. <i>The Problem of Race
        Regeneration</i>, by Havelock Ellis, p. 65, in <i>Margaret Sanger:
        Father of Modern Society</i>, p. 18.
        Ellis believed that any sex was acceptable, as long as it hurt no
        one. <i>The Sage of Sex, A Life of Havelock Ellis</i>, by Arthur
        Calder-Marshall, p. 88
        </p><p><b>On eradicating 'bad stocks':</b><br/>
        The goal of eugenicists is "to prevent the multiplication of bad
        stocks," wrote Dr. Ernst Rudin in the April 1933 <i>Birth Control
        Review </i>(of which Sanger was editor). Another article exhorted Americans to "restrict the
        propagation of those physically, mentally and socially inadequate."
