<h2>The Miles Lewis Fellowship and Oration </h2>
<p>The Miles Lewis Fellowship was established at the University of Melbourne in 2018, with funding provided by the Vera Moore Foundation. Its purpose is to bring distinguished scholars in the history of architecture to the University annually or biennially, to deliver an oration and to engage in other research and/or teaching activities. It is fully funded with a professorial salary, travel and living costs &amp;c.</p>
<h2>The APTI Scanning Project</h2>
<p>The Association for Preservation Technology International, based in the USA, maintains an on-line Building Heritage Technology Library which contains and makes publicly accessible nearly ten thousand digitised publications. These are so far mainly of American origin, but the APT has identified in the Miles Lewis library collection approximately 600 publications which have not been scanned elsewhere in the world, and these are now being digitised. They contain some additional US material, as well as Australian, British and French and other items. This is the first international project of the Library, and it is funded by the Vera Moore Foundation, and conducted under the aegis the APT Australasian chapter.</p>
<h2>Collecting Architectural Drawings </h2>
<p>For the Australaian Chapter of the International Confederation of Architectural Museums, Miles Lewis has in preparation a manual for curators of architectural collections, provisionally entitled <em>Collecting Architectural Drawings.</em> Its purpose is twofold. Curators commonly have library or other training but no experience in dealing with architectural drawings. They need information on the purposes of drawings, how to interpret them, the materials  used for them, how to select and organise them in a collection, and many other matters. Apart from this essential function it is hoped that the manual will raise the profile of drawings collections and bring about a greater commitment from libraries and other institions which have hitherto been apathetic or inactive.</p>
