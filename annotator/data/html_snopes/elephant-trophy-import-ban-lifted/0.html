Parties, recognize that:</p><p>(1) Wildlife and plants are an irreplaceable part of the natural systems of the earth and must be protected for this and future generations.</p><p>(2) The value of wildlife and plants is ever-growing from the viewpoints of aesthetics, science, culture, recreation, and economics.</p><p>(3) Although countries should be the best protectors of their own wildlife and plants, international cooperation is essential to protect wildlife and plant species from over-exploitation through international trade.</p><p>(4) It is urgent that countries take appropriate measures to prevent illegal trade and ensure that any use of wildlife and plants is sustainable.</p><p>(c) <span style="font-style:italic">National legislation.</span> We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), implement CITES through the Endangered Species Act (ESA).</p>

</div><a name="se50.9.23_13"></a><h2 style="text-align:left">§23.3   What other wildlife and plant regulations may apply?</h2><p>(a) You may need to comply with other regulations in this subchapter that require a permit or have additional restrictions. Many CITES species are also covered by one or more parts of this subchapter or title and have additional requirements:</p><p>(1) Part 15 (exotic birds).</p><p>(2) Part 16 (injurious wildlife).</p><p>(3) Parts 17 of this subchapter and 222, 223, and 224 of this title (endangered and threatened species).</p><p>(4) Parts 18 of this subchapter and 216 of this title (marine mammals).</p><p>(5) Part 20 (migratory bird hunting).</p><p>(6) Part 21 (migratory birds).</p><p>(7) Part 22 (bald and golden eagles).</p><p>(b) If you are applying for a permit, you must comply with the general permit procedures in part 13 of this subchapter. Definitions and a list of birds protected under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act can be found in part 10 of this subchapter.</p><p>(c) If you are importing (including introduction from the sea), exporting, or re-exporting wildlife or plants, you must comply with the regulations in part 14 of this subchapter for wildlife or part 24 of this subchapter for plants. Activities with plants are also regulated by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) and Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), in 7 CFR parts 319, 355, and 356.</p><p>(d) You may also need to comply with other Federal, State, tribal, or local requirements.</p>

</div><a name="se50.9.23_14"></a><h2 style="text-align:left">§23.4   What are Appendices I, II, and III?</h2><p>Species are listed by the Parties in one of three Appendices to the Treaty (see subpart H of this part), each of which provides a different level of protection and is subject to different requirements. Parties regulate trade in specimens of Appendix-I, -II, and -III species and their parts, products, and derivatives through a system of permits and certificates (CITES documents). Such documents enable Parties to monitor the effects of the volume and type of trade to ensure trade is legal and not detrimental to the survival of the species.</p><p>(a) <span style="font-style:italic">Appendix I</span> includes species threatened with extinction that are or may be affected by trade. Trade in Appendix-I specimens may take place only in exceptional circumstances.</p><p>(b) <span style="font-style:italic">Appendix II</span> includes species that are not presently threatened with extinction, but may become so if their trade is not regulated. It also includes species that need to be regulated so that trade in certain other Appendix-I or -II species may be effectively controlled; these species are most commonly listed due to their similarity of appearance to other related CITES species.</p><p>(c) <span style="font-style:italic">Appendix III</span> includes species listed unilaterally by a range country to obtain international cooperation in controlling trade.</p>

A reference annotation provides information that further explains the listing (such as “p.e.” for possibly extinct). A substantive annotation is an integral part of a species listing. It designates whether the listing includes or excludes a geographically separate population, subspecies, species, group of species, or higher taxon, and the types of specimens included in or excluded from the listing, such as certain parts, products, or derivatives. A substantive annotation may designate export quotas adopted by the CoP. For species transferred from Appendix I to II subject to an annotation relating to specified types of specimens, other types of specimens that are not specifically included in the annotation are treated as if they are Appendix-I specimens.</p><p><span style="font-style:italic">Appropriate and acceptable destination</span>, when used in an Appendix-II listing annotation for the export of, or international trade in, live animals, means that the Management Authority of the importing country has certified, based on advice from the Scientific Authority of that country, that the proposed recipient is suitably equipped to house and care for the animal (see criteria in §23.65).

To control any illegal trade, Parties are to inspect, to the extent possible under their national legislation, specimens in transit through their territory to verify the presence of valid documentation. See §23.50 for in-transit shipment of sample collections covered by an ATA carnet.</p><p>(b) <span style="font-style:italic">Document requirements.</span> An in-transit shipment does not require a CITES document from an intermediary country, but must be accompanied by all of the following documents:</p><p>(1) Unless the specimen qualifies for an exemption under §23.92, a valid original CITES document, or a copy of the valid original CITES document, that designates the name of the importer in the country of final destination and is issued by the Management Authority of the exporting or re-exporting country. A copy of a CITES document is subject to verification.</p><p>(2) For shipment of an Appendix-I specimen, a copy of a valid import permit that designates the name of the importer in the country of final destination, unless the CITES document in paragraph (b)(1) of this section is a CITES exemption document (see §23.20(d)).</p><p>(3) Transportation and routing documents that show the shipment has been consigned to the same importer and country of final destination as designated on the CITES document.</p><p>(c) <span style="font-style:italic">Shipment requirements.</span> An in-transit shipment, including items in an on-board store, must meet the following:</p><p>(1) When in an intermediary country, an in-transit shipment must stay only for the time needed to immediately transfer the specimen to the mode of transport used to continue to the final destination and remain under customs control. Other than during immediate transfer, the specimen may not be stored in a duty-free, bonded, or other kind of warehouse or a free trade zone.</p><p>(2) At any time during transit, an in-transit shipment must not be sold, manipulated, or split unless authorized by the Management Authority of the intermediary country for inspection or enforcement purposes.</p><p>(d) <span style="font-style:italic">Reserving Party or non-Party.</span> All the requirements of this section apply to shipments to or from a reserving Party or non-Party that are being transshipped through a Party.

This means that an Appendix-I specimen originating from a commercial breeding operation that is registered with the CITES Secretariat may be traded under an export permit or re-export certificate based on Appendix-II criteria. The specimen is still listed in Appendix I and is not eligible for any exemption granted to an Appendix-II species or taxon, including any exemption granted by an annotation (see §23.92).</p><p>(b) <span style="font-style:italic">U.S. and foreign general provisions.</span> The following provisions apply to the registration of U.S. and foreign commercial breeding operations for Appendix-I wildlife:</p><p>(1) If the Management Authority is satisfied that the operation in its country meets the conditions for registration in paragraph (d) of this section, it will send the request to register a breeding operation to the Secretariat.</p><p>(2) The Secretariat will verify that the application is complete and notify the Parties of the request.</p><p>(3) If any Party objects to or expresses concern about the registration within 90 days from the date of the Secretariat's notification, the Secretariat will refer the application to the Animals Committee. The Committee has 60 days to respond to objections. The Secretariat will provide the recommendations of the Committee to the Management Authority of the Party that submitted the application and the Party that objected to the registration, and will allow a further 30 days for resolution of the identified problems.</p><p>(4) If the objection is not withdrawn or the identified problems are not resolved within the 30-day period, the Secretariat will submit the application to the Standing Committee at its next regular meeting. The Standing Committee will determine whether the objection is justified and decide whether to accept the application.</p><p>(5) When the Secretariat is satisfied that the operation meets the registration requirements, it will include the operation in its register.</p><p>(6) Operations are assigned an identification number and listed in the official register. Registration is not final until the Secretariat notifies all Parties.</p><p>(7) If a Party believes that a registered operation does not meet the bred-in-captivity requirements, it may, after consultation with the Secretariat and the Party concerned, propose to the Standing Committee that the operation be deleted from the register. At its following meeting, the Standing Committee will consider the concerns raised by the objecting Party, and any comments from the registering Party and the Secretariat, and determine whether the operation should be deleted from the register. Once an operation has been deleted, it must re-apply and meet the registration requirements to be reinstated.</p><p>(8) The Management Authority, in collaboration with the Scientific Authority, of a country where any registered operation is located must monitor the operation to ensure that it continues to meet the registration requirements. In the United States, we will monitor registered operations, in part, by requiring each operation to apply for renewal and demonstrate that it continues to qualify for registration at least once every 5 years. (See paragraphs (e)(4) and (f) of this section.) The Management Authority will advise the Secretariat of any major change in the nature of the operation or in the types of products being produced for export.</p><p>(9) A Party may unilaterally request the removal of a registered operation within its jurisdiction by notifying the Secretariat.</p><p>(10) An Appendix-I specimen may not be imported for purposes of establishing or augmenting a commercial breeding operation, unless the specimen is pre-Convention (see §23.45) or was bred in captivity (see §23.63).</p><p>(c) <span style="font-style:italic">U.S. application to register.</span> Complete Form 3-200-65 and submit it to the U.S. Management Authority.</p><p>(d) <span style="font-style:italic">Criteria.</span> The criteria in this paragraph (d) apply to the registration of U.S. and foreign commercial breeding operations for Appendix-I wildlife.

style="font-style:italic">Status of the species</span>: From Appendix I to Appendix III.</p><p>(2) <span style="font-style:italic">Origin of the specimen</span>: From wild-collected to born or propagated in a controlled environment to bred in captivity or artificially propagated.</p><p>(3) <span style="font-style:italic">Source of the propagule used to grow the plant</span>: From documentation that the plant was grown from a non-exempt seed or seedling to documentation that the plant was grown from an exempt seed or seedling.</p><p>(4) <span style="font-style:italic">Origin of the species</span>: From species native to the United States or its bordering countries of Mexico or Canada to nonnative species from other countries.</p><p>(5) <span style="font-style:italic">Volume

controlled environment in the United States.</p><p>(9) <span style="font-style:italic">Ability of the species to be bred or propagated readily in a controlled environment</span>: From no documentation that the species can be bred or propagated readily in a controlled environment to widely accepted information that the species is commonly bred or propagated.</p><p>(10) <span style="font-style:italic">Genetic status of the specimen</span>: From a purebred species to a hybrid.</p><p>(e) <span style="font-style:italic">Captive-bred wildlife or a cultivated plant.</span> For a specimen that is captive-bred or cultivated, we may consider whether the parental stock was legally acquired.</p><p>(f) <span style="font-style:italic">Confiscated specimen.</span> For a confiscated Appendix-II or -III specimen, we consider whether information shows that the transfer of the confiscated specimen or its offspring met the conditions of the remission decision, legal settlement, or disposal action after forfeiture or abandonment.</p><p>(g) <span style="font-style:italic">Donated specimen of unknown origin.</span> For an unsolicited specimen of unknown origin donated to a public institution (see §10.12 of this subchapter), we consider whether:</p><p>(1) The public institution follows standard recordkeeping practices and has made reasonable efforts to obtain supporting information on the origin of the specimen.</p><p>(2) The public institution provides sufficient information to show it made a reasonable effort to find a suitable recipient in the United States.</p><p>(3) The export will provide a conservation benefit to the species.</p><p>(4) No persuasive information exists on illegal transactions involving the specimen.</p><p>(5) The export is noncommercial, with no money or barter exchanged except for shipping costs.</p><p>(6) The institution has no history of receiving a series of rare and valuable specimens or a large quantity of wildlife or plants of unknown origin.</p><p>(h) <span style="font-style:italic">Imported previously.</span> For a specimen that was previously imported into the United States, we consider any reliable, relevant information we receive concerning the validity of a CITES document, regardless of whether the shipment was cleared by FWS, APHIS, or CBP.</p><p>(i) <span style="font-style:italic">Personal use.</span> For a wildlife or plant specimen that is being exported or re-exported for personal use by the applicant, we consider whether:</p><p>(1) The specimen was acquired in the United States and possessed for strictly personal use.</p><p>(2) The number of specimens is reasonably appropriate for the nature of your export or re-export as personal use.</p><p>(3) No persuasive evidence exists on illegal transactions involving the specimen.</p><p>(j) <span style="font-style:italic">Sequential ownership.</span> For a specimen that was previously possessed by someone other than the applicant, we may consider the history of ownership for a specimen and its parental stock, breeding stock, or cultivated parental stock.</p><p>(k) <span style="font-style:italic">Wild-collected in the United States.</span> For a specimen collected from the wild in the United States, we consider the site where the specimen was collected, whether the species is known to occur at that site, the abundance of the species at that site, and, if necessary, whether permission of the appropriate management agency or landowner was obtained to collect the specimen.</p>

For Appendix-I species, it also includes use or removal from the wild that results in habitat loss or destruction, interference with recovery efforts for a species, or stimulation of further trade.</p><p>(c) <span style="font-style:italic">General factors.</span> The applicant must provide sufficient information for us to make a finding of non-detriment. In addition to factors in paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section, we will consider whether:</p><p>(1) Biological and management information demonstrates that the proposed activity represents sustainable use.</p><p>(2) The removal of the animal or plant from the wild is part of a biologically based sustainable-use management plan that is designed to eliminate over-utilization of the species.</p><p>(3) If no sustainable-use management plan has been established, the removal of the animal or plant from the wild would not contribute to the over-utilization of the species, considering both domestic and international uses.</p><p>(4) The proposed activity, including the methods used to acquire the specimen, would pose no net harm to the status of the species in the wild.</p><p>(5) The proposed activity would not lead to long-term declines that would place the viability of the affected population in question.</p><p>(6) The proposed activity would not lead to significant habitat or range loss or restriction.</p><p>(d) <span style="font-style:italic">Additional factor for Appendix-II species.</span> In addition to the general factors in paragraph (c) of this section, we will consider whether the intended export of an Appendix-II species would cause a significant risk that the species would qualify for inclusion in Appendix I.</p><p>(e) <span style="font-style:italic">Additional factors for Appendix-I species.</span> In addition to the general factors in paragraph (c) of this section, we will consider whether the proposed activity:</p><p>(1) Would not cause an increased risk of extinction for either the species as a whole or the population from which the specimen was obtained.</p><p>(2) Would not interfere with the recovery of the species.</p><p>(3) Would not stimulate additional trade in the species. If the proposed activity does stimulate trade, we will consider whether the anticipated increase in trade would lead to the decline of the species.</p><p>(f) <span style="font-style:italic">How we make our findings.</span> We base the non-detriment finding on the best available biological information. We also consider trade information, including trade demand, and other scientific management information. We make a non-detriment finding in the following way:</p><p>(1) We consult with the States, Tribes, other Federal agencies, scientists, other experts, and the range countries of the species.</p><p>(2) We consult with the Secretariat and other Parties to monitor the level of trade that is occurring in the species.</p><p>(3) Based on the factors in paragraphs (c) through (e) of this section, we evaluate the biological impact of the proposed activity.</p><p>(4) In cases where insufficient information is available or the factors above are not satisfactorily addressed, we take precautionary measures and would be unable to make the required finding of non-detriment.</p><p>(g) <span style="font-style:italic">Risk assessment.</span> We review the status of the species in the wild and the degree of risk the proposed activity poses to the species to determine the level of scrutiny needed to make a finding. We give greater scrutiny and require more detailed information for activities that pose a greater risk to a species in the wild. We consider the cumulative risks, recognizing that each aspect of international trade has a continuum of risk (from high to low) associated with it as follows:</p><p>(1) <span style="font-style:italic">Status of the species</span>: From Appendix I to Appendix II.</p><p>(2) <span style="font-style:italic">Origin of the specimen</span>: From wild-collected to born or propagated in a controlled environment to bred in captivity or artificially propagated.</p><p>(3) <span style="font-style:italic">Source of the propagule used to grow the plant</span>: From documentation that the plant was grown from a non-exempt seed or seedling to documentation that the plant was grown from an exempt seed or seedling.</p><p>(4) <span style="font-style:italic">Origin of the species</span>: From native species to nonnative species.</p><p>(5) <span style="font-style:italic">Volume of legal trade</span>: From high to low occurrence of legal trade.</p><p>(6) <span style="font-style:italic">Volume of illegal trade</span>: From high to low occurrence of illegal trade.</p><p>(7) <span style="font-style:italic">Type of trade</span>: From commercial to noncommercial.</p><p>(8) <span style="font-style:italic">Genetic status of the specimen</span>: From a purebred species to a hybrid.</p><p>(9) <span style="font-style:italic">Risk of disease transmission</span>: From high to limited risk of disease transmission.</p><p>(10) <span style="font-style:italic">Basis for listing</span>: From listed under Article II(1) or II(2)(a) of the Treaty to listed under Article II(2)(b).</p><p>(h) <span style="font-style:italic">Quotas for Appendix-I species.</span> When an export quota has been set by the CoP for an Appendix-I species, we will consider the scientific and management basis of the quota together with the best available biological information when we make our non-detriment finding. We will contact the Scientific and Management Authorities of the exporting country for further information if needed.</p>

Trade in Appendix-I species must be subject to particularly strict regulation and authorized only in exceptional circumstances.</p><p>(b) <span style="font-style:italic">How we make our findings.</span> We must find that the intended use of the Appendix-I specimen is not for primarily commercial purposes before we can issue a CITES document.</p><p>(1) We will make this decision on a case-by-case basis considering all available information.</p><p>(2) The applicant must provide sufficient information to satisfy us that the intended use is not for primarily commercial purposes.</p><p>(3) The definitions of “commercial” and “primarily commercial purposes” in §23.5 apply.</p><p>(4) We will look at all aspects of the intended use of the specimen. If the noncommercial aspects do not clearly predominate, we will consider the import or introduction from the sea to be for primarily commercial purposes.</p><p>(5) While the nature of the transaction between the owner in the country of export and the recipient in the country of import or introduction from the sea may have some commercial aspects, such as the exchange of money to cover the costs of shipment and care of specimens during transport, it is the intended use of the specimen, including the purpose of the export, that must not be for primarily commercial purposes.</p><p>(6) We will conduct an assessment of factors listed in paragraph (d) of this section. For activities involving an anticipated measurable increase in revenue and other economic value associated with the intended use, we will conduct an analysis as described in paragraph (e) of this section.</p><p>(7) All net profits generated in the United States from activities associated with the import of an Appendix-I species must be used for conservation of that species.</p><p>(c) <span style="font-style:italic">Examples.</span> The following are examples of types of transactions in which the noncommercial aspects of the intended use of the specimen may predominate depending on the facts of each situation. The discussions of each example provide further guidance in assessing the actual degree of commerciality on a case-by-case basis. These examples outline circumstances commonly encountered and do not cover all situations where import or introduction from the sea could be found to be not for primarily commercial purposes.</p><p>(1) <span style="font-style:italic">Personal use.</span> Import or introduction from the sea of an Appendix-I specimen for personal use generally is considered to be not for primarily commercial purposes. An example is the import of a personal sport-hunted trophy by the person who hunted the wildlife for display in his or her own home.</p><p>(2) <span style="font-style:italic">Scientific purposes.</span> The import or introduction from the sea of an Appendix-I specimen by a scientist or scientific institution may be permitted in situations where resale, commercial exchange, or exhibit of the specimen for economic benefit is not the primary intended use.</p><p>(3) <span style="font-style:italic">Conservation, education, or training.</span> Generally an Appendix-I specimen may be imported or introduced from the sea by government agencies or nonprofit institutions for purposes of conservation, education, or training. For example, a specimen could be imported or introduced from the sea primarily to train customs staff in effective CITES control, such as for identification of certain types of specimens.</p><p>(4) <span style="font-style:italic">Biomedical industry.</span> Import or introduction from the sea of an Appendix-I specimen by an institution or company in the biomedical industry is initially presumed to be commercial since specimens are typically imported or introduced from the sea to develop and sell products that promote public health for profit. However, if the importer clearly shows that the sale of products is only incidental to public health research and not for the primary purpose of economic benefit or profit, then such an import or introduction from the sea could be considered as scientific research under paragraph (c)(2) of this section if the principles of paragraph (b) of this section are met.</p><p>(5) <span style="font-style:italic">Captive-breeding or artificial propagation programs.</span> The import of an Appendix-I specimen for purposes of establishing a commercial operation for breeding or artificial propagation is considered to be for primarily commercial purposes. As a general rule, import or introduction from the sea of an Appendix-I specimen for a captive-breeding or artificial propagation program must have as a priority the long-term protection and recovery of the species in the wild. The captive-breeding or artificial propagation program must be part of a program aimed at the recovery of the species in the wild and be undertaken with the support of a country within the species' native range. Any profit gained must be used to support this recovery program. If a captive-breeding or artificial propagation operation plans to sell surplus specimens to help offset the costs of its program, import or introduction from the sea would be allowed only if any profit would be used to support the captive-breeding or artificial propagation program to the benefit of the Appendix-I species, not for the personal economic benefit of a private individual or share-holder.</p><p>(6) <span style="font-style:italic">Professional dealers.</span> Import or introduction from the sea by a professional dealer who states a general intention to eventually sell the specimen or its offspring to an undetermined recipient would be considered to be for primarily commercial purposes. However, import or introduction from the sea through a professional dealer by a qualified applicant may be acceptable if the ultimate intended use would be for one of the purposes set out in paragraphs (c)(2), (3), and (5) of this section and where a binding contract, conditioned on the issuing of permits, is in place.</p><p>(d) <span style="font-style:italic">Risk assessment.</span> We review the factors listed in this paragraph (d) to assess the level of scrutiny and amount of information we need to make a finding of whether the intended use of the specimen is not for primarily commercial purposes. We give less scrutiny and require less detailed information when the import or introduction from the sea poses a low risk of being primarily commercial, and give more scrutiny and require more detailed information when the proposed activity poses greater risk. We consider the cumulative risks, recognizing that each aspect of the international trade has a continuum of risk from high to low associated with it as follows:</p><p>(1) <span style="font-style:italic">Type of importer</span>: From for-profit entity to private individual to nonprofit entity.</p><p>(2) <span style="font-style:italic">Ability of the proposed uses to generate revenue</span>: From the ability to generate measurable increases in revenue or other economic value to no anticipated increases in revenue or other economic value.</p><p>(3) <span style="font-style:italic">Appeal of the species</span>: From high public appeal to low public appeal.</p><p>(4) <span style="font-style:italic">Occurrence of the species in the United States</span>: From uncommon to common in a controlled environment in the United States.</p><p>(5) <span style="font-style:italic">Intended use of offspring</span>: From commercial to noncommercial.</p><p>(e) <span style="font-style:italic">Analysis of anticipated revenues and other economic value.</span> We will analyze revenues and other economic value anticipated to result from the use of the specimen for activities with a high risk of being primarily commercial.</p><p>(1) We will examine the proposed use of any net profits generated in the United States. We consider net profit to include all funds or other valuable considerations (including enhanced value of common stock shares) received or attained by you or those affiliated with you as a result of the import or introduction from the sea, to the extent that such funds or other valuable considerations exceed the reasonable expenses that are properly attributable to the proposed activity.</p><p>(2) We will consider any conservation project to be funded and, if the species was or is to be taken from the wild, how the project benefits the species in its native range, including agreements, timeframes for accomplishing tasks, and anticipated benefits to the species.</p><p>(3) We will consider any plans to monitor a proposed conservation project, including expenditure of funds or completion of tasks.</p><p>(4) In rare cases involving unusually high net profits, we will require the applicant to provide a detailed analysis of expected revenue (both direct and indirect) and expenses to show anticipated net profit, and a statement from a licensed, independent certified public accountant that the internal accounting system is sufficient to account for and track funds generated by the proposed activities.</p>

The cultivated parental stock must meet all of the following criteria:</p><p>(1) Was established in accordance with the provisions of CITES and relevant national laws.</p><p>(2) Was established in a manner not detrimental to the survival of the species in the wild.</p><p>(3) Is maintained in sufficient quantities for propagation so as to minimize or eliminate the need for augmentation from the wild, with such augmentation occurring only as an exception and limited to the amount necessary to maintain the vigor and productivity of the cultivated parental stock.</p><p>(d) <span style="font-style:italic">Cutting or division.</span> A plant grown from a cutting or division is considered to be artificially propagated only if the traded specimen does not contain any material collected from the wild.</p><p>(e) <span style="font-style:italic">Grafted plant.</span> A grafted plant is artificially propagated only when both the rootstock and the material grafted to it have been taken from specimens that were artificially propagated in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section.

When determining whether a species qualifies for inclusion in or removal from Appendix I or II, or transfer from one Appendix to another, we will:</p><p>(1) Consult with States, Tribes, range countries, relevant experts, other Federal agencies, and the general public.</p><p>(2) Utilize the best available biological information.</p><p>(3) Evaluate that information against the criteria in paragraphs (b) through (f) of this section.</p><p>(b<span style="font-style:italic">) Listing a species in Appendix I.</span> Any species qualifies for inclusion in Appendix I if it is or may be affected by trade and meets, or is likely to meet, at least one biological criterion for Appendix I.</p><p>(1) These criteria are:</p><p>(i) The size of the wild population is small.</p><p>(ii) Area of distribution is restricted.</p><p>(iii) There is an observed, inferred, or projected marked decline in the population size in the wild.</p><p>(2) Factors to be considered include, but are not limited to, population and range fragmentation; habitat availability or quality; area of distribution; taxon-specific vulnerabilities due to life history, behavior, or other intrinsic factors, such as migration; population structure and niche requirements; threats from extrinsic factors such as the form of exploitation, introduced species, habitat degradation and destruction, and stochastic events; or decreases in recruitment.</p><p>(c) <span style="font-style:italic">Listing a species in Appendix II due to actual or potential threats.</span> Any species qualifies for inclusion in Appendix II if it is or may be affected by trade and meets at least one of the criteria for listing in Appendix II based on actual or potential threats to that species. These criteria are:</p><p>(1) It is known, or can be inferred or projected, that the regulation of trade is necessary to avoid the species becoming eligible for inclusion in Appendix I in the near future.</p><p>(2) It is known, or can be inferred or projected, that the regulation of trade in the species is required to ensure that the harvest of specimens from the wild is not reducing the wild population to a level at which its survival might be threatened by continued harvest or other influences.</p><p>(d) <span style="font-style:italic">Listing a species in Appendix II due to similarity of appearance or other factors.</span> Any species qualifies for inclusion in Appendix II if it meets either of the criteria for listing in Appendix II due to similarity of appearance or other factors. These criteria are:</p><p>(1) The specimens of the species in the form in which they are traded resemble specimens of a species listed in Appendix II due to criteria in paragraph (c) of this section or in Appendix I, such that enforcement officers who encounter specimens of such similar CITES species are unlikely to be able to distinguish between them.</p><p>(2) There are compelling reasons other than those in paragraph (d)(1) of this section to ensure that effective control of trade in currently listed species is achieved.</p><p>(e) <span style="font-style:italic">Other issues.</span> We will evaluate any potential changes to the Appendices, taking into consideration other issues, including but not limited to, split-listing, annotation, listings of higher taxa and hybrids, and specific listing issues related to plants and commercially exploited aquatic species.</p><p>(f) <span style="font-style:italic">Precautionary measures.</span> We will evaluate any potential transfers from Appendix I to II or removal of species from the Appendices in the context of precautionary measures.</p><p>(g) <span style="font-style:italic">Proposal.</span> If a Party determines that a taxon qualifies for inclusion in or removal from Appendix I or II, or transfer from one Appendix to another, a proposal may be submitted to the Secretariat for consideration by the CoP.</p><p>(1) The proposal should indicate the intent of the specific action (such as inclusion in Appendix I or II); be specific and accurate as to the parts and derivatives to be included in the listing; ensure that any proposed annotation is consistent with existing annotations; state the criteria against which the proposal is to be judged; and provide a justification for the basis on which the species meets the relevant criteria.</p><p>(2) The proposal must be in a prescribed format.

The listing will become effective 90 days after the Secretariat notifies the Parties of the request.</p><p>(c) <span style="font-style:italic">Criteria for listing.</span> For a Party to list a species in Appendix III, all of the following criteria must be met:</p><p>(1) The species must be native to the country listing the species.</p><p>(2) The species must be protected under that country's laws or regulations to prevent or restrict exploitation and control trade, and the laws or regulations are being implemented.</p><p>(3) The species is in international trade, and there are indications that the cooperation of other Parties would help to control illegal trade.</p><p>(4) The listing Party must inform the Management Authorities of other range countries, the known major importing countries, the Secretariat, and the Animals Committee or the Plants Committee that it is considering the listing and seek their opinions on the potential effects of the listing.</p><p>(d) <span style="font-style:italic">Annotation.</span> The listing Party may annotate the Appendix-III listing to include only specific parts, products, derivatives, or life stages, as long as the Secretariat is notified of the annotation.</p><p>(e) <span style="font-style:italic">U.S. procedure.</span> The procedure to list a species native to the United States in Appendix III is as follows:</p><p>(1) We will consult with and solicit comments from all States and Tribes where the species occurs and all other range countries.</p><p>(2) We will publish a proposed rule in the <span style="font-variant:small-caps;font-weight:normal">Federal Register</span> to solicit comments from the public.</p><p>(3) If after evaluating the comments received and available information we determine the species should be listed in Appendix III, we will publish a final rule in the <span style="font-variant:small-caps;font-weight:normal">Federal Register</span> and notify the Secretariat of the listing.</p><p>(f) <span style="font-style:italic">Removing a species from Appendix III.</span> We will monitor the international trade in Appendix-III species listed by us and periodically evaluate whether each species continues to meet the listing criteria in paragraph (c) of this section. We will remove a species from Appendix III provided all of the following criteria are met:</p><p>(1) International trade in the species is very limited. As a general guide, we will consider removal when exports involve fewer than 5 shipments per year or fewer than 100 individual animals or plants.</p><p>(2) Legal and illegal trade in the species, including international trade or interstate commerce, is determined not to be a concern.</p><p>(g) <span style="font-style:italic">Transferring a species from Appendix III to Appendix I or II.</span> If, after monitoring the trade and evaluating the status of an Appendix-III species we listed, we determine that the species meets the criteria in §23.89(b) through (d) of this section for listing in Appendix I or II, we will consider whether to submit a proposal to amend the listing at the next CoP.</p>
