<h2>HEAVEN IS HOTTER THAN HELL</h2>

The temperature of heaven can be rather accurately computed. Our
authority is the Bible, Isaiah 30:26 reads, 

<blockquote><i>
         Moreover, the light of the moon shall be as the light of
         the sun and the light of the sun shall be sevenfold as the
         light of seven days.
</i></blockquote>

Thus, heaven receives from the moon as much radiation as the earth does
from the sun, and in addition seven times seven (forty nine) times as much
as the earth does from the sun, or fifty times in all. The light we
receive from the moon is one ten-thousandth of the light we receive from
the sun, so we can ignore that. With these data we can compute the
temperature of heaven:  The radiation falling on heaven will heat it to
the point where the heat lost by radiation is just equal to the heat
received by radiation. In other words, heaven loses fifty times as much
heat as the earth by radiation. Using the Stefan-Boltzmann fourth power
law for radiation

<center>(H/E)<sup>4</sup> = 50</center><p>

where E is the absolute temperature of the earth, 300°K (273+27). 
This gives H the absolute temperature of heaven, as 798°
absolute (525°C).</p><p>

The exact temperature of hell cannot be computed but it must be less than 
444.6°C, the temperature at which brimstone or sulfur changes from a
liquid to a gas. Revelations 21:8:

<em>
          But the fearful and unbelieving... shall have their part in
          the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone."
</em>

A lake of molten brimstone [sulfur] means that its temperature must
be at or below the boiling point, which is 444.6°C. (Above that point,
it would be a vapor, not a lake.)</p><p>

We have then, temperature of heaven, 525°C.
Temperature of hell, less than 445°C. 

Therefore heaven
is hotter than hell.</p><p>

<h2>A REFUTATION OF THE PROOF THAT HEAVEN IS HOTTER THAN
HELL</h2>
<b>Dr. Tim Healey, F. R. C. R.; M. I. Nuc. E.</b><p>

In Applied Optics (1972, <i>11</i> A14) there appeared a
calculation of the respective temperatures of Heaven and
Hell. That of Heaven was computed by substituting the
values given in Isaiah 30 <i>26</i> [1] in the Stefan-Boltzman 
radiation law, so that (H/E)<sup>4</sup> = 50,
where E, the absolute temperature of the Earth, is
300ºK, whence the temperature of Heaven, H, is 798ºK or
525ºC. This is hard to find fault with.</p><p>

The assessment of the temperature of Hell stands, I
suggest, on less firm ground. As authority we use the data
provided in Revelations 21 <i>8</i> [2], so that the temperature of
Hell seems to be 444.6ºC–the temperature at which liquid
sulfur is in equilibrium with its vapour–a temperature
indeed which is sufficiently reliable to be used in the 
secondary calibration of pyrometers.</p><p>

Now this last reckoning fails to follow the argument
through. 444.6ºC is the temperature at which liquid sulfur is
in equilibrium with its vapour at normal atmospheric pressure. 
Have we any data as to the pressure likely to be found
in Hell?</p><p>

The answer is "Yes". A nineteenth century mathematician 
has already provided the groundwork for us [3] and we
may feel confident that by the year 2000 the total number of
the damned will be at least 29,422,641,251,519,917,000 souls.
Yet the area of the valley of Gehinnom [4] is only
7,000,000 square meters.</p><p>

We can now apply these figures in the Ideal Gas Equation to
calculate what the pressure will be in the valley of Gehinnom. 
Since surely some souls must have been damned since
1877 [5], the pressure can only have increased since these
calculations were made and the equilibrium point on the
phase diagram of sulfur must have shifted still further, so that
if we can show that at a temperature of 525ºC sulfur would
still be liquid at the pressure calculated (which is a minimum
value, remember), Hell (Gehinnom) is now cooler than Heaven.</p><p>

Certain corrections must be applied first, however.</p><p>

1. Neiht based his calculation on a date of creation of
1658 + 2326 - 1877 = 2107 BC (minimum). Counting
generations in the Bible gives a date for the Creation of
4004 BC. However, atomic dating has shown that
Olduvai man is at least 2 × 10<sup>6</sup> years old [6].</p><p>

2. We should use a Fibonacci series for the expansion, not
a simple doubling series. [7] The ancient Jewish laws
against inbreeding also act in the same direction. [8]</p><p>

3. By a fortunate coincidence, the effects of 1 and 2
cancel each other exactly. [9]</p><p>

4. The human body is not an ideal gas, but</p><p>

5. A good deal of it is gaseous at 525ºC, and in any case,</p><p>

6. It could well be that at very great pressures the external
pressure may well exceed the pressure of electromagnetic 
repulsion, when different "gas" laws would apply. 
This merely explains how the Lord works in fitting
so large a number of damned souls into so small a
space [10] and it need not be quantitative.</p><p>

In the calculation the following assumptions are made:</p><p>

1. The average height can be taken as one meter. This
seems a fair figure between the newborn babe and the
fullgrown man.</p><p>

2. The average space needed is about 30 cm × 20 cm. It
seems unlikely that any closer packing could be achieved. 
Neiht uses a figure of 1/20 cubic meters per
person, which is nearly identical with my independent
assessment. Mine allows a neat cancellation, later.</p><p>

3. I have assumed that not more than two layers of
damned persons can be accommodated, since otherwise 
those in the middle layers would escape the full
rigours of Hell. </p><p>

So that,</p><p>

The volume available in Gehenna is 60 × 10<sup>6</sup> × 
2 m<sup>3</sup> and</p><p>

The original volume of the damned is 0.06 × 29.422641 × 
10<sup>18</sup>m<sup>3</sup></p><p>

Then, at constant temperature (which we assume, taking equilibrium)</p><p>

P<sub>1</sub>V<sub>1</sub> = P<sub>2</sub>V<sub>2</sub> 
or P<sub>2</sub> = P<sub>1</sub>V<sub>1</sub>/V<sub>2</sub></p><p>

Substituting,</p><p>
</p><table align="right" border="0"><tbody><tr><td>(1)</td></tr></tbody></table>
P<sub>2</sub> = [29 × 6 × 10<sup>16</sup>] / 
[2 × 6 × 10<sup>7</sup>]
= 14.5 × 10<sup>9</sup> atmospheres <p>

Now let us see what pressure is needed to liquefy sulfur
vapour at 525ºC.</p><p>

We have, using the Clausius-Cleypeyron equation in its
integrated form,</p><p>

Log P = 7.43287 - 3268.2 / T</p><p>

where P = pressure in mm Hg</p><p>

and T = the elevated boiling point in ºK,</p><p>

so that</p><p>

Log P = 7.43287 - (3268.2/798) = 3.3373813</p><p>

whence,</p><p>
</p><table align="right" border="0"><tbody><tr><td>(2)</td></tr></tbody></table>
P = 2174.607 mm Hg = 2.86 atmospheres <p>

(1) is so much greater than (2) that Revelations 21 <i>8</i>
indicates a temperature very considerably higher than
525ºC.</p><p>

Thus, Hell is hotter than Heaven (which remains
deucedly hot).</p><p>

3. <em>A Mathematical Proof of the Non-Existence of Hell</em> 
from the writings of the
free-thinker Neiht, born in Brussels, 1877. "The area of the valley of
Jehoshaphat is 60,000,000 sq. ms. ... Supposing that each race originated
with one couple only, one has five couples or ten people, and applying to
them the principle of compound interest, up to the Flood there were
9,289,000 births in 1,658 years. Since the Flood up to our epoch 2,326
years have passed, during which, if only five couples survived, they would
have produced 2,213,867,610,000 children. If these calculations are 
extended up to the year 2000, the resulting number is 
34,326,414,259,675,172,000 which, together with the 9,289,000, makes 
34,326,414,259,684,461,000 offspring. If one concedes, charitably, 
that all papists are saved, their number today being 1/7th of the 
population of the earth, that of
the damned would be made up of those born before the Flood plus those
born since the Flood up to the year 2000 minus the 1/7th of those born
since the year 44, that of the birth of Christ: this number is
4,903,773,008,164,544,000, and the total of damned would be 
29,422,641,251,519,917,000.</p><p>

"The mean cubic area between a new-born infant and an adult is about
1/20th metre; the bulk of the damned above is equal to the mass of a sphere
of radius 705,504 metres; that of the earth is 6,366,200 metres.</p><p>

"If one puts back the origin of man, following certain German naturalists, 
to 80,000 years, the number of damned would form a cube three
times the size of the earth.</p><p>

"Now, how does one assemble the 34,326,414,260 millions risen on a
surface of 60,000,000 sq. metres to judge them and how does one sink this
mass of damned, through all manner of rock, to a depth of 5,660,660
metres?"</p><p>

[4] The valley of Jehoshaphat is the Gehenna of the Jews (Jehennam in the
Koran)–the place of eternal torment. The word is derived from
Gehinnom = the valley of Hinnom where sacrifices were offered to Moloch (2
Corinthians 33 <i>6</i>) (= Adremmelech–the God of Sepharvaim). In
later times, all manner of refuse was dumped there and fires were
constantly maintained to consume it. The sulfurous stench and the fire was
the original of the Christian concept of Hell. (The estimate of Nieht of
Gehenna's area 60 × 10<sup>6</sup> sq. m. is wrong, according to
measurements taken on the spot by the Editors).</p><p>

</p><h2>IS HEAVEN EXOTHERMIC OR ENDOTHERMIC?</h2>
<blockquote>
I've received a number of requests to include one more scientific/theological parody using thermodynamics. This one showed up in a humor post to the newsgroup rec.humor in 1997. It has been "going around" ever since as a "true story" in several variants. But that's surely bogus. See <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170204005441/http://www.snopes.com/college/exam/hell.asp">snopes.com</a> for a discussion.
</blockquote>

A true story. A thermodynamics professor had written a take home exam for his graduate students. It had one question: "Is hell exothermic or endothermic? Support your answer with a proof." Most of the students wrote proofs of their beliefs using Boyle's Law or some variant. One student, however, wrote the following:<p> 

First, we postulate that if souls exist, then they must have some mass. If they do, then a mole of souls can also have a mass. So, at what rate are souls moving into hell and at what rate are souls leaving? I think that we can safely assume that once a soul gets to hell, it will not leave. Therefore, no souls are leaving. </p><p>

As for souls entering hell, lets look at the different religions that exist in the world today. Some of these religions state that if you are not a member of their religion, you will go to hell. Since there are more than one of these religions and people do not belong to more than one religion, we can project that all people and all souls go to hell. With birth and death rates as they are, we can expect the number of souls in hell to increase exponentially. </p><p>

Now, we look at the rate of change in volume in hell. Boyle's Law states that in order for the temperature and pressure in hell to stay the same, the ratio of the mass of souls and volume needs to stay constant. So, if hell is expanding at a slower rate than the rate at which souls enter hell, then the temperature and pressure in hell will increase until all hell breaks loose. Of course, if hell is expanding at a rate faster than the increase of souls in hell, then the temperature and pressure will drop until hell freezes over. </p><p>

It was not revealed what grade the student got.</p><p>
</p><center><hr width="80%"/></center>
<blockquote>
Notes from snopes.com:<p>

Variations: Commonly, the piece will begin with a statement meant to authenticate the story. "An actual question given on University of Washington chemistry midterm," "from a Yale professor," and "Dr. Schambaugh, of the University of Oklahoma School of Chemical Engineering, Final Exam question for May of 1997" have so far been spotted. </p><p>

In some versions the student's comments culminate in the assertion that hell must be exothermic because a girl he'd been chasing had sworn it'd be a cold day in hell before she'd sleep with him, and he'd so far been unable to get to first base with her. Often the story concludes with "The student received the only 'A' given on the exam." </p><p>

Notes by D. E. S.</p><p>

These unattributed distributions with false claims of "a true story" are simply annoying, and also unfair to the original authors. The roots of this joke have been traced back to about 1920, to a piece written by Paul Darwin Foote in a house publication of the Taylor Instrument Company. If anyone knows of an earlier appearance, please let me know. Also, if anyone has the original version, I'd like to see it. </p><p>

I haven't yet seen the original version. This piece does not compare temperatures of Heaven and Hell. It begins with the "assumption that souls have mass". Mass is never an issue in the other two. It also assumes souls have volume. The "logic" is completely different in these various parodies. </p><p>

It seems to me far-fetched to connect the later parodies with the Foote parody. Nor am I convinced that Foote's piece "inspired" the others. I see no case that could be made for plagiarism. </p><p>

A good rule is "Whenever a story begins with 'This is a true story...' you can be sure it isn't so." I encountered a lot of this sort of thing when I was compiling a book of science humor, "Science Askew". People suggested to me innumerable anecdotes attributed to famous scientists and mathematicians, all purporting to be "true". The trouble was that the same stories were often attributed to different persons and from different places. I have come to assume that they are all inventions, or at least heavily embellished, unless some serious documentation is provided. The same is true for "quotes". The "If I have seen further than others..." quote widely attributed to Isaac Newton has been traced back to a Roman Poet Lucan (39-65 CE). So another rule is "If something is catchy enough to be attributed to someone famous, it really had its origin much earlier, probably with someone less famous." You can quote me on that. </p><p>

Finally, some readers quibbled about a misprint in the temperature of Hell that I had in the final line of the parody from <i>Applied Optics</i>, which I think is now corrected, though I still don't have access to the original printed copy. If anyone still doubts the result for the temperature of Hell, we suggest they apply the experimental method and go to the source carrying an accurate thermometer. But if anyone has access to the paper copy in <i>Applied Optics</i> I'd be happy to receive a scan of it. </p><p>

No one has (yet) faulted the calculation of the temperature of Heaven. Perhaps none are expecting to go there. </p><p>
